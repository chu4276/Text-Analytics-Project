1,county,my good friends minoo riahysharifan (orange county) and nargis virani (new school) also read the ﬁrst draft of the manuscript.
2,chapel,an initial phone conversation with carl ernst (university of north carolina at chapel hill) was seminal in the shaping of the work.
3,where,"the townspeople, who had never seen an elephant before, gathered outside the place where the animal was housed, curious as to what the beast was like."
4,question,"the challenge is to see each other’s humanity, and the question is: where are the candles?"
5,death,"1  introduction  in short, since 9/11, knowing about the muslim middle east is not a luxury, it is a matter of life and death."
6,authority,the old narrative was imbued with the authority of an allknowing foreign expert.
7,power,"they show awareness of the power of personal voice, nostalgia in exilic literature, the assurance that comes with insider knowledge, and the certainty of eyewitness accounts."
8,case,"for this purpose, i have selected a speciﬁc title from the above list as my case in point."
9,authority,"we take pride in resisting authority, in being self-critical and demanding."
10,wall,"for every newly erected wall, many barriers fall down."
11,freedom,"it may not be easy to see our full human potential for crossing borders, for living outside boxes, for embracing the freedom of dwelling on thresholds."
12,building,"i have a little gray cat, and if you are brave enough to build a bridge, my cat and i might walk over.’’ at times, it is hard to even contemplate the building of the bridge."
13,war,this is no ideological war for or against any.
14,power,we will object to the imposing vision of a revolution that stiﬂes the power to dream.
15,power,"as a teacher and scholar of literature, i feel we should take very seriously the distorting and silencing power that such texts exercise on our culture and society."
16,assault,"like a cat carrying its newborns to safety, i hold my students close as we hunt for balanced and engaging literature that might save their critical faculty from the numbing assault of the media, particularly when it comes to discussions of iran and islam."
17,question,"the feel-in-the-dark method of describing life in iran, evidenced in works such as rlt, further hampers the critical ability to question the narrow and slanted vision provided by the popular media."
18,where,the jasmine and stars in this book’s title are metaphors for what ﬁlled my childhood and youth—which were by no means trouble free—with culturally speciﬁc inspirations that have brought me to where i am.
19,where,"i grew up in the historic city of shiraz in southwest iran, where i went to school and university."
20,freedom,"gender equality, freedom of the press, freedom of the academic world, and the right of religious minorities to unrestricted practice of their faiths are among the most important."
21,imprisonment,"early in the book, one of the students shares the story of her imprisonment and ﬂogging with the reading group."
22,punishment,"‘‘in some perverse way,’’ the author suggests, the punishment was a ‘‘source of satisfaction’’ to the young woman (rlt, 73)."
23,punishment,"harsh as the punishment itself is, rlt ’s comment on the incident wounds as well by stereotyping muslim women as passive, even masochistic victims."
24,where,"where peaceful means have not failed, a revolution does not take place."
25,case,"what is happening in the non-western parts of the world, and in this case iran, is a result of decades, at times centuries, of unresolved issues."
26,term,these range from the outright colonization of territories and reckless pursuit of short-term economic 10  introduction  goals to cultural illiteracy and disrespect.
27,injustice,"the resulting injustice, poverty, and totalitarianism are now exploding in our faces."
28,where,"it continues with memories of later years in england, where i found and published a most exquisitely illustrated persian manuscript dated 1410."
29,death,"11  introduction  i then introduce you to a daring and imaginative poet of twentiethcentury iran, forough farrokhzad, discussing her poetry as well as the way my friends and i in high school reacted to her life and death."
30,where,"i have picked the stars from the midsummer nights in the shiraz of my childhood and youth, and the jasmine blossoms from grandma’s prayer rug where she kept them."
31,where,"12  1 the jasmine, the stars, & the grasshoppers  in shiraz of the 1960s, where i grew up, summer nights were a journey with a few clear stops."
32,where,"in his singing, there was a sense of peace with the night that made me grateful for being who i was and where i was."
33,wall,"she would walk around the yard, quietly water the plants, and pick little, white jasmine 14  the jasmine, the stars, & the grasshoppers  blossoms from the tree that had climbed one wall of the yard all the way to the top."
34,inside,my grandmother somehow associated these ﬂowers with prayer and collected fresh jasmine to keep inside her prayer rug until the next morning.
35,inside,"i would go inside, keep the windows closed, and be suspicious of every green spot that appeared to be moving."
36,where,"and glad to be heading home!’’ then i got to the cash register, where a bubbly young girl with an extraordinary pair of green earrings was the cashier."
37,power,"i am recounting the incident merely to explain what i mean by the power of the storyline in the background, the one that takes away our freedom to imagine each other."
38,taken,the slanted vision of books such as rlt is not to be taken lightly.
39,power,"the blurb promises the book to be an ‘‘exploration of the resilience’’ of these people ‘‘in the face of tyranny and a celebration of the liberating power of literature.’’ in fact, the book can be many things to many people."
40,where,"graham chapel, where the presentation was held, was ﬁlled with a large audience, many of them iranian americans."
41,power,"on the one hand, rlt critiqued totalitarianism and endorsed the transformative and liberating power of literature."
42,power,"now this book, which meant to celebrate the power of literature, denied and erased this most prevalent cultural behavior in the society i knew so well."
43,arrest,even the revolutionary guard who came to arrest a member of the armed opposition hid behind a woman servant in the author’s house for fear of being shot.
44,freedom,"with no reference to serious problems that plagued iran under the shah, the revolution itself appeared to have been motivated by a longing for fanaticism and a dislike for freedom and modernization."
45,where,"a  on the day rlt was to be introduced in our assembly series, i walked through the campus toward the chapel where i would make my introductory remarks."
46,chapel,the doors of the chapel were open and people were coming in.
47,chapel,the chapel was now full.
48,serving,"these latter sat at tasteful small tables with fragile candles on terraces overlooking the pool, serving homemade wine."
49,power,a  the author’s presentation that day was as much about the dark deeds of the iranian revolution as it was about the healing power of literature.
50,authority,what they had read as a personal memoir moved between the liberty of writing ﬁction and the authority of an all-knowing political observer.
51,jail,"it referred to the instruction on the wall of cincinnatus c’s jail: ‘‘a prisoner’s meekness is a prison’s pride.’’ although i am not particularly fond of nabokov, if i were to choose one of his works to talk about, it would most likely be invitation to a beheading rather than lolita."
52,inmates,"so i picked another quote from the same novel, rule number six for the prisoners: ‘‘it is desirable that the inmates should not have dreams at all.’’ and, thankfully, i could end with something good that rlt had brought to our attention: the uplifting and liberating power of literature."
53,where,"in retrospect, there should have been a postlecture round table where the author would listen to comments from a smaller audience who had read the book with special attention."
54,question,"and i could have taken o√ my hostess’s hat to ask the question that had been on my mind all along: if world literary masterpieces are so entirely universal, what is so remarkable about reading lolita in the city of tehran?"
55,guilt,others would develop a deep sense of guilt.
56,custody,it was as if the image of an entire nation had been placed in my custody.
57,where,where did you get it?’’ he most probably had forgotten the joke he had played on me at lunch altogether.
58,question,"i ignored the question and refreshed his memory: ‘‘do you know where this spoon was made?’’ ‘‘well, the caption says 500 bce iran."
59,war,"you will see, once you put the two incidents together, how i was arriving at a sad and inevitable conclusion: whether i wanted it or not, i had entered a cultural war zone."
60,question,she spent the next half-hour trying to explain to me what signs of the zodiac were amidst my frantic attempts to clarify that that was not my question.
61,pleaded,"finally, exasperated with her own failure to make me understand her point, she pleaded with her son, ‘‘perhaps, you can tell fatemeh what a sign of the zodiac is.’’ he mumbled a few unclear words and quickly suggested that the three of us take a walk in the garden so that we could enjoy the beautiful autumn afternoon before dark."
62,situation,but the situation was rather awkward.
63,where,the beauty of the painting and the possible age of the manuscript were so striking that i quickly closed the book and put it back where i had picked it up.
64,question,"in the brief question and answer following the talk, one iranian american described the day as being the proudest of her life."
65,case,"in the case of present-day iran, the recent nuclear dispute adds immediacy to the sense of threat."
66,poverty,"was it 29  the jasmine, the stars, & the grasshoppers  poverty, a lack of education, personal devotion?"
67,case,"when the baby was born, the family watched her growth in case the fasting had hurt her."
68,where,"only after i lived elsewhere did i realize that my students can learn from the fact that our poets lived outside books and literature classes, that when i was feeling low i would visit the garden where my favorite fourteenthcentury ghazal writer, hafez, was buried instead of drinking or isolating myself."
69,punishment,next she would search her mind for a really bad punishment.
70,question,"i bent over and whispered in her ear, ‘‘maman, do you want me to read you some poetry?’’ i was ready to repeat the question at least three or four times."
71,where,"‘‘where are you, sa¿di?’’ i thought."
72,death,"farrokhzad was in real life the same as she had been in her poetry—bold, imaginative, curious, 33  the eternal forough  full of the urge to live, and certainly not afraid of death."
73,death,"and yet, now that i think about that day, the most amazing part of it was not that a physics teacher considered it important to share the news of a poet’s death with his ﬁfteen-year-old students."
74,death,"the most amazing thing is that when he announced farrokhzad’s death not a single one of us said, ‘‘who is forough farrokhzad?’’ no doubt some of us had read her more extensively than others, but everyone knew who she was."
75,captive,"indeed, this would be an exceptional fairy princess, one whose robust presence did not remain captive to legends."
76,power,"a book celebrating the power of literature, set in contemporary iran, and written by a professor of literature—all of which describe reading lolita in tehran (rlt )—would seem to be the most likely source for reading about an iranian woman poet of farrokhzad’s import."
77,war,neither would the book clarify that living in the immediate aftermath of a revolution and a war might explain the shifting of attention in the 1980s to matters more pressing than literature.
78,war,"i did not buy the book, so i cannot comment on how good the 36  the eternal forough  translation was, but its existence alone indicated an audience eager to read eco’s master work even in the war-stricken iran of the late 1980s."
79,where,the issue here is that a lack of speciﬁcity turns rlt into the dark house where the reader has little choice but to feel his or her way around the elephant that is postrevolutionary iran.
80,where,"he fostered discussion, valued our opinions, and gave us each a gift that we carry to this day: the desire to look for candles no matter where they might be."
81,middle ages,"exasperated by western ‘‘scholarly’’ studies of the reasons for our lagging behind, we know in our guts that something went wrong for muslim civilization to have come crashing down after its glory in the middle ages."
82,guilt,"this decontextualized and ahistorical tale of our ‘‘failure,’’ which always included a healthy dose of shame and self-doubt, has been further seasoned with guilt after 9/11."
83,freed,"apparently, we had had post o≈ces when no one else had; we had minted coins before others had thought of the idea; and cyrus the great had freed the captive jews of babylon, which meant we were genetically puriﬁed of racial prejudice forever."
84,conviction,"what is more, she had the guts to say it out loud with the biting humor that came with conviction."
85,state,"in a poem called ‘‘the bejeweled land’’ she lashed out at the state propaganda machine: o, how comfortable i am in the loving arms of the motherland!"
86,law,"the paciﬁer of the glorious historical past the lullaby of civilization and culture and the rattling noise of the ratchet of law o, how comfortable i am!"
87,state,"in this infantile state of induced ‘‘happiness,’’ the resident of the bejeweled land incidentally recognized everything that was wrong with the 40  the eternal forough  country of the roses and nightingales."
88,guilty,"it is a question that mostly puzzles my western audience but might, in fact, concern those who share my cultural heritage as well, particularly those who nurse a self guilty of backwardness."
89,question,"the question is this: how could a person as complicated and open as farrokhzad be so widely read and appreciated in a country such as iran, a place with centuries of patriarchy, a relatively high rate of illiteracy, and a deeply traditional culture?"
90,notorious,"i talked about everything from the book of the year and our notorious festival of art, jashne honar, to letters and phone calls from the audience."
91,case,in fact i kept a tape recorder under the front seat of my car in case i happened to run into an interesting person to interview.
92,taken,in fact he had taken care to be dressed properly for the occasion.
93,question,what a thoughtless question—of course he had!
94,taken,"living in an undemocratic society, for example, is taken as a sign of inferiority and lack of intelligence."
95,question,no one ever taught them to question things!
96,deprivation,"the saddest part is not degrading two-thirds of the world, but the self-deprivation of the onethird that views itself as too superior to learn from traditional societies."
97,power,the sense of freedom and power was exciting.
98,where,"the chancellor left as soon as the show ended, and i started looking around to ﬁnd out where m. was hiding."
99,question,"despite all my intellectual capacity and ambition, it had never occurred to me to question my aunt’s projection."
100,power,such is the power of accepted tradition in all cultures.
101,power,the traditions di√er but the power remains the same.
102,war,"little did i know that a war would break out between iran and iraq and i would not see my daughter, only eight years old at the time, for another seven years."
103,where,"it very much mattered, now that i had divorced, where i lived, when i came home, and whom i was seen with."
104,disaster,"she was, and still is, the embodiment of the concept of ‘‘being there for you.’’ besides, she could always think clearly no matter what disaster we had to deal with."
105,wall,"when divorce-related frustrations drove me up the wall, i would call minoo to meet."
106,county,"she was now living in orange county, california, and was part of a feminist reading group that met monthly to discuss their latest reading."
107,building,"for the next hour we just held hands and walked around the building in silence, aimless and dizzy with joy."
108,sentence,we could still say to each other in one sentence what we would explain to others in a paragraph.
109,sink,"they could open their eyes to see her for who she was, or close them and sink into their distorted fantasies."
110,abuse,"human sexuality is complicated and detecting its abuse is a challenge, particularly during times that bring shifts in cultural values."
111,abuse,"for example, nassrin, one of the students, remembers a painful incident of abuse at age eleven by a young uncle."
112,crime,"the reader, predisposed to accept the stereotype of the muslim male as a sexual oppressor, is unlikely to question the relevance of this individual crime to the overall bankruptcy attributed to muslim morality."
113,death,"his death, therefore, brought a sadness tinted with fear and uncertainty."
114,guilt,"rlt describes the chanting, breast beating, and crying for taleqani not with reference to their exaggerated expression of grief but as ‘‘the desperate, orgiastic pleasure of this form of public mourning.’’ the crowd’s twisted intention is summed up when the mourning ceremony is depicted as ‘‘the one place where people mingled and touched bodies and shared emotions without restraint or guilt.’’ the reader is told of a ‘‘wild, sexually ﬂavored frenzy in the air’’—‘‘wild,’’ the magical word that captures the crude, primitive, and dangerous all at once (rlt, 90)."
115,seclusion,many scholars of the middle east (themselves of western or eastern origin) have interrupted the romantic image of the oppressed female in seclusion by showing that some women might in fact choose to wear the veil.
116,war,or is this because of the war—we are supposed to see the extremes and the exaggerated?
117,wall,it depicted an entire wall covered with hundreds of little posters of one of the candidates in clerical outﬁt and a single woman passing by rather closer to the camera than the posters and apparently indi√erent to both.
118,law,"yes, women would like to reform electoral law and various other legal codes in iran to get better representation, and, yes, they are still involved in various struggles to improve their lot."
119,case,"what subject could be more interesting than women, and in this case they seemed to have selected a very relevant topic."
120,exercise,"alice has a naturally beautiful body she takes care of well by dancing, exercise, and good eating."
121,guilty,it is our way of coming to terms with di√erences.’’ it is a very interesting observation and her way of saying we are guilty of the same thing ourselves.
122,freedom,"the latest publication in this genre is the almond, ‘‘a semi-autobiographical exploration of sexual freedom’’ that, according to one of our national newspapers, ‘‘has sold 50,000 copies in france since editions plon brought it out last year."
123,repression,"but of course, our forty-something north african author, who goes by the pseudonym nedjma, has a purpose grander and nobler than ‘‘a desire to titillate.’’ as she said in a recent interview, ‘‘by portraying a woman enjoying the pleasures of the ﬂesh,’’ she wanted to both ‘‘celebrate the body as an expression of life and to strike a blow against the centuries-old repression of muslim women.’’ please feel free not to be surprised."
124,abuse,nedjma is not the ﬁrst writer to abuse the sexual intrigue associated with the mistreated eastern woman.
125,taken,"if the newspaper reporter who wrote about the book had taken the trouble to do his homework he would have found numerous arabic works on sex and sexuality, ranging from purely technical and medical guides, to sociopolitical or ethical approaches, to entertaining kama sutras."
126,case,"in the case of native lineage, particularly one not hampered by misplaced sympathies, the odds will improve signiﬁcantly."
127,authority,you are the authority.
128,poverty,"before we catch our breath, she has turned into a sociologist: ‘‘the arab world is like a sick old man, consumed by gangrene, illiteracy, poverty, dictatorships, fundamentalism.’’ then she adds a touch of psychology: ‘‘love is only possible when women realize they are not there to be legally raped and men understand that a woman is 55  the eternal forough  not a slave or an inferior being.’’ and here comes the personally contributed discipline of psychohistory, presumably based on her observations of people in her native north african hometown."
129,conviction,the message can come across unambiguously: muslims’ religious conviction is a big fraud.
130,state,"within the sanctuary, 56  the eternal forough  she takes her readers on a fascinating tour of frozen seasons that come to life with the warmth of love and back to the ‘‘fragrant core of a fertilized egg.’’ the poem opens with the building of the basic structures of the sanctuary, the ‘‘forbidding walls’’ that might at ﬁrst seem to put her in captivity: now forbidding walls rise again in the silent night like plants; guarding the borders of my love’s state."
131,wall,but her approving tone shows that she has built the wall to protect her space.
132,where,"it is the beginning: return with me to that star return with me to that star far away from the frozen seasons of the earth and its ways to measure and understand where no one fears light 57  the eternal forough  but like all signiﬁcant journeys, the main move is to cross the inner borders and access the core of life itself."
133,where,"this is where the glow of life can be detected, because artiﬁcial compartmentalization has not yet prevailed."
134,charge,"the child born here can be jesus, the one who embodied the miracle of life: let me conceive by the moon in the safety of the night let me be ﬁlled by ﬁne raindrops; newly beating hearts by the weight of unborn infants perhaps my love could be the cradle for another jesus  58  3 my uncle the painter  once when my uncle was in charge of the army personnel o≈ce in shiraz of the 1960s, an o≈cer walked into his room and approached the desk with a note from an inﬂuential superior."
135,power,"but this is how i want you to meet my maternal uncle the painter, in his elegant military uniform, completely unimpressed with corrupt power."
136,death,"he was a master of light and shade, but there are no bright days in his landscapes after her death."
137,where,"he cared to know how much leave time they each had left, where they were stationed, and how they were fed and treated during their military service."
138,case,"if that were not the case, it would be an unreal country, an invented place, a fantasy."
139,where,"no matter where i live, and what i do, that star is going to make me smile and ﬁnd my way."
140,conviction,it is not clear why nassrin feels her father’s act of marrying her mother is a betrayal of her and her family as well as his own religious conviction.
141,term,"even then, this person who once taught math and science is not able to di√erentiate between the dishes that he lumps under the term ‘‘french’’ food (rlt, 54)."
142,repression,"for example, nassrin is convinced of her mother’s sexual repression and tells the crowd in the reading group she wishes her mom ‘‘would commit adultery or something’’ (rlt, 54)."
143,situation,"speaking of her father’s family, instead of ‘‘dad,’’ ‘‘grandma,’’ or ‘‘aunt,’’ which a girl in nassrin’s situation would use, she speaks of the man ‘‘whose sisters and mother all wore the chador’’ (rlt, 53)."
144,case,in case the term might be misread— and at times it has been—the muslim scripture makes a clear statement in this particular case.
145,death,the occasion i speak of was a rather large family gathering at which two relatives had started a passionate discussion over the recent death of a dear friend.
146,state,"he had, apparently, been a respected member of the shiraz baha¡i community, the religion that views itself as a natural, perfected, and ﬁnal state of islam."
147,locked,"that day, he must have sensed the confusion that i felt inside, because he said with a smile, as he bent over to o√er me a piece of his peach, ‘‘fortunately, our closet is not large enough to keep god locked up inside.’’ i do not think i understood all of what the joke meant at the time."
148,where,"as i grew older, my poets picked up where my uncle had left o√."
149,where,"it gives men of mr. bahri’s type a level of supremacy that makes loving male family members, teachers, cousins, neighbors, or colleagues invisible, unimaginable to the point that the reader does not even think to ask, ‘‘where are they?’’ the chapter that you are reading, then, is my brief counter-orientalist narration of decent iranian manhood, and it is dedicated to my uncle."
150,war,"a group of christian warriors sought salvation in recovering parts of the kingdom of christ— though christ had never preached war in his life—from the undeserving saracens, who now controlled a good deal of it."
151,killing,"horror stories, ranging from killing and destruction by the crusaders to burning young boys at the stake, were circulating (although, mercifully, no one could read the detailed reports of embedded journalists on-line the next day while the bodies were still warm)."
152,court,"the khan had sent emissaries to the court of khwarazm shah, a king who ruled over territories that are today mostly in northern and central iran."
153,killing,"though this might come as a shock, in the midst of all the killing and turbulence, a good deal of which was fueled by religious di√erence, attar managed to believe that non-muslims were not evil people."
154,inside,god told him to go to a certain obscure temple in anatolia and look inside.
155,situation,"if you display kindness in an antagonistic situation, someone present will give you a smile and a compliment ﬁt for prophets: ‘‘you have come in order to connect.’’ obviously not all iranians or muslims share the openness and clarity of vision that attar and rumi display."
156,building,"like the birds in the story who seek their king (a metaphor for the truth/god), you have to seek the truth during the journey that is your life by building on the smallest moments of manifestation that you personally uncover."
157,building,"so we reward scientists who give us the theoretical foundation for building things, engineers who translate these theories into actual tools, and business specialists who tell us how to sell what has been made."
158,power,"we understand moving forward in terms of the power to open up, unravel, and demystify."
159,death,credible academics are to keep altogether aloof on the subject unless they are interested in dissecting the divine that comes with the express agreement that death has occurred.
160,state,"for in their current state these societies have been disembodied of their treasures, which have been replaced with unrelenting religious fanaticism."
161,power,"‘‘there was such a teasing, playful quality to their words, such joy in the power of language to delight and astonish,’’ the book says of rumi, hafez, and attar."
162,case,"in that case, coming across the mournful announcement of the death of persian literature is, for you, the end of the story."
163,death,i am actually aware of one group particularly vulnerable to the new orientalist declaration of the death of culture and literature in contemporary iran.
164,guilt,the impact of this powerful narrative on most of us is such that the deepened sense of shame and guilt can be felt even in brief social encounters.
165,crimes,we stand a mere inch away from being perceived as accomplices in crimes against humanity.
166,where,"so, as members of the iranian american immigrant community here in the united states, we are not quite sure where to place our modern educated selves in relation to our part-impressive, part-shameful cultural heritage."
167,power,what has given the prayer rug the uncontested power to limit who he can be is the theory of the binary opposition i mentioned.
168,authority,"ghazali wrote with authority on many subjects and taught at the most prestigious university of his time, the nizamieh in baghdad."
169,suspect,"and in the unlikely event that he made the e√ort and understood ghazali, i suspect he would consider the great theologian an exception to his theory."
170,power,i am not suggesting here that ghazali places the power of human rationality above the divine power.
171,where,but that is where the misunderstanding begins: in looking at the two forces in a solely hierarchical relationship.
172,taken,"the interpretation can, in fact, be taken to a further, more radical conclusion."
173,authority,"¿aql, as far as they are concerned, is 76  my uncle the painter  this frowning, conceited authority that knows how to ﬁnd fault with things and whose presence is absolutely necessary."
174,question,a more interesting question is why the suﬁs give ¿ishq such complete supremacy.
175,building,many of the building blocks used to erect the ediﬁce are qur¡anic edicts.
176,state,"the qur¡an also declares that in preeternity god spoke to the seed of adam, the core essence of all our beings, and asked, ‘‘am i your lord?’’ according to muslim scripture, in that state of preexistential existence, we responded, ‘‘yes!’’ suﬁs label this brief exchange the covenant."
177,punishment,"this is not about sin, obedience, or punishment."
178,justice,all sojourners need peace and justice for themselves and others.
179,where,that is where the true di≈culty lies: what we need to remake and piece together is ourselves.
180,where,that is where the emerald of ¿ishq comes in handy to deter the dragon of doubt.
181,authorities,"¿ishq, however, reminded my uncle of the grave powers that come with the glory of a high-ranking position, particularly when the authorities at the top may not always be moving in the direction of your choosing."
182,police,this unrest was manifested at ﬁrst in sporadic confrontations with the shah’s armed forces and secret police.
183,jailed,"while participants in armed struggle were arrested, jailed, or executed, attempts were also made to alleviate the discontent by introducing minor political reform into the system."
184,where,"my uncle and his wife have since moved back to tehran, where their daughter and son live with their own families."
185,stretch,"we both knew that the prophetic attribution was a loving stretch of the imagination, meant to express his admiration and gratitude."
186,thief,"then she turned to both of us rather suddenly, saying, ‘‘no one climbs up my window—not a thief, not a lover!’’ we laughed."
187,state,"her works were among the ﬁrst feminist-conscious enunciations that appeared in the post-revolutionary period in response to limitations imposed on women by the state ideology.’’ it goes on to list other prominent women writers such as ravanipur, behbahani, and danishvar who responded to these limitations with their unmistakable voices, and above all with their lush imaginations and creative energy."
188,state,"i would slightly rephrase the blurb: while parsipur’s writing pushed strongly against the ‘‘limitations imposed on women by the state ideology,’’ the signiﬁcance of her literary contributions transcends that."
189,taken,what kind of a girl has he taken her for?
190,trial,"and yet, the biggest trial women face in the deceptively changing world is not to understand what it is that everyone wants from them."
191,trial,the biggest trial is to remain themselves in the midst of the confusion and the chaos.
192,question,"in women without men, the protagonists have asked and answered that question."
193,power,"the ordinariness they share with each other, and with many women elsewhere in the world, gives them a great power."
194,law,"she risks being killed just so she can at last air her frustration about her sister-in-law, parvin, who has not been appreciative of her kindness and her cooking."
195,law,faizeh’s sister-in-law has accused her of not being a virgin.
196,hole,one thinks the word refers to a sheet and the other to a hole.
197,case,"in this case, ignorance is not the worst problem either."
198,hole,now it turns out to be a hole!
199,authority,"and because the authority in charge here is parsipur, not god or men, munis simply gets up and roams around the streets of tehran as if she had not died."
200,where,"after a month, she is calm, wise, and ready to pick up her life where she left o√."
201,crime,faizeh ﬁnds him with the body and helps cover up the crime.
202,murder,cooperation in murder does not produce the desired outcome.
203,death,"back to the story, faizeh is devastated by the news of amir’s marriage to another woman, and munis returns from her second death, only stronger than before."
204,law,"the ﬁrst thing she tells faizeh is that despite her round face, she was never stupid, and the second is that faizeh should learn to live with her sister-in-law parvin being a better cook than she."
205,war,"he visits iran from time to time and, during the last years of world war ii, brings his wife and two boys with him."
206,war,"then the war ends, and fakhr al-din takes his wife and children and returns to the united states."
207,building,"building on this faulty foundation, rlt adds a number of its own assumptions."
208,state,"at the same time, the book judges the current state of the persian novel (which it does not examine) to be poor and considers the condition to be the literary implication of reality in persian society."
209,where,where do we place them in our perception of democratic societies?
210,case,not in rumi’s case.
211,where,zarrinkulah ﬁnds a local bath where she will be given a private space of her own.
212,inside,"when they open the doors of the shrine in the morning, she does not go inside."
213,inside,she has all the holiness she needs inside her.
214,suspect,"in the café where she eats porridge for breakfast, she is ‘‘a little woman of twenty-six with a heart open like the sea.’’ no one would ever suspect that she once was a prostitute."
215,where,she asks the café owner: —where would one go to ﬁnd cool drinking water so late in the summer?
216,rape,"the women are saying, ‘‘we are here to stay, come oppression, murder or rape."
217,power,"we will pick up the pieces and move on.’’ one of the hideous universal tools used to bend women into obedience has always been the power of the taboo, the disgrace attached to disasters."
218,where,"well, not where parsipur calls the shots."
219,rape,"sure enough, there is a rape scene coming up."
220,case,"the journeys of women to karaj are not described in detail except in the case of munis and faizeh, who are raped by a truck driver and his assistant."
221,inside,i will go for a while then get myself inside a house.
222,inside,then go some more and get myself inside another house.
223,rape,"a prostitute can be holy if she chooses to be, and a woman can leave the painful, violent experience of rape behind and be whole again."
224,assault,so munis and faizeh continue toward karaj in spite of the assault.
225,rape,"he does not ﬁnd out about the rape, survives the truck accident, and, of course, carries on with his own trip to karaj."
226,building,the pond in front of the building is large.
227,building,farrukhlaqa thinks that the building could use a touch-up and maybe some additional rooms because there will be many guests.
228,inside,a tree right inside the house?
229,building,as they go around the house ustuvari tries to overcome his agitation by showing the advantages of the building.
230,wall,"ustuvari comments, ‘‘as you see ma’am, this side of the garden does not have a wall."
231,question,"now he has to answer 98  women without men  the question, ‘‘who is this?’’ well, who is this?"
232,taken,"farrukhlaqa asks why, if this woman is insane, has she not been taken to an asylum?"
233,pleaded,"‘‘no ma’am she isn’t,’’ he explains, ‘‘and i have not cried in twenty years but whenever i see her i can’t stop myself.’’ the family has tried to uproot her, but the tree has pleaded, ‘‘please, please don’t cut me."
234,wall,"‘‘we can plant the tree i was suggesting inside the house and 99  women without men  put a wall around this one to cover the disgrace from view,’’ ustuvari suggests."
235,inside,"back in the house, there is a revolution occurring inside farrukhlaqa."
236,inside,"as the baby grows inside her and munis and the gardener take care of her, zarrinkulah turns more beautiful and translucent by the day."
237,where,"when she gets bored, she takes a trip to tehran, where she accidentally passes by the house of amir, munis’s brother."
238,imprison,"one cannot imprison oneself in the kitchen for ever.’’ then she asks amir innocently, ‘‘you, for example, how long are you going to remain a simple civil servant?"
239,wall,zarrinkulah is hardly visible; the gardener is sitting by the wall mending his shoe.
240,where,then they go to the room where zarrinkulah is sitting in bed with breasts full of milk.
241,building,"on the way back to the building, something unusual happens."
242,serving,"she has always seemed perfect: serving others, having nothing but goodness in her heart."
243,where,"one day the couple hold hands, sit on the lily, and head o√, though to where we do not really know."
244,illegal,"instead, the book takes the rich and complicated story of postrevolutionary iran and reduces it to the image of the blind man whose job was to censor movies and the ten-year-old who felt his dreams were ‘‘illegal’’ (rlt, 46)."
245,taken,"as for iranian women, their life story cannot be so easily ‘‘taken from them,’’ as the book suggests (rlt, 41)."
246,where,i have led you from the summer nights of my childhood in shiraz to the high school where you met my friends zohreh and minoo.
247,building,"and who will deny that bridge building is the thing to do in this age of transnationalism fractured by fear of 109  the good, the missing, and the faceless  terrorist acts and erroneous perceptions of each other?"
248,war,part iii opens with reference to the iran-iraq war beginning in 1980.
249,war,"its literary focus is on james, his personality, and his lobbying americans to enter world war ii in support of britain."
250,executed,"like the rest of the book, this part makes many allusions to the misfortunes of the local population, including a female leftist student named razieh who is executed and an unnamed male student who burns himself to death."
251,camp,the extremists’ perception of the universe as a black-and-white world of inﬁdelity and faith is replicated by rlt ’s oversimpliﬁed world that posits good on the side of the west and evil squarely in the muslim camp.
252,war,"112  the good, the missing, and the faceless  flying airplanes into buildings, keeping prisoners of war out of reach of the law, beheading those who might vaguely sympathize with the ‘‘enemy,’’ setting o√ bombs in subway cars, and dragging the largest army of the world halfway across the globe to ﬁght imaginary weapons of mass destruction are signs of big trouble."
253,where,"ghomi (‘‘from the city of ghom,’’ where major religious seminaries are located) thinks daisy miller is evil and deserves to die (195)."
254,serving,"whether their goals are absolutist and self-serving or not, ‘‘they’’ are unable to attain them."
255,death,"they all lie, even those who come to mourn ayatollah khomeini’s death, since alongside the frenzy of beating chests and fainting they sit on the roadside to eat their sandwiches and drink their soft drinks as if they were on some kind of holiday or picnic."
256,war,"similarly, when iraq attacks and the war starts, the ugly extort ‘‘undeserved privileges from the faculty’’ in the name of war e√orts."
257,executed,"the relatively more acceptable revolutionary student razieh—more acceptable because she is later executed—is full of 114  the good, the missing, and the faceless  anger and hatred."
258,authority,"women although the ugly are all backward, subhuman, and ready to surrender to authority, women in rlt are particularly so."
259,case,"legal reform in areas related to gender is needed, as is also the case regarding the rights of religious minorities and election laws."
260,where,"the young and selfdemeaning revolutionary razieh tells her teacher, ‘‘you must think about where we are coming from."
261,question,"the enigmatic question is, ‘‘how could the book show no awareness of the presence of intelligent, vibrant, and complicated women in that society?’’ an array of exaggerated, tragic events befalls the women featured in rlt."
262,conviction,"if the account of the twelve-yearold girl shot to death as she ran around the prison asking for her mother is true, it will not be the ﬁrst time that ideological conviction overcame humanity (191)."
263,crime,"neither would anyone, even the most hard-line among the revolutionaries, wear that crime as a badge of honor."
264,jail,"we are told that mahtab, razieh’s friend who escaped execution and was released from jail, is worse o√ than her dead friend."
265,disaster,"similarly, when the engagement of sanaz, one of the girls in the reading group, is broken, the incident is given the dimensions of a national disaster."
266,mutilation,"the reader, therefore, moves from disaster to disaster without a mo116  the good, the missing, and the faceless  ment’s relief: compulsory wearing of the veil, seclusion, divorce, physical violence, genital mutilation!"
267,crime,"technically, rlt should not include this particular crime because it has never been practiced in iran."
268,punishment,"we are then told: ‘‘in some perverse way, the physical punishment was a source of satisfaction to her."
269,punishment,"the women, in other words, are turned masochistic by the punishment."
270,abuse,physical and psychological abuse of women is pervasive around the world.
271,abuse,rlt ’s concern over the physical and psychological abuse of women is justiﬁed.
272,pleading,"he calls apologetically and breaks the engagement, ‘‘pleading’’ that ‘‘he would always love her.’’ the author’s comment about the young man is short and clear: ‘‘bloody coward’’ (278)."
273,abuse,"they tell us that these men physically ‘‘abuse,’’ ‘‘dictate’’ their will, ‘‘forbid’’ learning, and ‘‘conﬁscate’’ the women’s possessions, among other things (48, 54, 17, 15)."
274,death,"the ‘‘kid’’ is an honest, brilliant, loving, and courageous baha¡i boy whom we read about because of the death of his grandmother."
275,situation,"still, neither situation is desirable."
276,question,"conversely, a person with secularist tendencies (even my geneticist friend who will not question or reexamine his understanding of religion) can not be an absolutist."
277,taken,the second problem is that studies of life in postrevolutionary iran do not justify excluding the lively gender debates that have taken place in the country among men and women of all backgrounds.
278,authorities,"according to rlt, the myth of islamic feminism was perpetuated by the authorities because it ‘‘enabled the rulers to have their cake and eat it too: they could claim to be progressive and islamic’’ at the same time (262)."
279,law,matters related to islamic law are particularly inaccurate.
280,law,"azin says, ‘‘this guy [president khatami] wants the rule of law?"
281,law,isn’t this the same law that allows my husband to beat me and take my daughter away?’’ (318).
282,court,"currently, physical abuse a√ords legal ground for divorce in iran; and child custody is not automatically given to either parent (except in the case of girls, who remain with their mothers until the age of seven, when the court rules on custody)."
283,court,"i have divorced friends in the united states who cannot leave the state in which they live without informing the court of their move, whereas their exhusbands—even if they were the ones who walked out of the marriage and away from the child—do not have that obligation."
284,case,worse still is the case of a friend who lived for years after her divorce in the horror of harm coming to her young daughter.
285,law,"in iran, too, there are extreme and relaxed approaches to dietary law as well as to other issues."
286,taken,this reductionism is echoed in the words of reading group member yassi: ‘‘our religion has deﬁned every single action we have taken.
287,power,"the islamic regime, which came to power with the 1979 revolution, was a political governing force driven by the totalizing vision of the revolution, focused on establishing its hegemony over a diverse society."
288,authority,"like its counterparts elsewhere, it espoused a purist outlook, su√ered from internal conﬂict, and used far too much force to assert its authority."
289,war,"when the iran-iraq war ended in 1988, ﬁnally a little room was opened for the larger public to put the idea of reform on the agenda."
290,war,"most love their country, respect other people’s beliefs, do not support extremism or war, and love to see a democratic system that respects their culture and tradition continue to develop in iran."
291,power,they complain about the unequal distribution of power in the world.
292,jailed,"when the law of the land prevents certain candidates from competing in the iranian elections, reformists are jailed, and newspapers are closed, these people feel deeply hurt."
293,wall,"they go about living a quiet, humane, honorable life; no one gets to hear about them because they do not write slogans on the wall or attach bombs to themselves."
294,law,"since their group is large, i limit myself to the subjects of literature, cinema, philosophy/social criticism, and law."
295,question,discussing them at length is out of the question here.
296,war,"she has spoken out against war, violence, and oppression of every kind."
297,freedom,"a line of speed and fire, paper dress, and a windowful of freedom are among her latest collections."
298,law,"in the area of law and human rights, nobel laureate shirin ebadi is a person to remember."
299,lawyer,"a lawyer by profession, ebadi was known to iranians for her e√orts to improve the rights of women and children long before she received her nobel prize."
300,crime,"she rose to further prominence due to her willingness to serve in a series of extremely sensitive, high-proﬁle cases of political crime that involved the assassination of iranian intellectuals."
301,murder,"at the same time, she lavished equal attention on a murder case involving a young girl of modest background."
302,where,"he rose to prominence in the west with his 1978 ﬁlm where is the friend’s house, inspired by a poem with the same title by the renowned contemporary iranian poet sohrab sepehri."
303,taken,"karim emami was taken from us by leukemia, the disease that also claimed edward said, one of the greatest minds in twentieth-century social and literary criticism and the ﬁrst to pay critical attention to the phenomenon of orientalism."
304,justice,there is simply not enough room to do them all justice.
305,civil rights,"many of the ﬁgures mentioned here speak up against oppression in an e√ort to improve human and civil rights in iran, but they remain equally critical of the west."
306,jailed,"in the novel invitation to a beheading, which rlt showcases, the jailer invites the jailed protagonist cincinnatus to a dance."
307,jailer,cincinnatus enjoys the attention from the jailer so much that he regrets the ending of the ‘‘friendly embrace’’ when the dance ends.
308,prisoner,"the interpretation given for this is that ‘‘as long as he accepts the sham world the jailers impose upon him, cincinnatus will remain their prisoner and will move within the circles of their creation’’ (76)."
309,jailer,"ironically, rlt has created a world parallel to that of cincinnatus’s jailer for the american reader."
310,jailer,"to get an independent, balanced, and fair perspective on the subjects discussed in the book, the reader needs to stop dancing with the jailer and break out of rlt ’s exaggerated world."
311,question,"they, the americans, have a dream: they feel nostalgic about the promise of the future.’’ before the reader can question the validity of her sweeping characterizations of two entire cultures (one looking forward and one looking back), the memoir bolsters this dichotomy with statements of approval (or coveting) by the natives themselves."
312,executed,"razieh, the marxist student who is later executed, says, ‘‘i don’t know why people who are better o√ always think that those less fortunate than themselves don’t want to have the good things.’’ for razieh these things include good music, good food, and the non-marxist desire to read henry james (221)."
313,case,"responding to accusations of spying for the cia on the part of a certain professor z, the author declares: ‘‘i told him [the accuser] they had no proof that the gentleman in question was a cia agent, and in any case i doubted that the cia would be foolish enough to employ someone like him’’ (119)."
314,crimes,"with no mention of the public disapproval for the incident, we read the caricatured descriptions of picnics outside the occupied embassy amid shouts of ‘‘death to america!’’ the reader is then told, ‘‘a tent was raised on the sidewalk ﬁlled with propaganda against america exposing its crimes around the world’’ (104)."
315,war,"miss ruhi, one of the most ‘‘menacing’’ muslim women activists in rlt, confesses that she has given her daughter a ‘‘secret name.’’ this woman, who has spent the last two decades of her life among any number of revolutionary ﬁgures and iran-iraq war casualties is short of heroes and therefore names her daughter daisy, after daisy miller."
316,where,"(328) if despite the love lavished on america we are not sure exactly where the author’s sympathy lies, rlt provides a hint."
317,taken,"what more could we ask of the guide who has taken us into a hidden, magical world belonging to a totally di√erent other?"
318,felony,"no classic felony is left out (particularly those committed against muslim women): degradation, wife beating, rape, ﬂogging, shooting, molestation, and more."
319,where,"consider the last section on austen, where two and a half pages are lavished on setting up and describing a dance scene."
320,case,"her body quivers as she takes her small steps and dances with her ﬁngers and her hands.’’ in case we forget the innocence and fragility at the core of the sexual transformation taking place in front of us, the commentary adds, ‘‘a special look has appeared on her face."
321,power,"it is daring and beckoning.’’ not so natural or innocent either—it is ‘‘designed to attract, to pull in, but at the same time it retracts and refracts with power.’’ however, this is a power that ‘‘she loses as soon as she stops dancing.’’ her power of sexual allure notwithstanding, sanaz is the same helpless fawn you have been reading about so far (265)."
322,sentence,"in case we consider this a normal dance, and thereby miss the otherness of the performer, the author clariﬁes: ‘‘there are di√erent forms of seduction, and the kind i have witnessed in persian dancers is so unique, such a mixture of subtlety and brazenness, i cannot ﬁnd a western equivalent to compare to it.’’ the next sentence might as well be the portrait in an odalisque painting by an eighteenth-century european artist, torturing his imagination to depict the ‘‘essence’’ of all oriental women regardless of who they are."
323,case,"this seduction is ‘‘elusive.’’ it is ‘‘sinewy’’ and ‘‘tactile.’’ it ‘‘twists, twirls, winds, and unwinds.’’ please do not take this as simple feminine charm; ‘‘it is calculated, it predicts its e√ect before another little step is taken, and then another little step.’’ in case the description is not othering enough, the point is reiterated: ‘‘it is ﬂirtatious in a way miss daisy miller and her likes could never dream of being’’ (266)."
324,captivity,"with each move she [sanaz] seems to free herself from her layers of black cloth.’’ in short, her ‘‘captivity,’’ and struggle to ‘‘free herself ’’ from the robe makes the robe ‘‘diaphanous’’ and adds to the excitement and ‘‘mystery’’ of her dance (266)."
325,war,war is one such topic.
326,war,"the iranians going to war are described as ‘‘very young and caught up in the government propaganda that o√ered them a heroic and adventurous life at the front and encouraged them to join the militia, even against their parents’ wishes’’ (208)."
327,war,"no doubt, a group of young, excited males rushed to the iran-iraq war front in response to promises of a hero’s reward."
328,war,nor would anyone deny there was war propaganda.
329,war,is there ever a war without one?
330,war,there is a war going on right now that the united states is waging against an ‘‘enemy’’ that lives thousands of miles away and was once presumed to own threatening weapons of mass destruction that we now know do not exist.
331,war,as much as many of us loathe war—and as much as we wished at the time that the iran-iraq war would end quickly—it is distressing to see the struggle so badly misrepresented.
332,criminal,"132  the good, the missing, and the faceless  saddam was a criminal who used chemical weapons against innocent people, and he must not be allowed to get away with his invasion."
333,war,does this line of argument ring a bell with regard to the current american war?
334,war,the current american war is not what i wish to discuss here.
335,war,"a mere four pages after we hear expressions of horror regarding the way iranians, young and old, give their lives to the war because they have fallen for the ‘‘government propaganda,’’ we read snippets from henry james’s biography."
336,war,"it is an elegant section, mostly because of the profoundly moving quotes from james about war in general."
337,war,"he says in relation to world war i: ‘‘the war has used up words; they have weakened, they have deteriorated like motor car tires.’’ how right he is."
338,war,"the tenor, the voice, the approach to war is, suddenly, entirely di√erent."
339,war,"‘‘when still very young, james witnessed the civil war in america,’’ the narrating voice tells us, explaining that he was prevented from participating in this war by a mysterious backache."
340,war,"then, there is reference to james’s two younger brothers who ‘‘fought with courage and honor’’ in the war!"
341,justice,"rather, they were honorable human beings who cared about justice and freedom (213)."
342,war,"later, we read about james’s own anguish over world war i raging in europe and his e√orts to lobby on behalf of the british and belgians to get america involved."
343,war,"the quote is taken from a letter that james wrote to clare sheridan, whose husband was killed in world war i."
344,war,it contains a highly sentimental reference to people who are killed in war as ‘‘these admirable beings’’ one must ‘‘honor and celebrate’’ because indeed they are ‘‘our pride and our inspiration’’ (215).
345,war,"‘‘james’s reaction to the war,’’ we are told, has its ‘‘peculiarities.’’ what are these peculiarities?"
346,war,"because james’s ‘‘own country, america, was not at war.’’ this is a rather lame excuse, considering the fact that james had actually lived in england for over forty years and would eventually adopt british citizenship before his death in 1915."
347,war,"in other words, his approval of a war is no more saintly and superior."
348,war,"however, i insist that the same standards of admiration and honor be applied to the many iranians who were no more fond of war yet fought with their lives against saddam’s aggression."
349,war,i overheard two young men who had apparently been to the war front talking.
350,freedom,"perhaps they were not acquainted, because they expressed their fears with the kind of freedom one feels when talking to strangers."
351,war,"i can tell you for sure that neither of them had enjoyed the war, or had looked for heroism, and yet neither had run away—which is why that country is still intact."
352,conviction,"it is time to write with 134  the good, the missing, and the faceless  passion and conviction about the double standards that many of us in the democratic world live with comfortably."
353,war,we are in a war against evil!’’ (195).
354,freedom,"‘‘even in persian ﬁlms,’’ we are told, ‘‘when two people are supposed to be in love, you didn’t really feel it in their looks and gestures.’’ yes, it would be great for iranian ﬁlmmakers to enjoy the freedom they need to make their ﬁlms."
355,camp,all the bad things happen in the camp of the fanatics.
356,authority,"as a personal memoir, the book borrows ﬁrst and foremost the authority of the author’s personal voice."
357,authority,this is a considerable sum of specialized authority.
358,charged,throwing this kind of charged comment at a reader who has a limited context comes very close to misinformation.
359,authority,their voices further enforce the author’s personal authority.
360,authority,even for these readers—perhaps more so in the case of such readers—references to well-known literary ﬁgures lend authority to the book.
361,power,"in these literary critical discussions, the book captures a sense of excitement generated by the transforming power of literature."
362,guard,"elsewhere, mahshid speaks about how things ‘‘were di√erent’’ during the ‘‘shah’s time’’ when she should have been under ten years old, even if we take her reference to the shah’s time to mean the mid-1970s: ‘‘i felt i was in the minority and i had to guard my faith against all odds’’ (327)."
363,custody,azin is going through a divorce and custody battle.
364,custody,"we are told: ‘‘that girl [azin’s daughter] was her whole life, and you know the courts, child custody always went to the father’’ (286)."
365,court,"in iran custody battles are, as elsewhere, di≈cult and unpleasant, but court decisions are not automatic."
366,custody,"when the mother remarries, for example, she does endanger her right to custody."
367,war,"the references to the iran-iraq war are often erroneous, too."
368,war,"we are told of ‘‘constant defeats on the battleground’’ and reminded that ‘‘the war was lost.’’ concerning khomeini’s death, the narrator observes that ‘‘after the defeat in the war and disenchantment, all he could do was die’’ (238, 239, 246)."
369,war,the records of that terrible war are not classiﬁed information.
370,war,talking about an iranian defeat on the battleground is an odd way to describe this war.
371,taken,"at the same time, things that could be taken seriously or lead to respect for the native culture are erased."
372,building,"if you live in an apartment building in tehran, rome, or istanbul, hearing the hubbub in the street is a joyful sound."
373,war,"a shell-shocked muslim student, apparently returning from the war front, burns himself to death."
374,war,but there is little compassion for the young man who might have indeed killed himself out of mental illness resulting from violence he witnessed in the war.
375,war,"we are also told that the student must be one of the ‘‘usurpers’’ of a place in the university, and that he must have come back from the war ﬁnding the revolution in shambles and therefore decided to burn himself."
376,war,"like his other comrades, the torched one has ‘‘turned himself into a revolutionary, a martyr and a war veteran, but,’’ the book argues, ‘‘not an individual.’’ why is he not an individual?"
377,case,"but in the case of the disturbed muslim activist, this is evidence that he was not ‘‘an individual.’’ as the regime’s loudspeakers urge everyone to return to their classes, our narrator tells us of her feeling ‘‘obsessed’’ with the incident and irritated with the muslim activist who has turned himself into a victim, forcing everyone to take a look at his misery."
378,question,it leads to a question about her own irritation and resentment concerning the incident.
379,question,"‘‘had he, by burning himself, usurped our right to revenge?’’ is the question that emerges out of this tragic event (252)."
380,case,"(in fact, the inability to fall in love is indicated as a possible side e√ect of islamic activism in the case of the boy who burnt himself as well: ‘‘did he ever fall in love?’’ the author asks [252].)"
381,inside,"nahvi has written a love letter to mitra, we are told, and sealed it in a ‘‘hideous blue’’ envelope that smells of ‘‘cheap perfume, of rosewater.’’ ‘‘inside the envelope, mitra had found a one-page letter, with the same dreadful color and smell’’ (291)."
382,power,"although he has revolutionary power and inﬂuence, nahvi does not try to use them to gain mitra’s approval."
383,case,"one of the undesirable impacts of the new orientalist narrative, in this case rlt, is keeping us focused on these villains and enforcing the myth that all is well where we live."
384,taken,you will be taken seriously.
385,guantanamo,"she is deeply wounded by the idea of her holy book being ﬂushed down the toilet at guantanamo bay, and even more hurt by the way the media brushes aside the issue of trampling her faith under foot and concentrates instead on whether the method is e√ective in interrogation."
386,freedom,"a  i hope you honor me by keeping the lamp and the window, meeting as many people as you can, and acknowledging that indeed ‘‘genuine democracy cannot exist without the freedom to imagine without any restriction’’ (330)."
387,stretch,"my father, by contrast, was not a saint by any stretch of the imagination."
388,sentences,"we exchanged those two sentences close to a hundred times, i am sure."
389,custody,everything that he had was in his custody temporarily until a more suitable candidate could be found to receive it as a gift.
390,insane,"i remember being told at the age of ﬁve or six, when left with an aunt for a couple of hours, ‘‘please don’t jump on the sofa, and you can keep some of the questions you have for when i come back!’’ i drove people insane with questions, i am told."
391,where,"‘‘i know there is.’’ i changed and left my room to go to the hall where we usually got together; ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner; or entertained informal guests."
392,justice,"as to our house, the word ‘‘old’’ would not do it justice."
393,building,"the building was ancient, two stories, with relatively small rooms and high ceilings and plenty of nooks and crannies to explore."
394,where,"on the way i passed baba’s room, where he would usually be sitting on his bed if not in the hall."
395,pen,"he would be sharpening a new reed pen for calligraphy, doing crossword puzzles, listening to the radio, or reading a book."
396,where,out of where?
397,where,"‘‘thank goodness they are o√ their mother’s milk,’’ he declared with a fairly serious face, ‘‘or they would be dead by now.’’ i asked him to call me if he needed help and returned to the hall, where i was greeted with a steaming cup of tea and the little silver bowl ﬁlled with sugar cubes."
398,wall,"was it baba’s tears, the glittering eyes of the rescued kittens, the hitting of my head against the wall for that long?"
399,power,"he is courageous, good-looking, spoiled, and intoxicated with power."
400,where,"initially, he is brought in to design a passageway to bring milk from where the cattle are kept to shirin’s palace for her breakfast."
401,death,"he sends someone to announce the false news of shirin’s death to farhad, who consequently ends his own life."
402,death,"the love story is a tragedy and ends in the couple’s death; nevertheless, their time together is happy, full of lively and humorous exchanges."
403,power,women’s sexually magnetic power can make men lose their ability to judge and leave them susceptible to committing irreversible errors.
404,taken,"obviously, shirin has taken o√ense."
405,question,"a  the question, ‘‘to whom does shirin belong?’’ is an interesting one."
406,question,it is also a question we do not pose often because its answer seems clear: she belongs to those who lived eight hundred years ago.
407,taken,it would certainly have taken away a good many rounds of evening tea with my father and the saints who visited regularly.
408,where,yet you 157  tea with my father and the saints  know that it has originated in the sea and is on its way back to where it has come from.
409,case,"alternatively, friends and relatives would stop by, in which case we would drink tea and talk with them."
410,sink,"just as feet sink into mud, my feet sank into love.’’ i was too young to understand any of the mystical or literary connotations of these words, but these were just like the words that my singing dervish used in his songs as he passed through the alleyway late at night."
411,sentence,"later, when i learned to write, i wrote the sentence about sinking into love and stuck it on the wall of my room."
412,state,"another time he declared publicly, ‘‘glory be to me, how great is my state!’’ and apparently was thrown out of town for a while 158  tea with my father and the saints  because this was the standard phrase used to glorify god!"
413,thief,"the shopkeeper took one look at his scru√y appearance and said, ‘‘how do i know you haven’t stolen this nice shirt?’’ ‘‘how can i prove it is mine?’’ asked the thief."
414,thief,"it is the thief he is teaching a lesson to.’’ no, i hadn’t realized that."
415,sentences,"he had barely read two more sentences when he paused for the third time and said, ‘‘the person he is really teaching a lesson to is himself, though.’’ one thing was clear, i could not blame myself for not having guessed this one."
416,thief,how could he be teaching himself a lesson by testifying that his own stolen shirt belonged to the thief ?
417,case,"in that case, what could rumi do except tell me?"
418,inside,the same water will sink the boat if it gets inside.
419,inside,"in other words, ownership is about how much you love your things (literally, how much you let them get 160  tea with my father and the saints  inside your heart)."
420,punishment,"he never tried to make things easier than they needed to be, but he never applied guilt, sadness, or punishment to impel people to be good."
421,hanged,"in fact, one of his master metaphors relates to the emotion of sadness: ‘‘that thief,’’ he said, ‘‘has been hanged on my threshold a long time ago.’’ and a thief it is."
422,camp,"i don’t trust you.’’ amu vazin said, ‘‘would you set a trap for me, if i come to your side unarmed?’’ ‘‘of course not,’’ replied the commander, ‘‘we are men of honor.’’ amu vazin responded, ‘‘i trust you,’’ and walked right into the rebels’ camp unarmed and unaccompanied by any soldiers."
423,where,he had looked calm and no one had asked where he had been.

438,cell,"—emily brontë  although this is a work of nonfiction, i have changed names to protect the identities of my cell mates, and i have added the details of other prisoners’ stories to theirs, merging lives and reshaping them."
439,cell,"this has enabled me to safely tell of life and death behind the walls of evin and to remain true to what we went through, without putting anyone in danger or invading anyone’s privacy—but i’m sure my cell mates will easily find themselves here."
440,prisoner,"prisoner of tehran  one  there is an ancient persian proverb that says: “the sky is the same color wherever you go.” but the canadian sky was different from the one i remembered from iran; it was a deeper shade of blue and seemed endless, as if challenging the horizon."

446,prisoners,parisa and i discovered we had been prisoners at the same time in different areas of the same building.
447,cell,"i mentioned the names of a few of my cell mates, but they weren’t familiar to her, and she told me about her prison friends, but i didn’t know them."
448,inmates,"however, we shared memories of certain events which were well known to most evin inmates."
449,captive,this was the very silence that had held me captive for more than twenty years.
450,evin,"when i was released from evin, my family pretended that everything was all right."
451,evin,"no one asked, “what happened to you?” i ached to tell them about my life in evin, but i didn’t know where to start."

458,where,“where have you been?
459,arrested,"if i wasn’t so worried and depressed, i would have loved to spend time with him, but ever since my school friends, sarah and gita and sarah’s brother, sirus, had been arrested and taken to evin prison, i had not been able to function."

463,evin,evin had been a political prison since the time of the shah.
464,torture,the name brought fear to every heart: it equaled torture and death.
465,evin,people never talked about evin; it was shrouded with fearful silence.
466,arrested,"the night sarah and sirus were arrested, i had been lying on my bed, reading a collection of poems by forough farrokhzad when my bedroom door burst open and my mother appeared in the doorway."
467,arrested,“revolutionary guards arrested both sarah and sirus about an hour ago and took them to evin.” i couldn’t feel my body.
468,power,"after the success of the islamic revolution, its members opposed ayatollah khomeini’s unlimited power as the supreme leader of iran and called him a dictator."

470,arrested,"since they had been arrested, i knew i would be next."
471,guard,"my name was on a list of names and addresses my chemistry teacher, khanoom bahman, had spotted in the principal’s office—and our principal, khanoom mahmoodi, was a revolutionary guard."
472,where,where would i go?
473,arrest,"if they went to a house to arrest someone and that person was not home, they would take whoever was there."
474,arrested,"during the past few months hundreds of people had been arrested, accused of opposing the government in one way or another."
475,where,"“you stay here with them while i search the apartment,” the second guard said to his friend and then turned to me and asked, “where’s your room?” his breath smelled of onions and made my stomach turn."
476,death,i had not seen him cry since my grandmother’s death.
477,guard,"the other guard soon came back with a handful of my books, all western novels."
478,arrest,"“are these yours?” “yes.” “we’ll take a few of them as evidence.” “evidence of what?” “of your activities against the islamic government.” “i don’t agree with the government, but i haven’t done anything against it.” “i’m not here to decide whether you’re guilty or not; i’m here to arrest you."
479,where,“put on a scarf and let’s go.” “where are you taking her?” my mother asked.
480,evin,"“to evin,” they answered."
481,guard,what’s that?” said the guard.
482,evin,praying is exactly what you need to do in evin.” i dropped the rosary in my pocket.
483,question,“it’s in your best interest to answer every question you’re asked truthfully or you’ll pay for it.
484,evin,"you’ve probably heard that at evin, they have their ways of making people talk."
485,evin,"after about half an hour, in the pale moonlight, i saw the snakelike walls of evin zigzagging across the hills."
486,guard,he was very glad that the groom was a high-ranked revolutionary guard and from a well-todo traditional family.
487,gate,we neared a large metal gate and came to a stop in front of it.
488,wall,the barbed wire covering the top of the wall cast a tangled shadow on the pavement.
489,guard,"the driver stepped out, and the guard sitting in the front passenger seat gave me a thick strip of cloth and told me to blindfold myself."

491,tortured,maybe she had been tortured.
492,evin,bravery is a rare quality in evin.
493,tortured,he was probably a revolutionary guard and a violent man who tortured and killed innocents without remorse.
494,evin,maybe i was the only christian he had ever seen in evin.
495,where,maybe this was a place beyond fear where all normal human emotions suffocated without the luxury of even a struggle.
496,torture,"i waited, thinking they had no reason to torture me."
497,torture,torture was usually used to extract information.
498,case,"ali explained that he worked for the sixth division of the courts of islamic revolution, which was investigating my case."
499,crime,this was not a secret or a crime.
500,illegal,he knew about the strike i had started at school and believed that it was impossible for an individual without any connections with illegal political parties to organize a strike.
501,where,"“i don’t know where you get your information,” i said, “but it’s completely wrong."
502,arrest,"if i give you names, you’ll arrest them."
503,arrest,"i don’t want that to happen.” “yes, we’ll arrest them to make sure they aren’t doing anything against the government, and if they aren’t, we’ll let them go."
504,interrogation,"“i can’t help you, because i don’t know where she is.” he had remained calm during the interrogation and had never raised his voice."
505,cell,"heavy, deep, and desperate, they penetrated my skin, spreading into every cell of my body."
506,where,"will you give us the names?” “no.” “what i really want you to tell me is where shahrzad is.” “i don’t know where she is.” “ali, look; she has such small wrists!"
507,situation,"a scream escaped my throat, but i didn’t struggle, knowing that my situation was hopeless and would only worsen if i put up a fight."
508,inside,it exploded inside me like a bolt of lightning.
509,where,“where is shahrzad?” i would have told if i knew.
510,where,“where is shahrzad?” “i really don’t know!” agony.
511,inside,"my feet ached, but the agonizing pain was gone, replaced by a soothing emptiness that spread inside my veins."
512,executed,you could easily be executed for not cooperating with the government.
513,torture,"he said that my cooperation would change nothing for any of my friends, but it would save me from torture."
514,arrested,"he said that my friends would be arrested whether i talked or not, but if i wrote down their names, i wouldn’t have to suffer any longer."

518,toilet,"when he took off the blindfold, we were in a very small room with no windows and a toilet and a sink in the corner."
519,cell,"the doctor gave me some kind of injection in the arm, and he and ali left the cell."
520,inside,this was the only time of day when i could wander inside my mother’s beauty salon; i could walk between the styling chairs and hair dryers without making her angry.
521,wall,"a gauzy, golden light poured in through the room’s only window, which covered more than half the southern wall."
522,inside,"the light reflected off the white ceiling and spread inside the ashtray’s sparkling, transparent body."
523,wall,"although i couldn’t see my mother, i could hear the sound of her rubber slippers against the linoleum floor; their angry rhythm made me squeeze closer to the wall."
524,wall,she wore a black skirt and a perfectly ironed white blouse and stared straight ahead at the wall.
525,inside,"on our way back, we saw agha taghi, the old man who walked the streets at around this time every year and yelled out: “i card camel wool and cotton!” women opened their windows and asked him to go inside their houses to prepare their duvets for winter by combing the wool or the cotton fibres inside them."
526,wall,"our two-burner oil stove was on the left, the white fridge on the right, and the dish cabinet stood against the wall opposite the door."
527,where,"where is the frying pan?” from the other side of the cabinet, pots and pans spilled onto the floor."
528,where,i rushed to help grandma put them where they belonged.
529,where,"i walked down the dark hallway opposite my mother’s beauty salon and to my father’s dance studio, which was a large l-shaped room with brown linoleum floors where pictures of elegantly dressed dancing couples hung on the walls."
530,war,"then, when you need to cry and don’t want anyone to know you’re crying, you can just chop onions.” “you’re not really crying, are you?” “no, of course not.” when my parents married, during the second world war, they rented a modest apartment at the northwest corner of the intersection of shah and rahzi avenues in downtown tehran, the capital of iran and its largest city."
531,war,"since many american and british soldiers passed through iran during the war, western culture became popular among the higher class, so my father found many faithful students who wished to learn to dance like westerners."
532,state,"there was something terribly sad and lonely about these statues; they looked real but were perpetually frozen into a dark, solid state, unable to break free."
533,police,"my grandmother used to send tamara nice clothes, soap, and toothpaste because those things are hard to find there, until she received a letter from savak, the shah’s secret police, saying that she was not allowed to communicate with anyone in the soviet union."
534,police,"“the police here believe that russia is a bad country, so they told us that we weren’t allowed to write to tamara or to send anything for her.” as i was trying to understand this new information about an aunt i had never known, grandma went on as if talking to herself."
535,sentences,"she mentioned names of people and places i had never heard of before and used words that were strange and unfamiliar to me, so i could only grasp bits and pieces of her sentences."
536,death,"i knew that good people went to heaven when they died, so death couldn’t be too bad—but it still terrified me."
537,where,it was like walking into absolute darkness where every terrible thing could happen to you.
538,death,"her words about blood, violence, and death had shocked me."
539,wall,she told me to look carefully at a painting that had been hanging on a wall in her bedroom since i could remember.
540,death,"you have to know that death is only a step we have to take to reach the other world and live, only in a different way.” “i don’t want anything to change; i like things the way they are.”  “you have to be brave, marina.” i didn’t want to be brave."
541,inside,inside it was a golden box.
542,inside,inside the left shoe was a small golden key.
543,killing,liver cancer was killing her.
544,death,"as days went by, i fought my tears, afraid that they would confirm her death and bring it closer."
545,death,"i needed to say something to her, but i wasn’t sure if she could hear me, if the barrier that death had created between us was penetrable at all."
546,taken,"the next day, grandma’s body was taken away."
547,death,"holy mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.” the covers were lifted from the side of my bed, and a wave of light poured into the darkness of my hiding spot."
548,where,"i leaned against his chest, feeling as if i knew him, as if we had met before, but where or when, i didn’t know."
549,where,“there’s no need for slippers where i come from.” “are you my guardian angel?” “who do you think i am?” i looked at him for a moment.
550,death,“you are my guardian angel.” “you’re right.” “what’s your name?” “i’m the angel of death.” my heart almost stopped.
551,death,"“death is sometimes difficult, but it’s not bad or scary."
552,cell,"i remembered that ali had left me in a cell, but i had no idea how long i had been there."
553,arrest,"“you’re coming with me to watch us arrest your friends,” hamehd said, “the ones you tried to protect."
554,building,"a high-rise condo building stood on one of the hills, surrounded by two-story houses and large bungalows."
555,wall,every single wall was covered with the islamic government’s slogans and khomeini’s quotes.
556,murder,"if one kills the infidel, and this stops him from perpetrating his misdeeds, his death will be a blessing to him.” yes, in khomeini’s world, murder could be considered a good deed, a “blessing.” so hamehd could put a gun to my head, pull the trigger, and believe that he had done me a favor and that he himself would go to heaven because of it."
557,inside,"at an intersection, a young man looked inside our car and, noticing the guard behind the wheel, took a step back and stared at me."
558,arrest,"“we won’t be able to arrest them all tonight, but we should have them in three days or so,” hamehd said with a smile."
559,arrested,hamehd told minoo that i had been arrested a couple of days earlier.
560,arrested,four of my schoolmates were arrested that night.
561,interrogation,i tried to whisper to minoo that she should give the guards a few names during her interrogation.
562,building,"i limped after him into a building, and he told me to sit on the floor in the hallway."
563,prisoners,"i sat there for a long time, listening to the prisoners’ cries and screams."
564,wall,"i managed to find my balance, leaning against the wall for support."
565,where,where are they taking me?
566,death,"a few snowflakes floated lightly in the air, trying to prolong their crystalline flight before facing an earthly death."
567,prisoners,there were four other prisoners with me: two girls and two young men.
568,executed,we were about to be executed.
569,inside,the cold feeling inside my chest paralyzed me.
570,death,this is the moment of my death.
571,prisoners,one of the two male prisoners began to recite in arabic a part of the koran that asked god for forgiveness.
572,death,ready!” death is only a place i’ve never been.
573,where,"“where are you taking me?” “it’s okay; i won’t hurt you,” he whispered."
574,cell,"we were in a small cell, and i was lying on the floor."
575,sentence,"he said he had gone to ayatollah khomeini, who was a close friend of his father’s, to have my sentence reduced from death to life in prison."
576,cell,"i could feel a scream forming in my throat, but he turned around and left the cell."
577,taken,why had he taken me away from the firing squad?
578,arrested,all i could do was to pray for both of us and for sirus and gita and all my friends who had been arrested.
579,prisoners,now we were political prisoners.
580,building,"the old school building was originally a two-story mansion, and my friends had told me that the principal, khanoom mortazavi, who had gone to university abroad, had turned it into a school once she had returned to iran."
581,inside,"although every classroom had tall windows, because of a few ancient maple trees that grew in the yard, it was always dark inside, and we usually had to turn on the lights in order to be able to see the blackboard."
582,building,"in front of our apartment stood a fifteen-story office building with large, mirrored windows sparkling in the sun, reflecting the movement of the clouds."
583,punishment,"one day, i decided that any punishment was better than being locked up on the balcony."
584,locked,"i could scream, but i didn’t want to make a scene and let the whole neighborhood know how my mother locked me on the balcony."
585,inside,then i could tell them about the clothespins and beg them to ring the doorbell and ask my mother to let me inside.
586,confinement,"i knew that my mother would get angry, but i didn’t care; i couldn’t bear my solitary confinement any longer."
587,locked,"i didn’t mean to hurt you, but my mother locked me up here on the balcony, and i want to go inside."
588,death,"not too long after grandma’s death, he had closed down his dance studio and had found a job at a division of the ministry of arts and culture, working with folklore dance groups."
589,where,"i took a step back, calling, “where are you?” right in front of me, a gray shadow came into focus."
590,where,"at the beginning of the school year, sarah had asked me where i had bought the box, and i had told her that my mother had bought it at the big department store at the intersection of shah and pahlavi avenues."
591,where,"after school, it took sarah and me less than five minutes to run to her house, which was on a narrow residential crescent where all houses had small yards and were surrounded by tall brick walls to provide privacy for the residents."
592,building,the high ceilings and many windows of the school’s forty-year-old main building made it feel very spacious.
593,building,"we had a separate gym building with basketball and volleyball courts, and tall brick walls surrounded the paved schoolyard."
594,where,"albert had read all the hundreds of books that were piled up in his store, knew exactly where each one of them was located, and loved to talk about them."
595,where,“where are the books?” i asked him.
596,death,moving to america felt as splitting and eternal as death.
597,cell,the cell slowly came into focus.
598,evin,"he sat on the floor about two or three feet away from me and said he was going to send me to a women’s dorm in evin, named 246, where i would see a few of my friends and would feel better."
599,charge,he said he knew one of the guards in charge of 246 and would ask her to look after me.
600,sentence,had he really told me that i had a life sentence or had i dreamt it?
601,sentence,“do i really have a life sentence?” i asked.
602,execution,i wanted to ask him why he had saved me from execution.
603,sentence,i wanted to tell him that death was better than a life sentence.
604,where,"after a few hours, he came back and took me to the door of a small room where about twenty girls were sleeping side by side on the floor."
605,wall,"there wasn’t enough space to lie down, so i sat, folded my knees to my chest, leaned against the wall, and cried."
606,where,“all the people i’ve called pull their blindfolds up just a little so they can see where they’re going and line up in front of the door here.
607,building,"we entered a building, followed a hallway, and climbed a couple of flights of stairs."
608,guard,"then the guard told us to stop, called my name, and told me to step out of the line."
609,building,"“brother ali has told me about you.” she explained that the building we were in, 246, had two floors, the first floor with six rooms and the second with seven."
610,prisoner,she was a prisoner and the representative of room 7.
611,building,"i guessed that since 246 was a women’s building, we didn’t have to wear the hejab all the time."
612,wall,"a little above my eye level, a metal shelf ran across the wall; plastic bags filled with clothes sat on top of it and smaller bags hung from hooks beneath it."
613,evin,"she said since she had been in evin, she had not seen anyone with their name written on their forehead."
614,where,i asked her if she knew where sirus was and if he was all right.
615,arrested,"the night they had been arrested, the guards had made sarah watch as they lashed sirus."
616,tortured,"they told sirus that if he gave them the names, they would not lash sarah, but he didn’t say a word, and sarah was tortured as well."
617,tortured,it was hard for her to believe that the guards had tortured us for what they already knew.
618,tortured,"“before he tortured me, brother hamehd said that gita had given him my name and address."
619,arrested,i thought it was her fault that i had been arrested.
620,executed,"“just before he sent me here, hamehd told me that gita was executed the night before."
621,where,"seven  the year i was born, my parents bought a cottage in the small town of ghazian—across a bridge from bandar-eh pahlavi—by the caspian sea, where life was slow and green."
622,wall,"here, the road turned north toward the alborz  mountains, which seemed like an imposing sheer wall, separating the deserts of central iran from the caspian sea."
623,where,it followed the valley of the white river to where thick forests covered the hills and the wind carried the fragrance of rice fields.
624,building,the building always greeted us with a familiar damp scent that had saturated the stale air during the months of our absence.
625,where,"there was a special place on the property where, as my grandmother had taught me, i said the our father every morning."
626,where,"once useful as a place where fishermen tied their boats, it looked strange and out  of place when i discovered it in a forgotten corner of the property."
627,where,"i loved to stand on it, open my arms to the gentle breeze, close my eyes, and imagine the sea surrounding me, its glassy surface moving and living, transforming the sunlight into a golden liquid that glided toward the shore where sand hills were like blisters on the hot skin of the earth."
628,building,"for years, i spent my days at the cottage biking, building sand castles, swimming, chasing ducks, and playing with local kids."

639,inside,"a minute later, neda came out, called my name, and asked me to go inside; she was going to cut her cake."
640,taken,"blue hydrangeas and pink roses had taken over the white walls of the cottage, and the silver-green branches of an enormous weeping willow brushed against the red shingles covering its roof."
641,where,"i followed him to his room, where he took a silver flute out of a long, black box and ran his fingers along the body of the sleek instrument."
642,wall,i sat on his bed and leaned against the wall.
643,where,where were you hiding?” he told me that he was not as outgoing as his brother and preferred to read a book or play his flute.
644,death,"my parents spoke russian at home, but since grandma’s death, i had refused to use it, because i believed it was something special my grandmother and i had shared and i didn’t want to share it with anyone else."

646,question,my question had surprised him.
647,authority,"he read them with authority, as if they were his, as if he had composed every word like a perfect melody."

651,guilty,"we have to wait.”  “are you saying that you love me?” “yes, i love you.” i couldn’t exactly understand why he felt guilty about our kiss, but i knew it had something to do with his religious beliefs."
652,where,“yes.” “where?” my mother rarely asked me where i was going.
653,ordered,"“sit down,” she ordered, her eyes examining me from head to toe."

665,where,"“aram, where is he?” i asked as calmly as i could."
666,where,"his parents had called everyone, but no one knew where he was."
667,evin,"his father had even gone to evin, but they had not been able to find him."
668,prisoners,"“they do terrible things to political prisoners, things that just hearing them makes you sick.” i pushed the thought away and made aram promise to call me as soon as he heard anything."
669,where,"i didn’t mean to get into his personal things, but i had to look around to see if there were any clues about where he was,” aram said, giving me a sheet of paper."
670,building,"eight  “it’s our building’s turn to have warm water tonight,” sarah told me."
671,charge,sarah introduced me to the girl who was in charge of “beds.” each of us received three blankets.
672,prisoners,"during the time of the shah, 246, upstairs and downstairs combined, had fifty or so prisoners in total."
673,where,"at first, i was disoriented and didn’t know where i was."
674,evin,this was  evin.
675,arrested,"i had lost loved ones, and i had been arrested and tortured, but on that night, i had traveled too far."
676,death,maybe this was the line that separated life and death.
677,sentence,"and i didn’t want to tell her about my life sentence, because it would only distress her."
678,evin,were they really going to keep me in evin forever?
679,prisoners,she had heard that camphor stopped female prisoners from menstruating; most girls didn’t get their periods at all.
680,interrogation,this usually only happened if we had to go for further interrogation or for visitations.
681,arrest,"one day, about ten days after my arrest, i sat in a corner of the room and watched the girls say their midday prayers."
682,injustice,arash was good and kind; he would never have accepted such injustice.
683,evin,"maybe, we would both have ended up in evin."
684,arrested,"“i was thinking.” “about what?” “about a friend.” i asked her why she had been arrested, and her answer was “long story.” “well, it seems like we have a lot of time on our hands,” i said."
685,sentenced,"sarah had told me that two girls from our room were sentenced to be executed, but taraneh was not one of them."
686,executed,"please don’t tell anyone.” “why did you tell me?” “you were supposed to be executed, weren’t you?” my heart sank."
687,taken,i collected all my strength and told her about the night of the executions and how ali had taken me away at the last moment.
688,executed,"men are not supposed to touch women unless they’re married.” “no!” “this is strange.” “what?” “i’ve heard things.” “what things?” “a couple of girls told me they were raped, and they were threatened that if they told anyone about it, they would be executed.” i only had a vague idea of what being raped meant."
689,execution,“how about before they took you for execution?
690,sentence,“how did you know about my death sentence?” i asked.
691,arrested,"“after i was arrested, they beat me on and off for two days, but i didn’t cooperate,” she said."
692,executed,they  had been executed…ten or twelve people.
693,sentenced,"she was about twenty years old and had been sentenced to death, but her execution had been postponed, because it was against the laws of islam to execute a pregnant or breast-feeding woman."
694,execution,her husband was also awaiting execution.
695,taken,sister maryam said that sarah had to be taken to the prison hospital so she wouldn’t hurt herself.
696,justice,"the shah replaced one prime minister with another, trying to gain control of the country; he gave speeches and told the people that he had heard their cry for justice and was going to make changes."
697,death,"every once in a while, groups of ten to twenty men appeared, set tires on fire, and wrote “death to the shah” and “long live khomeini” on walls, leaving the air thick with smoke and the stench of burning rubber."
698,confinement,"aram was paranoid about my being on the streets; he hardly ever stepped out of his house and had begged me to stay home, but i had explained to him that the boredom of confinement would probably kill me before anything else."
699,where,"“then i’ll come and look for you.”  “where?” his eyes filled with hurt, and i realized how cruel i had been."
700,taken,"unlike my parents, hers were in favor of the revolution and had attended a few rallies but had never taken sarah and sirus along."
701,building,"i begged sarah not to go, reminding her of arash’s disappearance, but she said people had to stop being afraid, and they had to fight the shah who had used our country’s oil money to increase his personal wealth, building palaces, giving lavish parties, and putting enormous amounts of money into his personal accounts in foreign countries."
702,imprisoned,and he had imprisoned and tortured the ones who had criticized him.
703,thief,"the shah is a thief and a murderer, and we have to get rid of him.” one day, a group of people screaming “down with the shah” broke into the small restaurant below our apartment."
704,taken,they had not taken the islamic movement too seriously and believed that this was only a period of unrest and not a revolution and that the shah was too powerful to be overcome by a bunch of mullahs and clergymen.
705,prisoners,political prisoners were released.
706,taken,emergency military governments had taken over most cities and military curfews were still in effect.
707,arrested,"soon armed revolutionary guards and members of islamic committees were everywhere, looking suspiciously at everyone, and hundreds of people were arrested, accused of having been members of savak, the shah’s secret police."
708,imprisoned,"they were imprisoned and their belongings were seized; some were executed, beginning with the top-ranking officials of the old regime who had not left the country."
709,illegal,"not too long after the revolution, dancing was declared evil and illegal, and my father lost his job at the ministry of arts and culture."
710,executed,we heard she had been executed.
711,guard,"to make matters worse, our new principal, khanoom mahmoodi, was a nineteenyear-old revolutionary guard, a fanatic young woman wearing the complete islamic hejab."
712,freedom,"for a few months after the revolution, there was still some freedom of speech."
713,illegal,"there was also the mojahedin-e khalgh organization, which means “god’s fighters for the people.” all these political groups had been illegal at the time of the shah but had existed underground for many years."
714,justice,they were muslim socialists who believed islam could lead iran to social justice and free it from westernization.
715,evin,"however, they were not khomeini’s followers; years before ayatollah khomeini became well known, they had already led many protests against the shah, and their members, who were mostly university students, were tortured and executed in evin."
716,guard,"he asked me about my school, and i told him that our new principal was a revolutionary guard and that i wouldn’t have been surprised to hear she carried a gun in her pocket."
717,arrest,"then, sooner or later, they’ll arrest anyone who’s done anything against the government.” aunt zenia had called me a few days earlier and told me the exact same thing."
718,justice,"they wanted justice for everyone and a society where riches were divided equally, but their ways had proven flawed in the real world."
719,death,"although i knew very well that arash was dead, i still couldn’t think of that day as the day of his death; it was the day of his disappearance."
720,situation,"we first went to a receptionist, a middle-aged woman, and explained our situation."
721,where,"he took us to a large room filled with different kinds of equipment where we told our story to a man in his late forties named aghayeh rezaii, who promised us to find the tape."
722,death,"his eyes were blank and absent, as he, like me, tried to understand the devastating, lonely gap that death had left behind, the terrible falling from the known into the unknown and the terrifying wait to hit the solid  ground and shatter into small, insignificant pieces."
723,death,"after eight months of suffering, we had to face the reality of his death."
724,wall,almost every wall was covered with harsh slogans that promoted hatred.
725,where,i didn’t know exactly where it was.
726,taken,"my parents had not taken me to her funeral, and they had never taken me to visit her grave."
727,death,i went from one to the other and tried to read the names  and the dates of birth and death.

729,where,they deserved to know where he was buried—and he deserved to have a proper grave.
730,death,a year had passed since his death.
731,where,i watched the news coverage of the demonstrations on television and wondered where this angry mob had come from.

735,prisoners,"the sisters called prisoners’ names alphabetically, usually fifteen names at a time, over the loudspeaker."
736,arrested,taraneh had been arrested more than two months earlier but had not had any visitations yet.
737,building,"we walked to the visitation building and, before entering it, were told to take off our blindfolds."
738,evin,she must have bought the outfit for the sole purpose of coming to evin.
739,arrested,all the manteaus she had owned before i was arrested were shorter—about an inch below her knees—and her scarves were smaller.
740,sentence,i could never tell my parents i had a life sentence.
741,guard,“yes.” “she’s okay?” “yes.” “time is up!” a guard yelled.
742,evin,"sitting in our lonely corners, we tried not to think of how our lives used to be before evin, but it was hopeless, because memories were all we had."
743,sentence,"i thought about how ali had managed to reduce my sentence, and maybe, he could do the same thing for taraneh; maybe he could help sarah as well."
744,cell,"and when ali took me to the cell, i remembered the look in his eyes."
745,war,"he’s at the front, fighting the iraqis.” iran had been in war with iraq since september 1980."

750,evin,"most of the girls said the living conditions in ghezel hessar were slightly better than evin, so the ones leaving were rather happy."
751,war,"as frequently as once a week, military marches played through the loudspeakers, and it was announced that the army had won major battles and our troops were about to gloriously end the war with iraq, but none of us really cared much about the war; not only because it had not touched tehran directly, but because evin felt like another planet, a strange world with incomprehensible rules that could condemn any of us to torture or death without any reason."
752,where,"“sarah, where were you?"
753,pen,"they don’t know.” she took a black pen out of her pocket, pulled up her left sleeve, and began writing on her wrist: “sirus is dead."
754,where,"sarah, where were you?” “i’m running out of room."
755,situation,"i didn’t want to make a promise unless i was sure i could keep it, so i went to the office and explained the situation to sister maryam."
756,where,“where am i going?” i asked.
757,building,i’m sure he just wants to see how you’re doing.” i put on my blindfold and followed another one of the sisters to the other building.
758,torture,"there was a torture bed in the corner, a desk, and two chairs."
759,torture,"you killed them.” there were bloodstains on the torture bed, and i couldn’t take my eyes off them."
760,sentence,"“you know that your sentence is life in prison, don’t you?” “yes, i do.”  if he lashes me, he won’t stop until i’m dead."
761,sentence,i’m starting to believe that a life sentence might be better for you after all.
762,where,"“i’m fine.” “put on your blindfold and let’s go.” he left me at the office of 246, where sister maryam told me to take off my blindfold as soon as i arrived."

770,prisoners,"two or three days later, it was announced over the loudspeaker that all the prisoners of the second floor of 246 were to put on their hejab and gather in the yard."
771,building,"four armed, male revolutionary guards walked out of the building, escorting two girls."

778,building,"for about an hour a day, we could use the small courtyard that was surrounded by the building."
779,where,"it reminded us of the other place where we once used to live, where our homes were, and where we belonged."
780,wall,i usually sat by the wall with taraneh.
781,where,"imagining that we sat on a cloud and could steer it in any direction, we told each other about all the familiar places we could see from up there: the streets of our neighborhoods, our schools, and our homes, where our mothers looked out the windows and wondered about their daughters who had been taken away."
782,building,"at that moment, my world was like a roofless square building with two levels of barred windows that looked inside dark rooms, a world of young women walking in circles."
783,imprisoned,it was like a very strange science fiction story: “the planet of imprisoned girls.” i laughed.
784,imprisoned,"before the success of the revolution, he had participated in the anti-shah movement for many years, had been imprisoned twice, and had then managed to flee to france and join ayatollah khomeini."

788,escaped,"now go do your homework.” i went to my room and closed the door behind me, surprised to have escaped her anger so easily."

798,war,i had read about the first and second world wars and the american civil war.

800,war,she explained to me that the radio was urging people to take precautions while promising that this war was not going to last more than a few days or weeks at the most and that our army was going to defeat the iraqis in no time.
801,war,this was the war of good against evil.
802,arrest,"however, every day, people who had paid great sums of money to human smugglers left iran to avoid military service or to escape arrest by the revolutionary guards."
803,criminals,"at ferdosi square, holding a loudspeaker in front of her mouth, a young woman told the crowd about the violent attacks of the hezbollah on women: “how long are we going to allow criminals and murderers hiding behind the name of god to attack our mothers, sisters, and friends and get away with it?” she asked."
804,evin,"in the middle of the bristol board, there was a picture of a young girl with a big smile on her face and under the picture it said: “executed in evin.” suddenly, the street was filled with loud, thunderlike roars."

806,locked,"when i got home, i locked myself in the bathroom."
807,death,i wished i had been shot to death.
808,death,death in a jar.

810,death,i couldn’t hide; death was not a hiding place.
811,wall,"i taped the bristol board to a wall in one of the hallways and stood in front of it, pretending to read it."

813,war,"since the war with iraq had started, the islamic regime had blamed everything on it."
814,war,"in tehran, the war felt distant; now, the sirens hardly ever sounded, and even if they did, nothing happened."
815,war,"at mosques, through loudspeakers, mullahs yelled and screamed that the war was not only about protecting iran but it was about islam; saddam was not a true muslim but he was a follower of the devil."
816,illegal,"slowly, almost everything i loved became illegal."
817,case,"getting religion marks from church sounded like a practical and fair idea, but not in my case."
818,building,the church office and the priests’ residence were in a separate building adjacent to the church.

825,building,"“he’s asked for you.” i put on my blindfold and followed her to another building, where i waited in the hallway."
826,torture,"we were in a windowless room, and there were no torture beds."
827,war,he told me he had spent four months at the war front fighting the iraqis but had to come back when he was shot in the leg.
828,evin,he told me that his main reason for leaving evin had been to stay away from me.
829,execution,he knew that my name was on the execution list and that hamehd didn’t like me.
830,charges,"the ayatollah told him that the charges against me were serious enough to put me on death row, but he kept pleading with him."
831,sentence,the ayatollah finally agreed to reduce my sentence to life in prison.
832,execution,"ali rushed back to evin and asked the guards where i was, and they told him hamehd had taken me for execution."
833,inside,i felt a sense of panic rise inside me.
834,where,he said he had done some research and knew exactly who andre was and where he lived.
835,arrest,"maybe they had been watching me before my arrest, and this was how they knew about andre."
836,torture,“maybe on a torture bed?
837,arrested,you have to accept the fact that your life completely changed when you were arrested.
838,death,he told me maybe i had forgotten that he had saved me from certain death.
839,death,my death would solve many problems.
840,executed,"and just to be on the safe side, i promise you that if you put yourself in harm’s way on purpose, i’ll have your andre executed."

846,crime,holding hands is not a crime.
847,death,i explained to him that my grandmother had written her life story and that she had given it to me before her death.
848,where,"we had to push their leaves out of our way in order to be able to follow her into the living room, where a colorful parrot sat on a perch, a couple of canaries sang in a cage, and a black cat rubbed herself  against my legs."
849,wall,"the air smelled of wet soil, and every wall in the room was covered with bookcases overflowing with books."
850,where,“where is the text?” she asked me as we were sitting down.
851,poverty,he wanted russia to become greater than it was and he wanted poverty to disappear.
852,where,"once in iran, the family first went to the city of mashad, where my father was born, and then to the city of rasht, where esah had a few relatives."
853,war,"after the beginning of the second world war, he asked her to marry him, and she accepted, but they never had a chance."
854,war,all hungarians who lived in iran became prisoners of war and were sent to special camps in india.
855,imprisonment,"although the hejab was mandatory and not wearing it could result in lashing and imprisonment, women could wear what they wanted underneath the hejab."
856,where,"i asked him where he was originally from, and he told me both his parents were from hungary, but he and his sister were born in tehran."
857,arrested,it was a mistake to try to escape through narrow streets; the possibility of being arrested or beaten was much stronger there.
858,prisoner,she explained that shahrzad was a university student and had been a political prisoner for three years at the time of the shah.
859,guilty,i knew all this and felt guilty.
860,situation,but i was sure god understood the situation.
861,war,"before the second world war, his father, mihaly, who was a  carpenter, had come to iran as a young man to work on a new palace that was being built for the shah."
862,war,"mihaly had left his fiancée, juliana, in budapest in the hope of returning home after the job was done, but the war prevented that."
863,war,"while the war raged on in europe and hungary stood by germany, the allies entered iran to deliver supplies to russia from the south."
864,camp,"and like my grandmother’s fiancé, peter, mihaly was deported to a camp in india."
865,war,"after the war, he returned to iran instead of his native hungary because hungary had become communist."
866,death,"after her death, one of mihaly’s sisters, a spinster of about sixty years of age, came to iran to help her brother raise his children."
867,arrested,my problem is i can’t keep my mouth shut.” “i’m surprised you haven’t been arrested yet.” “i know.
868,arrested,"my parents won’t be able to afford it.” “do your parents know about all this?” “they know some things, but they don’t know everything.” “so you’re telling me that you’re waiting to be arrested?” “do i have any other choice?” “hide.” “they’ll find me."
869,where,and where can i hide?
870,guilty,"i was falling in love again, and this made me feel guilty; i didn’t want to betray arash."
871,prisoners,"in late june 1981, a couple of days after my mother and i arrived at the cottage to spend the summer there, aram phoned and asked me if i had heard that under the influence of ayatollah khomeini, the parliament had impeached president banisadr because he had opposed the execution of political prisoners and had written letters to khomeini, warning against dictatorship."
872,arrested,"a few days later, aram  told me that banisadr had managed to flee to france, but many of his friends had been arrested and executed."
873,police,"his presidency lasted about two weeks: on august 30, a bomb went off at the prime minister’s office, killing president rajai, the prime minister, and the head of tehran’s police."
874,war,"this was also blamed on the mojahedin, but i heard rumors that both bombings were the results of an internal war between different factions of the government."
875,state,"the country seemed to have entered a perpetual state of mourning: at every street corner, loudspeakers broadcasted religious chants and music, and groups of men walked the streets, slapping their chests or hitting their backs with metal chains in the shia tradition, while the women following them wailed and cried."
876,situation,i knew my situation would only worsen if i spent one more day in school.
877,where,"i sat on the chair opposite hers, remaining silent for a few minutes, trying to decide where to start."
878,guard,"if i stayed home, i wouldn’t have to deal with the revolutionary guard teachers."
879,war,he didn’t have to go to war because his family had already given a son.
880,arrest,"she told me that two days earlier, revolutionary guards had gone to gita’s house to arrest her, but she had not been home, so they had arrested her mother and two sisters and had told her father that if gita didn’t give herself up in a week, one of her sisters would be executed."
881,evin,"so gita went to evin and gave herself up, and they let her mother and sisters go."
882,arrest,"well, sirus is next for sure, but he says that anyone who has openly said anything against the government is in danger of arrest.” sirus was right."
883,where,they knew where we lived.
884,guilty,i felt guilty and ashamed.
885,rape,"even though i still didn’t exactly know what rape meant, i told myself that this wasn’t rape."
886,prisoner,"this didn’t make any difference in my case, because i was a prisoner and had no rights to start with."
887,evin,"until this moment, except for the 246 and the interrogation room, i had never seen the inside of evin."
888,building,"yet, the hallway that now lay in front of me could have been any hallway, maybe in a regular government building or school."
889,evin,evin reminded me of the campus of the university of tehran on enghelab avenue.
890,evin,the main difference between the two was that evin had more open spaces.
891,evin,"the other difference was that a see-through metal fence encircled the university of tehran, but evin was surrounded by tall brick walls, lookout towers, and armed guards."
892,building,"ali led me along a narrow, paved road and around the corner of a gray building to where a black mercedes was parked in the shadow of a few trees."
893,prisoner,it will take a little time.” i wondered what his parents would think about his marrying a christian prisoner.
894,situation,i know they won’t understand the situation and will just make it harder.” i couldn’t hold back my tears any longer.
895,evin,"i’ll do everything i can to make it easier.” as long as my friends and family didn’t know about this marriage, the girl i had been before evin had a chance of survival."
896,inside,"she could exist, dream, hope, and love even though she had to hide inside the new me: the wife of an interrogator."
897,prisoners,"upstairs and downstairs were completely separate, and the prisoners couldn’t interact with one another."
898,where,i wanted to be left alone where nobody knew me.
899,execution,i should have tried to stop her execution.
900,death,"i was responsible for her death, because i had accepted her fate."
901,case,i didn’t believe this was the case.
902,death,how could i possibly choose death if it hadn’t called my name?
903,where,"i couldn’t remember what had happened, and i didn’t know where i was."
904,evin,"i asked him if he meant outside evin, and he said he did and told me to finish my soup so we could go."
905,guard,"in single file, they followed a male revolutionary guard."
906,guard,"the revolutionary guard leading them held a length of rope in his hand, the end of which was tied to the handcuff of the woman in the front; he dragged her along and the rest followed."
907,building,"on our right, tall maple trees blocked my view, and on the left was a two-story brick building behind which ali’s mercedes was parked."
908,evin,"at the exit, he waved at the guards, they opened the gates, and we simply drove out of evin."
909,prisoner,"i was the embodiment of everything he stood against: i was a christian, an antirevolutionary, and a prisoner."
910,death,he had had to fight to save me from death and now he had to fight again to marry me.
911,law,"according to islamic law, men are allowed to have more than one wife, but ali’s father, hossein-eh moosavi, had devoted himself to his only wife and two children."
912,freedom,"from the moment i saw you, i knew we had to be together.” i had lost my family, the man i loved, my freedom, my home, and all my hopes and dreams."
913,pleaded,"i pleaded with him to let me go, but he said it was not possible."
914,wall,a tall brick wall separated the yard from the street.
915,inside,"large droplets of water appeared on the foliage, holding the golden sunlight inside their pearly  bodies."
916,war,"had he ever killed anyone, not at the war front, but in evin?"
917,sentence,"“it’s beautiful.” “i planted the flowers for you.” “ali, i’m a prisoner with a life sentence."
918,arrest,"how would i be allowed to live here?” “i’ve convinced all the key officials in evin to let you stay here with me, like a house arrest of some sort, and they’ve agreed."
919,evin,this house is an extension of evin.
920,prisoner,"“so i’ll be a prisoner here,” i said."
921,court,"you were condemned to death by an islamic court and—” “but i never had a trial,” i said."
922,sentenced,"on the night of the executions, ali had told me that i had been sentenced to death, but i had assumed that hamehd, and maybe a few others, had simply decided to execute me."
923,trial,"to me, a trial was what i had read about in books and had seen in movies: a large room with a judge, a jury, a defense lawyer, and a prosecutor."
924,trial,"ali said that i had had a trial, but i wasn’t present when it took place."
925,sentence,"then i received imam’s pardon, and my sentence was reduced to life in prison."
926,sentence,"he believed if i received a retrial after converting to islam and marrying him, my sentence wouldn’t be more than two or three years."
927,evin,"as we drove back to evin, ali said, “i don’t think you should go back to 246."
928,building,"in evin, ali parked the car in front of a building, and we entered it."
929,guard,a guard walked toward us.
930,cell,"thanks be to god.” “is the cell i asked for ready?” “yes, it is."
931,cell,ali stepped in the cell and looked around.
932,cell,the cell was about ten by seven feet and had a toilet and a small sink both made of stainless steel.
933,sink,"i took off my scarf, went to the sink, and washed my face."
934,cell,"the walls of the cell had been painted light beige, but some of the paint had peeled off, exposing the plaster underneath."
935,where,where was she now?
936,tortured,how badly tortured was she when she wrote these words?
937,sentence,"i managed to read a sentence that said: “firoozeh jan, i love you.” trapped and lost lives had left their imprints on the walls around me."
938,sentences,"i followed an invisible line, like a road on a map, connecting words, dates, and sentences that surrounded me like tombstones."
939,death,"death was present here, its shadow sieving every word with finality."
940,cell,"and i deserve all this, this pain, this cell."
941,evin,"the moment i stepped in evin, i was condemned to betraying myself."
942,death,even death turned its back on me.
943,evin,their house wasn’t too far from evin.
944,case,"i wasn’t sure whether i should embrace her, shake hands with her, or neither; some fanatic muslims considered christians to be unclean, so i decided not to touch her in case she would get offended."
945,prisoner,"a christian girl and a political prisoner wasn’t their idea of a suitable wife for ali, and i didn’t blame them for trying to figure out what he had seen in this pale and strange girl."
946,situation,"“this is a difficult situation, marina,” mr. moosavi said after we were finished eating."
947,where,"you need to know where you stand, especially because you’re so young.” as a religious muslim, mr. moosavi followed the custom of never looking a namahram—not a close relative—woman in the eyes."
948,law,"so, please bear with me and let me talk to my future daughter-in-law.” “yes, babah.” “dear girl, you have to know that i do understand your difficulties."
949,situation,i understand my situation.
950,evin,mr. moosavi hoped that i realized that the person i had been before evin was dead.
951,situation,i was surprised by ali’s father’s efforts to resolve a difficult situation.
952,evin,did you like them?” ali asked me on our way back to evin.
953,evin,"“in about a week, we’ll have a small ceremony in evin for you to convert, and our wedding will be on the friday about two weeks after that,” he said."
954,arrested,"you’ve already studied islam since you were arrested, so you just need a name."
955,arrested,"when jesus was arrested, st. peter said three times that he didn’t know jesus, but st. peter believed in his forgiveness and sought it."
956,death,"jesus was tortured, and he died a painful, terrible death."
957,evin,"the ceremony was held after the friday prayer, which was celebrated outdoors in a quiet, wooded area of evin."
958,evin,"evin employees and guards sat in rows, first the men and then the women, but the majority were men."
959,where,"everyone faced a wooden platform where ayatollah ghilani, who was the imam-eh jomeh—the leader of the friday prayer—that day, was to give a speech and lead the namaz."
960,where,i followed ali to the last couple of rows where women sat.
961,sentence,"with shaky steps, i made my way to the ayatollah, and he asked me to say a very simple sentence: “i testify that  there is no god except allah, and that mohammad is his prophet.” to show approval, the crowd yelled “allaho akbar” three times."
962,where,i wanted a bolt of lightning to come and strike me where i stood.
963,guilt,it made my heart ache with guilt.
964,evin,no one dared question what happened in evin.
965,prisoner,"i guessed they knew that an evin prisoner was nobody’s son or daughter, husband or wife, mother or father; he or she was only a prisoner and nothing more."
966,inside,"his friend mohammad came with us, because, as ali had told me, mohammad had never been to a church and was curious to see one from the inside."
967,building,ali parked the car in front of the building.
968,locked,it was locked.
969,arrested,"i expected to feel happy and safe here, but now i could see that my happiness and safety had died the day i was arrested."
970,where,“where did you get the chador?” she asked.
971,inside,words were lost deep inside me.
972,evin,"the last few months of my life had created a circle of pain and confusion around me, holding me captive, not only within the walls of evin, but inside myself."
973,conviction,"“i’ll wait for you,” he said and smiled with conviction."
974,evin,"he was my life the way it had been before evin, and i had to hang on to him to survive."
975,cell,"sixteen  on our wedding day july 23, 1982, after the morning namaz, ali picked me up at my solitary cell at 209, where i had spent about a month without having any contact with other prisoners."
976,death,i had not been comforted like this since my grandmother’s death.
977,taken,"i had not taken a bath in months, only quick showers."
978,arrest,i remembered the bath i never had a chance to take on the night of my arrest.
979,stretch,shirin khanoom told me to stretch out my legs.
980,where,"we had tea after lunch, and as i was sipping my tea, i noticed that  ali’s mother was looking at me thoughtfully, as if she had something important to say but didn’t know where to start."
981,prisoner,“has he told you that he was a prisoner in evin during the time of the shah?” i was shocked.
982,arrested,"“no, he’s never told me.” “savak—the shah’s secret police—arrested him about three years and three months before the revolution."
983,arrest,"i was expecting them to arrest mr. moosavi, too, but they didn’t."
984,tortured,i knew he was being tortured.
985,evin,"we went to evin and asked to see him, but for three months they didn’t let us."
986,prisoner,i first thought he’d lost his mind.” so ali had been a prisoner in evin and had been tortured.
987,cell,"maybe this was one of the reasons why after i was lashed and he took me to the solitary cell, he asked me if i needed something to help with the pain and he arranged for the doctor to come and see me."
988,evin,"after the revolution, he wanted revenge, so he began working in evin."
989,prisoners,"during the first few months after the revolution, most evin prisoners were former savak agents, and he had his chance to get even with them."
990,arrested,"those who had fought alongside him during the time of the shah, the mojahedin and the fadayian, were now being arrested."
991,cell,"i was sure that at the beginning it wasn’t too difficult for him to justify their arrests; his former cell mates and their followers had become the enemies of the islamic state, and as khomeini had put it, they were the enemies of god and his prophet, mohammad."
992,evin,"ali had been raised a devout muslim, and he would follow his imam to the death, but he probably began to see that what was now being done in evin in the name of islam was wrong."
993,prisoners,"his faith had blinded him, but, maybe because of his personal experience, he would sometimes see the situation from the perspective of the prisoners."
994,evin,"for them, all that happened in evin after the revolution was completely justified; they were protecting their way of life and their values."
995,war,"after all, they believed this was a war between good and evil."
996,sentences,"he chanted a few sentences in arabic, which i would have been able to understand if i could concentrate."
997,question,"then, he asked me in persian, “fatemeh khanoom-eh moradi-bakht, are you ready to take seyed ali-eh moosavi as your wedded husband?” i knew it was customary for the bride not to answer this question the first time it was asked."
998,question,"the mullah was to wait for an answer and, not receiving one, repeat the question twice more."
999,where,"ali led me to our bedroom, where gifts had been piled on the bed."
1000,inside,"anger, fear, and a terrible sense of humiliation twisted, turned, and rose inside me like a storm that had nowhere to go, until i had no energy left, until i accepted that there was nowhere to run, until i surrendered."
1001,power,"when i was being tortured, i had managed to maintain a sense of authority, a strange kind of power that physical torment could never steal away."
1002,wall,"although he could see that i was small and slim, i had my back straight against the wall, looking taller than all the others around me."
1003,taken,i had always taken care of myself.
1004,prisoner,“don’t forget that i’m a prisoner.
1005,question,"this was not because i didn’t want to tell the truth, but because i realized i didn’t exactly know the true answer to this question."
1006,conviction,"a few days earlier, i would have said, with conviction, that i hated him."
1007,sink,it made my heart sink.
1008,sentence,"“i can’t have children,” she said and sighed as if this was the most difficult sentence she had ever spoken."
1009,evin,i could tell it was from evin.
1010,evin,"“we’ve known for a while that the mojahedin have plans to assassinate a few of the people who hold important jobs in evin,” he said."
1011,arrest,“we’ve been trying to find and arrest the ones involved.
1012,arrested,a few of them were arrested recently and have been interrogated.
1013,evin,my colleagues and friends believe that it would be safer for marina and me to stay in evin for a while.
1014,evin,"i’m not worried for myself, but i don’t want to put marina’s life in danger.” i had figured that he was important in evin, and this confirmed it."
1015,evin,“i think staying in evin is a good idea.
1016,evin,"“marina, is it okay with you if we stay in evin for a while?"
1017,law,"we have to protect islam, god’s law, and god’s people from the evil forces that are at work against them.” “god doesn’t need protection."
1018,killing,"i don’t know what the solution is, but i know that killing is not the answer.” he pulled me into his arms."
1019,evin,"“you don’t give up, do you?” “when are we going back to evin?” i asked."
1020,evin,"i hope you understand that once we go back to evin, even though you’re my wife, you won’t be treated differently from before."
1021,prisoner,you’re still officially a prisoner.
1022,cell,"do you want to stay in a solitary cell or do you want to go to 246?” i said i didn’t care which one, and he told me the solitary cells were a better choice because then he would be able to spend more time with me."
1023,cell,"if i stay in a solitary cell, will you let the younger ones come and stay with me during their interrogation period?"
1024,where,"“ali, where is sarah farahani?” i asked."
1025,prisoners,there’s another one for prisoners with psychological problems.
1026,cell,now she’s in a cell at 209.” “she needs to go home.
1027,evin,"she won’t survive in evin.”  “hamehd is the one who’s in charge of her case, and you know how difficult he can be."
1028,executed,"i don’t think sarah will be going anywhere soon.” “was her brother, sirus, really executed?” “yes."
1029,cell,"“so your policy is to kill whoever stands in your way.” “if sirus had a chance, he would have shot me in the head.” “you could have kept him in prison instead of killing him.” “this wasn’t my decision, and i’m not going to argue about it.” “can i see sarah?” “i’ll take you to her cell once we’re back.” i had to ask him the question that had been on my mind for a while."
1030,evin,i don’t mean at the front; i mean at evin.” he stepped out of bed and walked to the kitchen.
1031,situation,"i had tried to accept my situation and to understand him, but i couldn’t pretend i didn’t know about the horrible things he had done."
1032,where,your home is where i am.
1033,cell,"about three hours later, i was back in my old solitary cell."
1034,cell,"i reminded him that he had  promised to take me to see sarah, and he took me to her cell but warned me that sarah was heavily drugged and was not going to be very responsive."
1035,cell,i don’t want to upset hamehd.” sarah was writing on the wall when i entered her cell.
1036,case,she had even written about my pencil case.
1037,evin,somewhere beyond evin.
1038,evin,"our homes are still out there, and you have to survive evin to go back."
1039,cell,"after about two weeks, which i mostly spent reading except for when ali was with me, i had my first cell mate, sima."
1040,cell,the guard who brought her to my cell told her to take off her blindfold before he locked the door behind him.
1041,prisoner,i told her my name and that i was a prisoner.
1042,tortured,“they tortured me!” she cried.
1043,tortured,"i moved closer to her and told her that i had been tortured, too, more than she had been."
1044,evin,"she asked how long i had been in evin, and i said, “seven months.” “seven months?"
1045,cell,have you been here in this cell the whole time?” she asked.
1046,trial,"i explained that i had been at 246 and that after her interrogation period was over, she could be sent there as well to wait for her trial."
1047,trial,she wanted to know if i had had a trial.
1048,sentence,“what’s your sentence?” she asked.
1049,evin,"“life in prison.” “oh, my god!” she said she couldn’t imagine being in evin for more than a week."
1050,evin,"sima wanted to know everything about evin’s procedures and the 246, and i told her as much as i could."
1051,cell,ali knocked on the door of the cell at about eight o’clock at night and called my name.
1052,cell,"“don’t worry; he won’t hurt me,” i said as i put on my chador and walked out of the cell."
1053,arrest,ali had been trying to find and arrest him for months.
1054,where,he said he had to make sure sima didn’t know where her brother was.
1055,where,we’ll let her go once her brother gives himself up.” i asked him where he was taking me.
1056,cell,“just another cell.
1057,cell,"after the morning prayer when i returned to my cell, sima was fast asleep."
1058,where,"i told her i had heard that ali was sending her to 246, where she would meet my friends."
1059,cell,"a few days later, ali picked me up at my cell in the evening to go to his parents’ house for dinner."
1060,charge,"but this time, after wishing ali a good night, the guard in charge nodded in my direction and said, “good night, mrs. moosavi.” confused, i looked around and, after a moment, realized he had addressed me."
1061,sink,there was some washed lettuce and a few tomatoes and cucumbers in a colander by the sink.
1062,inside,"i explained that christians believed that god had willed his son, jesus, to become flesh inside mary’s womb and that mary was not an ordinary woman; she had been born for this."
1063,cell,"there’s nothing to lose, is there?”  a couple of days later, early in the afternoon, ali came into my cell."
1064,wall,"he sat next to me, leaned against the wall, and closed his eyes."
1065,wall,she was caught writing death to khomeini and khomeini is a murderer and other things like that with spray paint on a wall on enghelab avenue.
1066,arrested,"when they arrested her, she said she hated the imam because he had killed her little sister."
1067,executed,she’ll be executed soon if she doesn’t behave herself and cooperate.
1068,building,where is she?” “interrogation building.
1069,cell,"i’ll go get her.” about half an hour later, ali pushed a wheelchair into my cell."
1070,prisoner,“i’m a prisoner.
1071,cell,you’re in a cell.
1072,cell,ali took the wheelchair and stepped out of the cell.
1073,arrest,her curly brown hair was dirty and stuck together from constantly being under a scarf since her arrest.
1074,evin,the pain i remembered from my first days in evin was more than a memory.
1075,inside,it lived inside me.
1076,prisoner,“i’m a prisoner.
1077,cell,there was a knock on the door of the cell as soon as she lay down again.
1078,cell,he took me to another cell.
1079,cell,"i just want to go to sleep.” when i returned to my cell at about four in the morning, mina was still asleep."
1080,wall,“i wrote about the rally on a bristol board and put it on a wall in my school.
1081,execution,"they are all murderers.”  “mina, i came very close to execution."
1082,death,"but your death won’t solve anything.” “so, you cooperated and lived,” she narrowed her eyes."
1083,death,my mother hasn’t talked to anyone since layla’s death.
1084,executed,"all of us would have been fine.” “you can’t blame yourself.” “it’s my fault.” “would layla want you to be executed?” “she would want me to do the right thing.” “is committing suicide the right thing?” “i’m not committing suicide!” “if you argue with guards and interrogators, they’ll kill you."
1085,guilty,and what will that accomplish?” “i cannot live with a guilty conscience.” “don’t throw your life away.”  “you can’t change my mind.
1086,cell,"in the evening, ali came to the door of the cell and called my name."
1087,cell,"again, ali took me to another cell."
1088,cell,it was before the morning namaz and still dark when he returned me to my cell.
1089,cell,ali was with me in the other cell all night.
1090,taken,"hamehd has taken her, and ali doesn’t know."
1091,building,i was sure ali was on his way to the interrogation building.
1092,cell,i could knock on the door of my cell and ask a guard to get him for me.
1093,building,"on the other hand, this would only keep ali away from the interrogation building."
1094,cell,"i marched up and down my cell; it took only five or six steps to walk its length, and its width wasn’t much more than three steps."
1095,execution,images from the night i had been taken for execution flashed in my head.
1096,executed,had their families been told that their loved ones had been executed?
1097,where,where were they buried?
1098,cell,i knocked on the door of my cell with my fists as hard as i could.
1099,cell,“allaho akbar…” the door of my cell opened.
1100,interrogation,"“she died last night during interrogation.” “how?” “hamehd said she was talking back, he slapped her, and she fell and hit her head somewhere.” “my god!"
1101,death,"ali didn’t come to see me for five or six days after this, and i spent most of my time sleeping, overwhelmed by mina’s death."
1102,cell,"finally one morning, he brought a young woman named bahar, who was holding a baby in her arms, to my cell."
1103,arrested,they had been arrested in their home and brought to evin.
1104,interrogation,bahar had not been lashed or hurt during her interrogation.
1105,cell,"as usual, ali took me to another solitary cell, but he was very quiet."
1106,charge,you’re the one who’s in charge here.” “i’m not in charge.
1107,charge,"i’ve tried to be, but i’m not.” “who’s in charge then?” “marina, i’m doing all i can."
1108,cell,"and i want you to understand that i don’t want to talk about it.” when i returned to my cell, it was four in the morning, it was very quiet, so i tiptoed to my spot."
1109,guard,she had caught me off guard.
1110,where,where would i start?
1111,arrested,he arrested his own wife?” “no.
1112,execution,"when my other interrogator, hamehd, took me for execution, ali stopped it and then threatened me that if i didn’t marry him, he would hurt my loved ones."
1113,rape,i had no choice.” “this is rape!” “don’t tell anyone about this.
1114,arrested,"i asked her how things had been outside evin before she was arrested, and she told me that nothing much had changed during the last year or so."
1115,imprisonment,"uneducated and undereducated people blindly followed khomeini because they wanted to go to heaven, and the educated crowd remained silent to avoid imprisonment, torture, and execution."
1116,cell,"bahar went to 246 after spending three weeks in my cell, and i began feeling lonely."
1117,acquitted,"i knew that even if i was acquitted, it wouldn’t change much; i was married to ali and i had to stay with him forever."
1118,trial,he told me i would be allowed to attend this trial.
1119,sentenced,she had been sentenced to eight years.
1120,parole,"i’ll try to put her name on the parole list.” “i’m sorry, ali."
1121,cell,"the next morning, ali picked me up at my cell."
1122,building,"the courtroom was in another building, a ten-minute walk away."
1123,prisoners,"employees and guards were rushing from one building to another, sometimes dragging a few prisoners behind them."
1124,building,"we entered the courthouse, a two-story brick building with barred windows and dark hallways."
1125,court,"“in the name of god, the merciful and kind,” said the mullah sitting in the middle, “this court of islamic justice is now officially in session."
1126,sentence,"miss marina moradi-bakht was condemned to death by execution in january 1982 but received imam’s pardon, and her sentence was reduced to life in prison."
1127,serving,"she has converted to islam and has married mr. ali-eh moosavi, who has always protected islam to the best of his abilities and, on many occasions, has  shown a great deal of personal sacrifice while serving the imam."
1128,sentence,"in the light of all these changes, this court has reopened her case and has reduced her sentence to three years in prison, from which she has already served eight months.” all the mullahs stood up, shook ali’s hand again, and asked us to stay for tea."
1129,where,"where were you?” “the solitary cells of 209.” “why?” “i was getting a lot of migraine attacks and couldn’t bear the noise here, so they moved me to 209.” “i see.” i knew she had not believed me, but she didn’t want to ask questions."
1130,sentence,"she told me her sentence had been reduced to life, but her husband was still on death row."
1131,cell,"my name was called over the loudspeaker about three nights a week, and after spending the night with him in a 209 cell, i would return to 246 in time for the morning namaz."
1132,where,"most of the girls never asked me where i went at night, but if someone did, i said i had volunteered to work at the prison hospital."
1133,situation,i could only guess that their situation was probably similar to mine.
1134,evin,"evin’s daily routines carried us through days, weeks, and months."
1135,serving,"because if he is, i’ll—”  “ali isn’t mad.” i began putting the cream puffs on a serving dish."
1136,evin,akram had no right to be so happy when young mothers like sheida suffered in evin.
1137,arrested,she was pregnant when she and her husband were arrested and were both condemned to death.
1138,sentence,"sheida’s sentence has been reduced to life, but her husband still has a death sentence."
1139,evin,but the poor little boy has been raised in evin.
1140,sentence,i’m sure sheida doesn’t deserve a life sentence.” “i’ll talk to ali.
1141,evin,i said that there was so much pain and sadness in evin that i had forgotten how to be happy.
1142,where,“only my parents know where we’re going.
1143,evin,we both needed to get away from evin.
1144,freedom,"for me, this was the scent of a lost world, of freedom, of happiness, and of all the good things that didn’t exist anymore."
1145,sentenced,"“when you were at the front and i was at 246, i found out that a friend of mine, taraneh behzadi, was sentenced to be executed,” i said."
1146,sentence,"even though i was one of your interrogators, it still wasn’t easy for me to reduce your sentence.” “she’s dead."
1147,executed,she was executed.” “i’m sorry.” “are you?” “yes.
1148,execution,"but islam has laws, she broke them, and she was punished.” “but were her crimes terrible enough to justify execution?”  “it’s not my place to decide this."
1149,sentences,"i have managed to help people who i believed received harsh sentences, but i don’t always succeed."
1150,where,"“what?” “do you believe that virgins go to heaven when they die?” “marina, i know where you’re going with this.” “please, answer me.” “no, i don’t believe this."
1151,execution,young girls are not raped before execution.
1152,execution,“you came close to execution.
1153,gate,"ali stepped out, opened a large wrought-iron gate, and, under a canopy of trees, we drove along a paved driveway."
1154,building,"the white, two-story building was twice as big as my parents’ cottage and had a stone lion the size of a large dog sitting on either side of its entrance."
1155,where,"a wide stairway, which reminded me of gone with the wind, led upstairs, where there were six bedrooms."
1156,parole,"“your name is on the parole list,” ali said, standing behind me."
1157,term,what a strange term.
1158,freedom,i couldn’t understand what the word “freedom” meant to him.
1159,taken,he had taken my freedom away from me forever.
1160,evin,"i hated you at the beginning, but not now.” “will you ever love me?” “i don’t know, but i know that as long as you work at evin and a part of your job is hurting people, i won’t be able to love you."
1161,captive,"i’m your captive.” “i don’t want you to think of me as your captor.” “but this is the truth.” “no, it’s your perception of the truth.”  “what do you mean?” “can’t you see?"
1162,prisoner,"“before the revolution, i was a political prisoner for three years."
1163,execution,"i had told taraneh that i had not been raped before they took me for execution, and this was the truth."
1164,sentence,"and taraneh knew this, but she had asked me this question, because although she had accepted her death sentence, she was desperate for even the tiniest bit of reassurance that she would die with dignity."
1165,guilty,"or will you smile and make me feel guilty about all that i have or haven’t done, sending me back to this torment?” the wind brushed past me and flowed into the woods and into the valley of white river."
1166,gate,ali was standing at the gate that opened to the beach.
1167,inside,"“i woke, and you weren’t there,” he said, lifting me off the wet sand and carrying me inside like a child."
1168,evin,we returned to evin after five days at the cottage.
1169,ordered,she ordered a few tests and later told me that i was eight weeks pregnant.
1170,question,his question upset me.
1171,inside,the baby inside me didn’t know anything about my life.
1172,where,"“she’ll stay where she wants,” he said."
1173,question,"i’ve just been feeling nauseous all the time.” “are you happy to be pregnant?” i didn’t want to hear that question, much less answer it."
1174,inside,“your baby will grow and move inside you like this.
1175,guilty,"with them, i felt more loved and cared for than in my old life, and their love made me feel guilty because i realized i loved them in return."
1176,cell,"in a cell that night, ali and i both lay awake in darkness."
1177,evin,"even though ali rarely talked to me about his job, i lived in evin, and i had seen how frustrated he had become."
1178,death,i had especially noticed this after mina’s death.
1179,evin,"he told me he had gotten into a big clash with the prosecutor of tehran, assadollaheh ladjevardi, who was in charge of evin."
1180,prisoner,“he was also a prisoner in evin during the time of the shah.
1181,evin,"i’ve tried to change things in evin, and i haven’t been able to."
1182,where,once he had come for a tour of the sewing factory where i worked.
1183,evin,"i only need about three weeks to put everything in order.” suddenly, leaving evin was becoming a reality, but what i felt was not happiness."
1184,prisoner,"i knew that as ali’s wife, i would always be a prisoner."
1185,death,making decisions about life and death needs a complete understanding of the world that we don’t have.
1186,killing,"if someone holds a gun to your head and you get a chance to shoot and defend yourself, will you do it, or will you die without fighting back?” “i will not kill another human being.” “then bad guys will win, and you’ll lose.” “if winning involves killing, i’d rather lose."
1187,death,"but then, others who witness my death or hear about it will know that i died because i refused to give in to hatred and violence, and they’ll remember, and, maybe someday, they’ll find a peaceful way of defeating evil.”  “marina, you live in your own idealistic world that has nothing to do with reality.” i stayed awake that night after he fell asleep."
1188,evin,"and, maybe, this was why he had saved me from death and married me; i was his strange, desperate way of rebelling against all that went on in evin."
1189,evin,"two weeks had gone by since his resignation, and, over dinner, he told me we would leave evin in about a week and would move back to the house he had bought for us."
1190,where,"we walked toward the car, which was parked about eighty feet away where the street was a little wider."
1191,death,"for a moment that stretched between life and death, a weightless darkness wrapped its smooth, silky body around me."
1192,inside,“call an ambulance!” his mother ran back inside.
1193,death,i wanted to reach beyond the dark depths of death and bring him back.
1194,death,"i laughed and, looking up, saw the angel of death."
1195,where,“where am i?” i asked her.
1196,where,i couldn’t remember where i was.
1197,evin,"when i was finally lucid enough, mr. moosavi told me he would make the arrangements for my release, but he had been told that he had to return me to evin for the time being."
1198,death,he also said ali had made a will a few days before his death and had left me everything he had.
1199,evin,"before taking me back to evin, mr. moosavi took me to see akram and her little boy, whom she had named ali."
1200,guard,"when i walked into the 246 office and took off my blindfold, a guard i had never met before was staring at me."
1201,evin,“where is sister maryam?” “the sisters of the revolutionary guards in evin have been reassigned.
1202,charge,"i’m sister zeinab and i’m a member of the islamic committees, and we’re in charge here."
1203,where,where have you been?” i told her about ali’s assassination.
1204,rape,"he raped you again and again.” “i married him.” “did you want to marry him?” “no.” “he forced you into it.” “yes.” “legal rape is still rape.” “bahar, nothing makes sense."
1205,inside,"then, he took a deep breath and said he’d received information that ali’s assassination had been an inside job."
1206,ordered,"he’s one of them, but it can’t be proven.” i said ali had told me that he had been having difficulties with assadollah-eh ladjevardi, and mr. moosavi said he believed ladjevardi had ordered the assassination."
1207,justice,“is there anything you can do to bring the ones responsible to justice?” i asked.
1208,evin,"i  found it sadly ironic that ali had died almost in the same way as the young men and women executed in evin; members of the same firing squads who had killed gita, taraneh, and sirus had pulled the trigger that had ended his life."
1209,evin,"“i’ve been trying to get you released and i haven’t been able to.” “why?” “because hard-liners, like ladjevardi, who have a lot of influence in evin, say you shouldn’t be allowed to return to your old way of life."
1210,justice,"i might not be able to bring ali’s killers to justice, but i will protect you, because this is what he wanted me to do.” “will you take me to ali’s grave?” i asked."
1211,question,i was surprised to hear this question.
1212,arrested,"“it was ali’s last wish for you to go home, and this means a great deal to us.” she said she had never expected ali to survive when he was arrested by savak and taken to evin before the revolution."
1213,war,he survived the shah and the war to be killed like this.
1214,where,"a few days later, mr. moosavi took me to behesht-eh zahra cemetery, where ali had been buried."
1215,evin,"so many innocents had lost their lives behind the walls of evin and were buried in unmarked graves, and ali was accountable for the terrible things that had happened there."
1216,death,"the hard-liners who were responsible for his death had murdered him because he had become a threat to them, because he had tried to make things better, because he had tried to break free."
1217,war,"most of the dead buried here had been killed in the war, and most of them had been very young when they died."
1218,inside,"inside the tin stand that stood at the head of the grave, there were three pictures of ali."
1219,where,"no one was ever going to wash taraneh’s, sirus’s, or gita’s tombstones or build them tin shrines at the cemetery where friends, family, and strangers could stop, remember them, and offer a prayer."
1220,death,i realized how accustomed to death i had become.
1221,evin,"after dropping akram off at home, mr. moosavi took me back to evin and told me he would do his best to get me home as soon as possible."
1222,sentence,"a few days later, i gave all of taraneh’s belongings, which she had asked me to deliver to her parents, to a close friend whose eighteen-month sentence was close to completion."
1223,death,"i could see myself on the night of the executions when i was supposed to die, tied up to a pole, waiting for death."
1224,evin,"evin had taken me away from home, from who i had been; it had taken me to a realm beyond fear; it had shown me more pain than any human being should ever endure."
1225,state,"but here, grief became a never-ending, raging body of darkness that kept its victims in a perpetual state of suffocation."
1226,case,"he said he would hold all the money ali had left for me in the bank for a year, in case i changed my mind and decided i wanted it after all."
1227,evin,"he had tried to make it easier for me, but he explained that i still wouldn’t be allowed to leave the country for a few years; this was the norm for people released from evin."
1228,arrest,"hamehd will be watching you, and if you give him the slightest reason to arrest you again, he will."
1229,where,"don’t attract any attention.” “i’ll stay home.” mr. moosavi offered to drive me to luna park, where my family would be waiting for me, but i thanked him for his kindness and said i preferred to walk."
1230,evin,"luna park, located about a mile and a half south of evin, was an amusement park."
1231,taken,the government had taken over a part of it for use as a base for shuttle buses for visitors to the prison.
1232,prisoner,"when a prisoner was being released, his or her family had to wait for their loved one at the park."
1233,inside,"my socks were soaked inside my rubber slippers, and my feet were freezing."
1234,guard,"an armed guard stood on top of a lookout tower, watching the street."
1235,wall,"at a corner, a thin, old man wearing a ragged suit stood in front of a decaying clay wall."
1236,tortured,"that within the past two years, i had been tortured, nearly died, been married, widowed, and had lost a child?"
1237,evin,“i’m also going home from evin.
1238,guard,"as soon as we arrived at the gates of luna park, a revolutionary guard stopped us."
1239,arrest,"it was strange that before my arrest, we hadn’t exactly known that we loved each other; we discovered this only after losing one another."
1240,evin,"“yes.” i was surprised he still had the same car, but then, i realized that although my time in evin felt like a lifetime, it had only been two years, two months, and twelve days."
1241,wall,"eighteen  in zenia’s house, i had a bedroom with a window that covered almost an entire wall and overlooked the backyard."
1242,wall,"there was even a small vanity table, which was a part of a wall unit, and on it, in handmade frames from isfahan, were two pictures of me."
1243,taken,my brother had taken both pictures.
1244,evin,"somehow, my real life still existed in evin, and this other world i had stepped into, this place i had called home and had longed to return to, was intangible and alien."
1245,evin,i took my folded clothes out of the plastic bag i had brought from evin.
1246,where,"wishing the world were a simple place where people were either good or evil, i wrapped up the ring again and hid it in a dark corner of my closet."
1247,tortured,“i’m not pregnant.” “were you tortured?” “yes.
1248,evin,"his lips touched mine, and for a few moments, evin became nothing but a memory, unable to keep me captive."
1249,imprisonment,it was probably easier for everyone to pretend my imprisonment had never happened.
1250,death,"how could i tell my family about ali, about my marriage, and about his death?"
1251,evin,"to the moosavis’, or to evin?"
1252,evin,"if i didn’t have mr. moosavi’s support, i would either have spent the rest of my life in evin, or much worse than that, as mr. moosavi had told me, hamehd would have married me off to one of his friends, and i wouldn’t have been able to do anything about it except commit suicide."
1253,arrest,"when he returned from the front, ali had told me that if i didn’t marry him, he would arrest andre and my parents."
1254,inside,"i had believed him then, but now a whisper of suspicion spread inside me."
1255,question,where are they?” she shook her head and looked at me as if this was the most irrelevant question she had ever heard.
1256,arrested,do you know how terrified we were when you were arrested?
1257,taken,it would have taken us years to prove we weren’t communists.” i didn’t blame my mother; she had been scared.
1258,where,i wanted to wear it and walk into my life where i had left it.
1259,evin,i had learned how to sew in evin.
1260,where,"everybody was polite and kind, but that was where it ended."
1261,evin,most people who are released from evin lock themselves up in a room and don’t talk to anyone for a long time.
1262,crime,it was considered a crime for a man and a woman who were not closely related or engaged to be married to be in the same car alone together.
1263,case,"so to be on the safe side, even though we had not discussed marriage, andre asked the priests to give us a letter that explained he and i were engaged, and he always kept this letter in his car in case we were stopped and questioned."
1264,evin,"in evin, mohammad had warned me that i was not allowed to marry a christian."
1265,law,"according to islamic law, a muslim woman isn’t allowed to marry a christian man, but a muslim man is allowed to marry a christian woman."
1266,death,"“you know that if we get married and they find out, i, and maybe you as well, will be condemned to death,” i said."
1267,evin,"“all those days in evin, i wanted to come back to you."
1268,evin,"although i knew it might never happen, i hoped for it.” then, for the first time, he told me that on march 19, a week before i was released, my family had received a phone call from evin early in the morning, informing them that they would let me go that day."
1269,power,had this delay been another result of the power struggle between ladjevardi and mr. moosavi?
1270,evin,"although he knew that because he had come to the church at the time of my visit from evin, the guards knew about our relationship, and it was only at that moment that he realized that the prison authorities had kept a close eye on him."
1271,situation,"“marina, i understand the situation,” he said."
1272,sentence,"i knew very well that this marriage could be my death sentence, but, ironically, i had to risk my life in order to make it mine again."
1273,evin,"in evin, i came close to death, and ali saved me."
1274,evin,"even most of the priests believed we should not marry, but we set our wedding date for july 18, 1985, about sixteen months after  my release from evin."
1275,inside,it’s not worth losing your life.” his words unleashed the anger i had suppressed inside me.
1276,imprisoned,they had imprisoned me and tortured me emotionally and physically.
1277,where,"as we drove back home, i thought about where to begin."
1278,evin,"i had to start at the beginning, the very first moment i stepped in evin."
1279,inside,"this time, i managed to take out three stones, put the ring inside the dark cavity, and put the stones back."
1280,inside,"as the wedding march played, my father walked me down the aisle inside the full church, and i felt happier than i had ever felt in my life."
1281,inside,we took pictures inside the church and in the church’s backyard.
1282,building,"with a view of the alborz mountains, the condo was north of tehran in a high-rise building on the jordan hills, facing the jordan highway."
1283,facility,"almost right after our wedding, andre found a job at tehran’s electric facility, and a couple of months later, we rented an apartment with my parents to share expenses."
1284,war,"the iran-iraq war, now in its fifth year, had begun to escalate."
1285,war,"since the beginning of hostilities in september 1980, the war had mostly skipped tehran; the distance separating the city from iraq had protected us."
1286,evin,"before my time in evin, this name-change process had been slow and not very noticeable."
1287,war,"but after my release, i could see that many street names served as a remembrance to the lives lost in the war."
1288,death,death had become part of daily life.
1289,war,"at the war front, saddam hussein had begun using chemical weapons such as sarin and mustard gas, killing thousands."
1290,where,"as andre and i drove through the city to go to church or to a friend’s house, we would see a large, lonely gap where a house had stood the day before."
1291,wall,"sometimes, a stairway had refused to collapse in the ruins of a family’s life, leading eerily to the emptiness behind it, or a wall covered with floral wallpaper cast its shadow over the dust of lost lives."
1292,evin,"on a wednesday morning about two years after i had been released from evin, the phone rang."
1293,evin,"“speaking.” “marina, i’m calling from evin.” the world stopped."
1294,wall,i put my purse on the floor and rested my weight against the wall.
1295,evin,“we want you to come to evin on saturday to answer a few questions.
1296,gate,"be at the main front gate at nine in the morning, and don’t be late.” “what questions?” “you’ll see."
1297,evin,my life after evin was only a dream.
1298,evin,i couldn’t think about evin.
1299,evin,my father drove me to the main gate of evin; i had decided it was too dangerous for andre to take me.
1300,torture,i wondered if they would torture me.
1301,punishment,they didn’t want to extract information from me; this was about capital punishment.
1302,gate,"adjusting my chador, i went up to one of the guards standing in front of the gate and told him about the phone call."
1303,inside,he asked my name and went  inside.
1304,evin,"there were flowers planted everywhere, which seemed completely out of place in evin."
1305,building,he led me into a building and into a room that was furnished with a desk and five or six chairs.
1306,wall,a picture of khomeini decorated the wall.
1307,death,"hamehd had plans for you, but we’ve been able to stop him.” “what do you mean?”  “he found out about your second marriage and tried to have the courts of islamic revolution condemn you to death."
1308,evin,hard-liners like hamehd have been losing support in evin.
1309,guilty,"i felt guilty for not loving him and for not hating him, but it was over, and there was nothing i could do."
1310,evin,"from evin, i walked to the highway and waved down a cab."
1311,death,"it was as if death were trying to push me away, to protect me, and i couldn’t understand the reason why."
1312,evin,"what happened?” i told him they were doing a routine check, the same way they did on everyone who had been in evin."
1313,situation,"it’s hard to say what they’ll do tomorrow.” i knew that if hard-liners like hamehd gained more power and support in evin, my situation would change dramatically."
1314,war,"i was terrified of the war, not only because of the missile attacks but because, in a few months, andre had to leave for his mandatory military service."
1315,stretch,"sometimes, when we stopped to stretch our legs, i realized how quiet the desert was without the constant hum of the car."
1316,war,"the war had not touched zahedan, which was quite far from the iraniraq border, but the missile attacks on tehran and seven other cities continued."
1317,building,"it’s safer here.” marie lived in a high-rise condo building, not too far from my parents’ apartment in tehran."
1318,where,"tehran is not safe, no matter where you are.” “trust me."
1319,court,"it’s better here.” “maman, tell me what’s going on right now, or i’ll get on the next plane and come and find out for myself.” “our street was hit yesterday morning.” my parents lived on a small court."
1320,where,"“where did it hit exactly?” “first house on the corner.” four houses down the street, and she wasn’t hurt?"
1321,hole,"now it’s just a big, dark hole as if it was never there."
1322,hole,“there’s only a hole.
1323,war,i found pieces of your closet door in the front yard.” the war finally ended in august 1988 when i was about four months pregnant.
1324,prisoners,"after this, hundreds of evin prisoners who had been accused of sympathizing with the mojahedin were executed."
1325,inside,"i soon began to feel it move inside me and the experience made me cry, because i realized i loved it even more than i ever thought possible."
1326,inside,"the gynecologist believed that the baby was hydrocephalic, a serious condition in which water accumulates inside the skull of the fetus."
1327,hole,"“we should just drill a hole in its head and take the baby out; it’s not worth a cesarean section,” the gynecologist said."
1328,where,"we were soon on our way to tehran, where one of my cousins got her gynecologist to see me."
1329,ordered,"the doctor ordered another ultrasound, and after it, i was told that the baby was fine—it just had a big head."
1330,inside,"i needed this new life to be safe inside me, to be born, and to live."
1331,death,people had known his death was imminent.
1332,evin,my two years in evin flashed in my mind.
1333,evin,"the revolution was supposed to be the end of evin, but it wasn’t."
1334,death,"he had no idea that a man named khomeini had changed the lives of his parents, and i wondered how khomeini’s death was going to affect us and iran."
1335,power,"many believed that the islamic government would not survive his death, that a power struggle between different factions of the government would bring an end to the islamic republic."
1336,evin,"all i could think of was the innocent, young lost lives of the revolution, of evin."
1337,imprisoned,was their hatred of the western world so deep that they didn’t mind their innocent children being  imprisoned and murdered?
1338,power,maybe their relationship with him had nothing to do with love but was a fearful and awestruck admiration for a man from a poor family through whom they had found power and authority to stand up to a world that had bullied them for a very long time.
1339,taken,"khomeini’s coffin was taken out of the truck to be moved into the helicopter, but the crowd got hold of the coffin, and it broke."
1340,taken,a metal casket was taken out of one of them.
1341,death,"months went by, and the islamic regime survived khomeini’s death."
1342,freedom,"the number of arrests decreased, not because there was more freedom, but because everyone knew the high price of speaking against the regime."
1343,evin,"when i was released from evin, i had been told that i wasn’t allowed to leave iran for three years."
1344,evin,the passport office would give me a letter to take to evin to ask for permission to leave the country.
1345,situation,"my situation was more complicated, but i wouldn’t know for sure until i tried."
1346,evin,i took the letter they gave me at the passport office to evin.
1347,prisoner,"although he didn’t know all that had happened to me in prison, he knew that i had been a political prisoner and that i didn’t have a future in iran."
1348,building,"with the help of the owner of the factory, he and a few other workers had invested in a piece of land to build a small condominium building."
1349,building,"one day, we received a phone  call from a lady who worked at the factory, and she informed us that the work on the building had begun."
1350,evin,"i went to evin, put in the deposit, and obtained mine."
1351,where,"first, the narrow, residential streets of davoodieh, where we lived after returning from zahedan, and then the wide main streets lined with stores."
1352,where,this land was where my loved ones were put to rest—and i had to leave it.
1353,where,i wanted my children to see the home where i had once belonged.
1354,where,"i wanted to show them the road that took me to school, the park where i played, and the church that gave me the gift of faith and peace."
1355,law,"it was against the law to take antiques, too many pieces of jewelry, or large sums of money out of the country."
1356,where,"maybe they weren’t lost, and, someday, i would find them all under the moss-covered stones of my prayer rock in a strange forest where angels lived."
1357,where,"epilogue  on august 28, 1991, after we had spent eight days in madrid and then ten months in budapest waiting for our paperwork, a swissair plane took us to an airport in zurich, where we stood in line, waiting to board our flight bound for toronto."
1358,where,"i had taught michael some english and had told him about a beautiful country named canada, where it snowed a lot in winter and we could build big snowmen and where summers were warm and green and we could go swimming in blue lakes."
1359,where,"it would be our new home where we would be free and feel safe, where we would raise our children and watch them grow, and where we would belong."
1360,evin,"postscript  zahra kazemi died in evin on july 11, 2003."
1361,arrested,"on june 23, 2003, the canadian-iranian photojournalist had been taking photographs outside evin during student-led protests when she was arrested."
1362,death,"during the few days following her death, the iranian president, mohammad-eh khatami, called for an internal investigation."
1363,death,"iran admitted she had been beaten to death but, ignoring international pressure, buried her in iran."
1364,arrested,"iranian authorities arrested a few security agents whom they said might have been responsible for zahra’s death, but they were all soon released."
1365,trial,"at the end, an iranian intelligence ministry interrogator named mohammad reza aghdam ahmadi was charged in her death and was put on trial but was acquitted."
1366,evin,"i had begun the work on my memoir in january 2002, and i had just written my third draft, so my memories of evin felt quite fresh."
1367,power,"i knew that what i had gone through in evin was still happening behind its walls, but seeing zahra’s picture and her beautiful smile gave this knowledge a painful and shocking power that cut through me."
1368,taken,the world had now taken notice because zahra was a canadian.
1369,captive,i was not going to let fear hold me captive any longer.
1370,death,but my death wouldn’t have helped anyone.
1371,prisoners,zahra had given iran’s political prisoners a name and a face; now it was my turn to give them words.
1372,where,"acknowledgments  frankly, i don’t know where or how to begin; maybe i should invent new words, because “thank you” and “i’m grateful” sound too ordinary and inadequate and make me feel like i’m committing an act of treachery."
1373,death,"scott simmie: we both know a great deal about loss, struggle, and grief, and we have both found freedom, happiness, and comfort in the written word and in the unexpected fragrance of roses and daffodils, fragrances that give life and warmth to the vast loneliness death leaves behind."

1381,law,"he was always trailing after me, sucking candies and calling out: “maman rahimeh!” we tiptoed past the prayer room, a bit chastened by the portrait of imam ali, the son-in-law of the prophet mohammad."

1402,where,“where does your friend live?
1403,crime,the boy’s crime was what identi ed him.
1404,police,he wasn’t worried about getting pulled over by the police.
1405,law,"he was on a mission, above and beyond the law."
1406,rape,"because of the widespread turmoil on the streets, the boys were unlikely to be arrested or even put on trial for rape, so baba knew that getting them to ayatollah shahami was imperative."
1407,death,abdollah  january 1979 baba and abdollah pushed through the crowd of protesters chanting “death to the shah!” posters of the stern ayatollah khomeini were stapled to sticks.
1408,building,it struck abdollah as odd when baba turned down a side street and stopped at the large glass front doors of an anonymous-looking building.

1417,police,"“i don’t care if the grand ayatollah shahami says there’s no police force to take them, haji."
1418,where,at least we know where they are.
1419,police,"i promise you, it’ll just be a few more weeks, just until ayatollah shahami has an o cial position and they have a handle on the government’s new police force.” maman was livid."
1420,criminals,because he doesn’t want to risk exposing his wife and kids to criminals.
1421,power,"“please don’t do this for them.” baba explained that khomeini’s ad hoc security forces were jockeying for power over the shah’s police, the kalantari, and neither police force was willing to apprehend the boys."
1422,guard,"under these circumstances, ayatollah shahami requested that baba con ne and guard the two boys in the hotel."
1423,jail,"and no one will, until the boys are gone and sent to a proper jail."
1424,locked,i don’t care if the rooms are locked.
1425,police,"it’s going to be all right.” unable to contain his enthusiasm, he piled us into the car to drive down to the celebration where thousands, including some of the shah’s former police, poured onto the streets to welcome ayatollah khomeini back from his 14-year exile in iraq and france."
1426,freedom,"men were riding each other’s shoulders chanting, “esteghlal, azadi, jomhouri-ye eslami.” they wholeheartedly believed in independence, freedom, and the islamic republic of iran."
1427,power,power would be delegated to a range of clerics —including religious leaders akin to archbishops.

1432,power,"with khomeini o cially in power, there were now ad hoc tribunals and revolutionary courts in place, and baba was ready for justice to be properly served."
1433,authorities,“it is not a prison.” shahami agreed to turn them over to the new authorities.
1434,custody,he left the manager and abdollah in charge of the hotel and released the boys into shahami’s custody.
1435,jail,"as the revolution calmed down and the new regime established itself, the two boys were held in a real jail cell, without a bathroom or the service of a hotel."
1436,justice,"at last, baba believed, they’d receive justice."

1439,crime,"the memory of the crime scene—the bloodied clothes, the poor woman’s wounds—was still vivid."
1440,chain,"the top button was open, exposing a gold chain on a few dark chest hairs."
1441,inside,"the evidence, which had not seemed serious until now, added up: abdollah was acting more and more like other teenagers in mashhad, boys who didn’t follow the strict traditions observed inside our family’s walls."
1442,clink,"i set the spoon i was holding back on the plate, trying not to clink the metal against the china."

1447,charge,"abdollah, you and the manager will be in charge of making sure all her needs are met, and that no one knows they are staying here."
1448,charges,there will be no bills or other charges to their rooms.

1459,taken,"when i think back, it was as if he was already gone, taken from us."
1460,where,"when the camaro nally disappeared around the last corner, baba’s car limped back to the main road, where the car horns still blared."

1468,police,"she began sobbing and begged the police not to call her parents, nally admitting that the people in the house regularly had parties, consumed drugs, and engaged in sex."
1469,gate,the thump of a soldier’s ri e butt on the heavy metal gate scattered the chickens; their startled cries rose with the slam of each car door.
1470,gate,"she hung onto her head scarf to shield her face, pushing against the gate latch to keep it closed."
1471,police,who’s there?” “komiteh.” morality police: islamic revolutionaries recruited to monitor people’s “moral” behavior.
1472,police,what was khomeini’s police force doing here?
1473,where,and where were her husband and son?

1481,arrest,“khafeshoon kon!—don’t breathe or i’ll arrest you.
1482,guard,"go.” as the guards stomped past us, a teenage soldier with soft eyes leaned down, moving his ri e aside, and whispered to maman, “it’s orders from the revolutionary guard."

1489,murder,they were accused of bank robbery and a murder connected to the hidden gun.
1490,crime,"after fabricating, then recanting a story that baba had masterminded the crime, the two boys claimed that abdollah had driven them to the bank where they stole a total of 2,000 tomans—the equivalent of $300—and shot the bank security guard who attempted to stop them."
1491,charge,"to our family, the idea that abdollah had done such a thing was as ludicrous as the charge that baba had been involved."
1492,justice,"in the bloody chaos that followed the revolution, there was no justice—only blind vengeance."
1493,executed,"the headline of that morning’s paper read: “more mofsede-fel arz —o enders of the moral order—to be brought to justice and executed.” in the article, abdollah’s name appeared rst."
1494,punishment,"under the new islamic republic, ayatollah khomeini established a judicial system run by clerics that carried out heavy punishment for even the smallest crimes that were believed to be “spreading corruption” through iranian society."
1495,trial,"baba underestimated the signi cance of abdollah’s trial, which was covered extensively in the newspapers and on the radio."

1498,court,anyone could be sentenced to death on any charge—without proof in court.
1499,power,abdollah’s case was one of the rst tried in the new courts: a test of ayatollah khomeini’s power and that of his newly appointed judges.
1500,case,"one of these was sheikh ferdus, a disciple of khomeini who  would use this case to establish a name for himself."
1501,robbery,abdollah’s claim that he had no knowledge of the robbery was irrelevant.
1502,courtroom,"in the courtroom, among the buzz of conversation, baba overheard a man ask, “this is what our country has become?” he looked at baba."
1503,where,"i promise.” in the windowless courtroom, baba stared at the empty chair where abdollah’s lawyer would have sat."
1504,trial,"recognizing that the verdict was already decided, the celebrity lawyer baba had own in from tehran had quit mid-trial."
1505,court,"in those panicked moments when baba found himself without a lawyer for his son and saw the court was about to adjourn, he made a request to address the court himself."
1506,trial,"in the back of the courtroom, maman closed her eyes, thanking god that this was the last day of the trial, the last day she would be sitting far away from her son as he stood trial."
1507,trial,"weeks before abdollah’s trial, a bigger picture of his accusers had emerged."
1508,rape,"earlier on the night of the rape, the two boys had also robbed and murdered a jewelry store owner."
1509,criminals,"how could anyone believe these criminals as they accused my brother, who had barely known them?"
1510,where,there was a hush as baba rose from the seat where his lawyer once sat.
1511,courtroom,"squaring his shoulders, he walked to the center and faced  the courtroom full of people, looking directly into their eyes as he spoke."
1512,courtroom,"he’s no robber, no murderer.” maman didn’t take her eyes o baba as he addressed the courtroom, talking about his son, his family, his business, and his commitment to the community."
1513,courtroom,"almost everyone in the courtroom, including the 40 hotel employees present, stood at the close of his speech."
1514,court,he refused to give the verdict in court and declared that it would be reported in the coming days.
1515,guilty,"baba’s knees buckled when he read the words: “abdollah, mofsede-fel-arz—moral sinner—found guilty.”  when maman woke that morning, she collapsed when she heard the news of her son’s fate."
1516,sentence,the sentence was death or life in prison.
1517,where,"on the deck, under the blue sky where she could reach out to god as she wept, maman unrolled her prayer rug and raised her arms, palms open, as she recited arabic verses."
1518,guard,"afraid that she couldn’t stop crying, i sat at her feet, keeping guard."
1519,court,"baba reassured her that although the two boys had been ordered to death, abdollah would remain in prison, awaiting a review of the judge’s decision by the newly organized high court of grand ayatollahs in qom."
1520,where,"“baba, where are you going?” baba was bent over, packing the car trunk with watermelons, cantaloupes, and boxes of canned fruits."
1521,arrested,"after abdollah was arrested, there were no calls, no notes, no conversations."
1522,building,"fighting for shade, they crowded together under a weeping willow tree whose yellowish, feather-veined leaves hung over a gray cement building and the eld."
1523,serving,the women fanned themselves as they poured basmati rice onto serving dishes placed on sofrehs laid on the uneven ground.
1524,building,baba chose a spot closest to the cement prison building and placed our blanket on the muddy ground where a few patches of grass were still exposed.
1525,prisoners,"but on one side, a heavyset guard wearing a holster and badge watched as prisoners approached the glass to speak to their families."
1526,prisoner,each prisoner picked up the telephone receiver.
1527,guard,he pulled a roll of money from his pocket and reached to shake hands with the large bearded guard.
1528,guard,"“just one of them and only for a minute,” the guard answered, accepting the handclasp and concealed cash."
1529,where,"back in the muddy yard where families waited, we helped my parents hand out the stews and rice dishes to those still waiting on the patchy grass for visits with their loved ones."
1530,building,"we children understood that the hot, gray building where abdollah sat behind greasy glass was a bad place and that he couldn’t leave any time soon."
1531,court,"“it’s the new islamic court, haji."
1532,authority,i have no authority.
1533,sentence,"the judge must be made to understand that this sentence is unjust.” “each one of these clerics, these new mullahs, are ghting for power."
1534,power,even my boss has no power here in mashhad.
1535,prisoners,"and for my own family’s sake, i cannot risk any involvement.” for the next six months, except for once a week when we drove to the prison with a trunk lled with watermelons, canned beans, pineapple, and peaches for abdollah and the other prisoners, maman spent her days making bargains with god and imam reza."
1536,state,"although baba hated the islamic state run by men who had hijacked his beloved religion for power, he had no choice but to appeal to those clerics, the “men of god,” for his son’s release."
1537,where,"the pomegranate farm  without telling us where we were going, maman and baba crowded my three brothers and me into the backseat of the car and drove 16 hours west to rasht, where the salamats, our close family friends, owned a pomegranate farm."
1538,pleading,"i will never forget your great hospitality and all the wonderful meals you prepared for us when we stayed at your hotel in mashhad.” “i’m here about my son, abdollah,” maman answered, trying to be businesslike though she couldn’t disguise the pleading tone of her voice."
1539,injustice,"“a great injustice has been committed and i came to speak to ayatollah khomeini, to tell him what people are doing in his name and in the name of religion, and to beg him to intercede."
1540,case,"when the eldest daughter returned from speaking to her father, she reported that illness prevented him from receiving visitors, but that he had promised to intercede in abdollah’s case."
1541,court,"later, in fact, he arranged a meeting between baba and a lead judge who was to reroute abdollah’s le from the court in qom to tehran."
1542,case,"there, under khomeini’s oversight, the judge was to “personally review the case and correct it.” however, my parents had heard of so many innocent deaths in the midst of the postrevolution chaos that they worried abdollah’s le would not be handled as planned."
1543,court,"they decided to drive to qom to intervene with the newly formed religious high court, which would ultimately decide abdollah’s case."
1544,court,"the son-in-law of maman’s sister, a cleric with the new court, was the next person to take maman’s hand."
1545,case,“i know his case well.
1546,taken,"now a key gure in the qom leadership, it appeared that ayatollah khabazi had forgotten the risks baba had taken for his family when he hid them from the shah back in mashhad."
1547,authorities,"with promises from the highest authorities in iran, including the deputy to the supreme leader himself, our parents’ hopeful mood lled the car for the long ride home."

1555,guard,"from then on, whenever she went into another room, i waited in the doorway, keeping guard."
1556,wall,"our bikes slumped against the side wall, pedals rusting in the rain."
1557,where,what in the name of god is this?” the manager lowered the window to face the barrel of a semiautomatic ri e. “where do you go in the middle of the night?” a young revolutionary guard demanded.
1558,guard,the guard pointed to the side of the road with the nose of his gun.
1559,guard,"the manager got out of the car, and the rst guard led him away, into the darkness."

1562,state,this is an islamic state.
1563,guard,"maman opened the car door and ew at the guard, her chador aring like bat wings."
1564,guard,"you’re hiding behind the guns you don’t even know how to use!”  maman moved closer; the guard stood, too stunned to move away."
1565,guard,"at ten, he was tall for his age—almost as tall as the guard."
1566,pleaded,“have mercy.” he pleaded with the rst armed man.
1567,taken,"baba  the rose hotel sign—the sign that had taken three years to design and install, the sign that symbolized the business that, for ten years, had consumed baba’s life—stared down at him."
1568,locked,“the doors of the hotel are locked.
1569,where,"“i don’t know how i will manage without you.” as baba climbed into the driver’s seat of the car where we waited, mr. ga ari said a nal goodbye to maman, who kept her head turned away from the house."
1570,question,"“but we’ll come home someday,” i said, afraid to phrase this as a question."
1571,sentenced,the most extreme conclusion i ever considered was that abdollah had been convicted and sentenced to life in the bleak prison where we had visited him.
1572,where,"again, i asked where he was."
1573,question,"we didn’t want to know the real answer and, intuitively, we understood that to question this version would cause our parents more pain."
1574,where,she inhabited a world where the living and the dead were both present; her gaze turned inward and her spirit was gone.
1575,war,"here, far from the turmoil of the iran-iraq war that began shortly after the revolution, our traumatized family might nd a way to come back to life."
1576,inside,"inside, the house was 21,000 square feet, with two ballrooms, ten bedrooms, and white marble staircases."
1577,inside,"we continued to play the same games we had in mashhad; when we weren’t outside in the garden, we would spend hours inside, creating make-believe cities."
1578,police,zain liked being the police o cer and sometimes the lawyer; i held multiple roles as the banker- oristteacher.
1579,where,"almost every morning, she rose from the prayer rug where she now slept and made her way to my bedside, where she changed the wet sheets before i could try to do it myself, or hide them."

1589,wall,"i had been hiding behind a plant, my back against the wall."

1593,sink,"“plus, i have a few things i want to say to him face-to-face.” without responding, maman turned o the re under the pan and moved toward the sink."
1594,injustice,"you needed to speak up against injustice, especially when it was done in the name of islam."
1595,hole,"my son is gone, and that hole will never be lled.” baba’s voice was soft and sad."
1596,sink,"when baba came into the kitchen, he saw her distress as she threw the dishes into the sink without regard for their fragility."
1597,sink,"the kids are around.” maman dropped a bowl, splashing sink water all over herself and the counter."
1598,killing,"“you trusted those bastards, those child-killing ‘men of god.’ ” baba met her gaze."
1599,inside,you did it!” i felt the warm liquid on the inside of my pant leg.
1600,sink,"baba’s jaw tightened and clenched, but he remained at the table as maman went back to the sink, nished cleaning the dishes, wiped the counters, and put the food away."
1601,where,"“and i hate you!” when i heard the water turn o in the kitchen, i headed to the yard, where i knew i would nd her."
1602,inside,"after maman nally went back inside, i stayed in the yard."
1603,inside,i felt hope lling up inside me.
1604,question,“i have wanted to ask you a question for a long time.
1605,where,where is my brother?
1606,pleading,his look was as pleading as his words.
1607,war,"hadi knew that the anti-aircraft warning shots, which had been lighting up the skies since the iran-iraq war had escalated, were about to go o ."
1608,war,"he had a plan, and it involved his own, personal war games."
1609,war,"the real war—the eight-year iran-iraq war—had begun when saddam hussein, fearing a shi’a insurgency and looking to gain the upper hand in long-festering border disputes, launched an air and land invasion into iranian territory."
1610,where,"zain and my cousin, ten-year-old mahnaz, were searching for hadi on the roof, where we often went to play since we weren’t allowed outside."
1611,taken,"after my cousin was taken to the hospital and zain was bandaged, baba walked around the yard and the house; he was looking for hadi who was now missing."
1612,inside,"he could have killed them.” five hours later, hadi was curled in a ball, hiding inside a kitchen cabinet."
1613,guard,"i kept guard, until it was safe for him to come out."
1614,where,he was listening under the doorway to the room where my cousin and khaleh were now staying full-time during her recovery.
1615,guard,"“when she wakes up crying, i run and get maman to bring her pills.” i dropped down next to him and we lay face-to-face, our cheeks against the oor, our noses touching, keeping guard."
1616,wall,hadi snatched the now rolling ball from the rug and used his racket to smack it hard against the wall in the very spot where our grandfather would have been sitting if he were alive.
1617,wall,"when maman found hadi leaning against the wall in our room, she sat down beside him."
1618,war,"because of the iran-iraq war, obtaining visas for an entire family—or for adolescent boys who could serve in the war—was impossible."
1619,guard,"“maman, wait!” as the soldiers grabbed him, hadi shouted, “pedarsag, leave me alone, you bastards.” “what did you say?” a guard growled."
1620,guard,"“someone take this kid before i beat him,” a second guard shouted."
1621,guard,baba pushed against the guard’s chest.
1622,guard,let me go talk to him.” “turn around and go back or don’t y out today.” the guard placed a hand on his gun.
1623,question,"“he’s not dead.” even as i said this, i didn’t know if it was a question or a statement."
1624,where,"but we will come and visit you every friday and take you to your house, where we will all stay together every weekend."
1625,wall,"i sneaked from bed and, hand over hand along the wall, guided myself toward the bathroom."
1626,inside,"once inside, i eased the door closed without making a sound and turned on the light."
1627,where,where was my maman?
1628,where,"six doors and one hallway later, i was nally back at the bedroom, where i could see the shadow of the two beds."
1629,wall,"refuge in london  maman and baba  thousands of miles away in london, iman was pulling at maman’s chador as she wailed and clawed at the oversized wall-to-wall posters of khomeini and khamenei that covered the walls of the iranian religious center where my parents and iman had been sharing a single room."
1630,war,"the doctors had advised against maman going back to a war-stricken country, and baba couldn’t get our money out of iran."
1631,where,"the psychological symptoms she was su ering worried the british  doctors enough to insist that she not return home, where any symbol of the new government could trigger another breakdown."
1632,pleading,"with iman pleading, “no, maman,” she shredded the clerics’ posters, her ngernails scratching through to the concrete."
1633,guilt,"i would do it for you every day, forever.” when she saw the longing and sorrow in his eyes, the lines that had doubled around his forehead, and the guilt that threatened his spirit, she took a deep breath."
1634,pen,someone else had opened the pen.
1635,inside,"inside, the house was quiet, and the curtains, which had blown around when i opened the door, settled."
1636,war,would they have to go back to iran and ght in the war?
1637,inside,"weeping, she sank to her knees, opened her chador, and pulled me inside her robe, pressing her forehead against mine, showering me with kisses, whispering sweet things in my ear."
1638,where,"where were you, little mommy?” taller, with short hair, he was older, changed."
1639,toilet,"in the dark earth underneath the loose toilet pedestal, slugs and worms weaved among mushroom caps."
1640,inside,"the wind blew open her chador, so maman let the air inside to cool her chest."
1641,toilet,"we have enough groceries for now.” the week before, she had shown baba how to separate the toilet paper."
1642,law,and i had to hear this from my brother-in-law?
1643,where,"you see where we live, right?"
1644,where,i don’t know where home will be—maybe somewhere in between these two worlds.
1645,arrest,"any good ayatollah, professor, or lmmaker is either dead, in prison, or under house arrest."
1646,arrest,"he stopped the shah from killing khomeini in 1963; a man of peace, a visionary who believed in keeping clerics away from government positions, is under house  arrest until he dies."
1647,wall,"i’m sorry to tell you that, but we simply can’t.” maman held her chest and leaned against the wall."
1648,war,“you shouldn’t have done this without me.” “our sons would be drafted to be killed in a senseless war.” baba took a breath.
1649,death,"the sunni believed that after the death of prophet mohammad, the muslim leadership should be in the hands of his companions; the shi’a believed the leadership of the faith should stay within the prophet’s family, starting with his son-in-law, imam ali."
1650,war,baba felt that the war was political and irrational.
1651,arrested,"anyone who opposes the regime or speaks out is arrested, beaten, or executed.” baba closed his eyes."
1652,war,“the war will be over someday.
1653,war,this isn’t just about money or the war.
1654,wall,"eventually, i built up enough courage to take o my chador before class, hanging the black robe on a hook next to the jackets on the wall to wear only a head scarf like the other two iranian girls."
1655,where,"then, baba calls us around the sofreh, where he cracks open a pomegranate."
1656,where,“i had a nightmare last night.” maman moved the tissues closer to where she sat cross-legged on the oor.
1657,cell,"every cell of my body tells me that my boys are hungry.”  hundreds of miles away in germany, in their shared room in the home of family friends, zain pushed away his meal, spilling the cold, sticky beans from the corner of his plate."
1658,where,"unlike in iran, where people visited us daily with food and sweets, no one here ever called on us—not once in the last 12 months."
1659,chain,"“stand next to iman, honey.” maman held her hand in the air, gesturing us to stay back as she ipped the chain and slowly slid the door open, peeking around it."
1660,taken,abdollah’s navy blue jacket that hadi had taken with him when we left tehran was folded over baba’s arm.
1661,where,"“where, haji?” she stumbled into the street with her chador only covering half her head."
1662,where,"when hadi and zain stepped out from behind a red car where they had been hiding, maman fell to her knees."
1663,toilet,"it didn’t matter that the money from the house sale hadn’t arrived, or that we had a bathroom with slugs under the toilet."
1664,where,"zain’s crooked body was lying on the ground, his forehead bleeding where the headlight of an old car had grazed him."
1665,arrested,"zain and iman, who were in the car, were ok; hadi had been lucky not to be arrested for driving three years under age and without a license."
1666,case,"hadi forbade music in the house, and during commercials, he would change the channel on the radio in case there was a jingle."
1667,where,now no one knows where he is.
1668,thief,"when she found out that he has a whole other life in iran, with another woman—and that he’s a thief—she was on board.” maman looked at baba and forced herself to stay quiet."
1669,justice,justice  baba  baba arrived in tehran in the dead of night.
1670,police,police.”  the man who opened the door was wearing a white pajama shirt.
1671,thief,"or that you are a swindler, a thief?” hosseini yelled."
1672,arrest,"in fact, unless you have a warrant for my arrest, you can show yourselves the way out.” madressi began to turn when hosseini pulled out his gun."
1673,sentence,"but clearly you’re a crazy man …” before he nished the sentence, duct tape was on his mouth, and one of the policemen threw a brown burlap rice sack over his head."
1674,police,"at the police station, baba’s stomach was grinding with pain."
1675,cell,the cries from the other room seemed to shake the dark gray walls of the cell where he waited.
1676,cell,"delirious with exhaustion, he  noticed that the bars of this cell were cleaner than the ones in the mashhad prison where abdollah had been held."
1677,taken,"for hours, baba listened in until madressi nally acknowledged his name and identity, admitted knowing baba—even acknowledged he had taken baba’s money."
1678,criminals,there are hundreds of families like yours who left iran and relied on these criminals to help them get their money out.
1679,where,"don’t pity him, this is a part of his business.” the commander glanced at the room where madressi hung."
1680,justice,“i’m pleased to help you gain some justice for your family.” another scream came from the interrogation room.
1681,jail,"“god help me.” with every scream, baba thought of what it must have been like in that cold, dirty jail in mashhad."
1682,cell,"he felt an ache in his chest when he imagined how the guards had ung open the bars, dragged his son from his cell, and separated him from his tasbeeh and his qur’an."
1683,torture,"the real torture would be for madressi to nd his own son, cold and lifeless, with bullet holes in his head and chest."
1684,cell,"if abdollah were alive, baba wouldn’t be in this cell, paying policemen to force a man to return his family’s money."
1685,guilt,"“haji, there’s no room for guilt here."
1686,torture,being involved with torture felt corrupt; there was no way not to be tainted by it.
1687,where,"sitting back on the imsy cot where he had been waiting, baba stared at the ceiling."
1688,toilet,"our new apartment had upstairs bedrooms, a full-size stove, a toilet without slimy bugs— and, most signi cantly, a television station that played presley movies."
1689,jailhouse,"i clicked it on, and the rst shot of the revolution was red: “jailhouse rock”!"
1690,cell,"everybody in the whole cell block was dancing to the jailhouse rock.” at that moment, two victories occurred on the rebel side."
1691,where,"home would have to be where we were, not where we had been."
1692,guard,"for the second time in our lives, what was supposed to be a two-week trip stretched to two years, catching maman and the rest of us o guard."
1693,inside,"inside, deep plush rugs and the sacred qur’an gave our new household the feel of a traditional persian home."
1694,police,baba’s success in creating a business and purchasing a home was not matched by his ability to police his household.
1695,authority,"it’s time to be a man, to take responsibility.” to baba, wearing an earring and going to a dance made his older son hadi’s recent behavior—getting expelled from school, collecting speeding tickets, and rejecting authority—seem like child’s play."
1696,where,do you know where that dance leads next?” he took in a deep breath.
1697,case,"i imagined that the qur’an caught a splinter of glass, and shivered in its case."
1698,where,where was the prank-playing brother who swung upside down from tree branches?
1699,where,"beyond the walls of our home where english was spoken, hadi was our protector."
1700,where,but i could never see where he was.
1701,assault,my head dropped and my hands covered my face; i froze for the now familiar assault.
1702,guilt,a ash of guilt came over me.
1703,thief,"as i took down the box and popped open the lid, i knew why i’d felt like a thief."
1704,police,a decade of being silenced— rst by khomeini’s secret police and then by my parents’ decision to hide the truth from us—had passed.
1705,locked,maman locked eyes with me.
1706,where,"suddenly animated, she lifted out each picture and explained where each was taken and when."
1707,arrest,"there it was, abdollah’s last picture: the black-and-white photo in his navy blue suit, taken just before his arrest."
1708,question,"what really happened to abdollah?” when, at the same age, hadi had asked the same question of mr. ga ari and baba back in iran, he had never gotten a real answer."
1709,arrest,"she didn’t tell him everything, but for an hour as they talked, she told him in parts about the terrible events that led to abdollah’s arrest."
1710,death,"abused by her husband, she was beaten badly and her death devastated the family."
1711,guilt,"even though baba was just a child, he carried tremendous guilt."
1712,abuse,"baba’s brother also had a daughter, who was married at 17 to a clergyman with substance abuse problems."
1713,court,"after he heard maman’s story, he vowed to study law and sue iran in the world court."
1714,killing,someone needed to pay for killing our brother and destroying our family.
1715,escaped,"we had escaped warstricken, postrevolutionary iran, but we faced a di erent kind of revolution in america: a revolution from within."
1716,guilt,our father also battled inner rage and guilt that he could not share.
1717,crime,"hadi acted as if he were interrupting a crime, or adultery."
1718,death,"therefore, in his death, abdollah had become a saint."
1719,death,"this left me, as i approached 15, to be the next child who would need protection and insulation from these two fathers who carried the burden of abdollah’s death."
1720,war,"the two wars  there were two persian gulf wars for me: the public one, which transpired after iraq invaded iran, and the private war, in which i felt personally under attack in high school."
1721,war,he was a journalist for the local newspaper and was interviewing high schoolers about their views on the war.
1722,war,he had not even heard of the iran-iraq war.
1723,war,"baba had been struggling since the gulf war hurt his carpet business, and i hadn’t asked him for lunch money for over six weeks."
1724,where,“you will not be going to work for god-knows-who in god-knows-where for god-knows-why.” he hadn’t heard a word i’d said.
1725,sink,i need to work.” baba set the cup he had been holding in the sink and turned his back to me.
1726,wall,i chewed on my lower lip and turned toward the wall.
1727,where,"every afternoon for four months, on the hour-drive back and forth to my rst job, baba needed to know who my supervisor was, how much they would pay me, where i would sit, what color the walls were, did they have wastebaskets near my desk so i wouldn’t be inconvenienced or ogled as i crossed the room of mostly men, and how the other women dressed who worked there."
1728,case,"because hadi had been monitoring my behavior closely, i had asked my friend to drop me o a few houses down from ours, just in case he was home and looking out the window."
1729,inside,i ran out of the house and refused to come back inside.
1730,inside,"i’m not leaving until you come inside.” “he won’t apologize, and i’m not coming in while hadi’s there."
1731,situation,"what’s your plan for work, for a living situation, for marriage?"
1732,taken,"in the note, hadi had reconstructed his last eight months out of the house: how he had taken my hairbrush with him so he would be reminded of what he had done, how he had thought of me every day."
1733,bully,"when he visited on the weekends now, zain and iman and i were hopeful our real brother, and not the dictatorial bully, was returning to us."
1734,state,i was going to college at cal state fullerton in the fall.
1735,serving,"each day, maman knocked softly and entered carrying a serving tray with sabzi, persian hot tea, and turmeric chicken sprinkled with barberry rice, shanna’s favorite."
1736,where,"before i entered the kitchen, where the yelling shook the walls and rattled the cups in their saucers, i paused for a deep breath."
1737,guilt,"not only did he carry the guilt for abdollah’s death—but had that trauma not caused our exile to america, my brothers would never have been exposed to dancing, non-muslim women, and a host of other forbidden things."
1738,wall,"they’re married.”  baba stopped moving, and then he slammed his st against the wall, causing a picture to crash and break."
1739,state,"meanwhile, instead of being married as many of my iranian cousins had been at 16, i was living at home and attending college at nearby cal state—the rst in my family to attend university."
1740,power,"he mimicked baba by asserting his power and strictness, as well as his grandiose dreams that would rise and then fall."
1741,imprisoned,"after the initial bliss of fatherhood, zain felt that he was imprisoned forever."
1742,where,"with a son who was shirking his responsibility, baba felt disgraced in the community where he had preached the value of marriage and family."
1743,police,"from my second oor window, i could see a squad car—“irvine police department” was written on the side—and two uniformed police o cers."
1744,police,"but a weekend movie marathon of clint eastwood and police academy lms had kept them up all night, and they had just gone to bed after their morning prayers."
1745,police,"“our car doesn’t have tinted windows or chrome wheels; it’s the basic model.” a speed junkie like his brothers, iman had been pulled over a few times for weaving in and out of tra c. i gathered that the irvine police had already identi ed our white toyota tercel and its middle eastern-looking driver."
1746,where,"“do you know where your brother was last night at midnight?” “yes, he was with me and my other two brothers."
1747,crime,“just for a few minutes.” it turned out that the o cers wanted to question iman about a crime the night before involving two teenagers who had attacked and robbed two caucasian kids behind the albertsons grocery store near our house.
1748,case,"when maman walked down the stairs with iman, i explained that it must be a case of mistaken identity."
1749,imprisonment,"for every hour of the next two months, we relived the helplessness and horror of abdollah’s arrest and imprisonment at the same age as iman."

1752,cell,"when he placed tissue paper on the oor of his cell to prostrate himself in morning prayers, his gangbanger roommate kicked him in the kidneys and slammed him against the wall, calling him “camel jockey.” after a  guard removed the bully and iman returned to his prayers, his words were soft."
1753,cell,"iman found himself talking to abdollah, whom he had last seen in a cold cell like the one in which he was now imprisoned."
1754,detention,"although we all drove to the juvenile detention center, only two visitors were allowed at a time."
1755,incarceration,"the next time i saw iman, it was in a courtroom nearly three months later, where the judge dismissed the charges against him as wrongful incarceration."
1756,arrested,"the only reason iman had been arrested was because the cops had shown the boys only iman’s picture, asking them if he had been their attacker."
1757,county,i sued orange county on iman’s behalf six months later.
1758,case,we had a great case.
1759,county,"but a year later, the county led for bankruptcy, and all cases were discharged."
1760,locked,shanna and i locked eyes over zahra as she dozed between us in the backseat; we each held one of her tiny hands.
1761,war,"because they had not served in the iran-iraq war, they would be immediately conscripted into the iranian army if they returned."
1762,freedom,"for her, the american dream meant the freedom to return home."
1763,sink,"the way you do things, it could be another year before we are ready to go.” maman bumped a large pot with her elbow; it slammed against the drain board and crashed into the sink."
1764,sink,maman started tossing pans into the sink; baba sat at the dining room table looking out at the yard.

1766,inside,"although she couldn’t read english, she recognized what was inside: two plane tickets."
1767,cell,"but rst, we have a lot of shopping to do.” ten days later we packed our oversized suitcases with the iranian “wish list”—neosporin, tylenol, advil, antibiotics, valium, xanax, band-aids, saran wrap, sugar-free gum, ziploc bags, paper toilet seat covers, used cell phones, perfumes, designer clothes, brandname makeup, and boxes of kit kat bars—and headed to the airport."
1768,building,"planes were haphazardly parked on the grounds, some far away from the single entrance to the building."
1769,war,"the city was much smaller than i remembered, and posters of khomeini and khamenei were plastered on every wall next to pictures of dead men “martyred” in the iran-iraq war."
1770,where,"during the 72-hour layover in tehran en route to mashhad, where most of her family lived, maman had time to take care of some business—including an unresolved dispute between baba and the buyer of our mansion on parvaneh street."
1771,where,"almost immediately, i was ooded by memories: where were the chickens?"
1772,where,"where were the willow trees where we played hide-and-seek, the path where i learned to ride a bike, the orchard of walnut and cherry trees?"
1773,guilty,i felt ashamed and guilty for the accusing look i had given him.
1774,where,"almost immediately after arriving by plane in mashhad, we hailed a cab to my uncle’s residence, where my grandmother, now 88, was living."
1775,inside,i had forgotten how beautiful the haram was and how light i felt when inside.
1776,war,"the faces of young boys, martyrs of the war— shaheeds—were all around us."
1777,gate,"we had now been away 45 days, and the smell of exhaust lled the air as we sat at the gate of the airport waiting for our return ight."
1778,guilty,"having visited cousins who lived in fancy mansions with gold knobs and imported italian marble while seeing that the majority of the iranian people now had to live hand to mouth, i was lled with sadness: for those who didn’t have enough and were hungry, and for the ones who did and felt guilty."
1779,freed,"in many ways, going to iran and visiting abdollah’s grave had nally brought him back to us, and freed me."
1780,authority,"her visit with the rest of her family had also reminded her of her old self, when she was more like her mother—always supportive of her husband, but quietly challenging his authority."
1781,where,his skin had pruned and peeled o around his cuticles where he chewed his nails.
1782,abuse,"finally, i convinced iman, hadi, my parents, and shanna to meet with a substance abuse interventionist."

1784,death,"“maybe even face death.” clearly, this doctor had no idea what he was asking of us."
1785,inside,"“hadi, aren’t you coming inside?” i spoke in english so maman wouldn’t understand us."
1786,where,"each time he circled the decorated tiles of the haram’s outer yard, he avoided the entrance where the old men were sweeping dust and dirt into the air."
1787,where,he spent the rest of the night at an underground party where champagne corks popped and plates of ecstasy were passed around like o erings of sugar cubes.
1788,county,"it began in orange county, california, when baba was hospitalized."
1789,building,"lighting up the sky, it was the home of the ka’ba: the cube-shaped building that all muslims around the world face during prayer."

1791,inside,"another wave of anger ashed inside me, but i pushed it aside."
1792,where,“where do you want me to begin?
1793,stretch,"every few minutes, he would stretch his neck and ask, “you follow?"
1794,freedom,"as he told the story of the days of the revolution—the lawlessness, the violence, the smell of freedom that mesmerized millions—it seemed as if a movie were playing in front of me."
1795,rape,"baba told me about the rape of the old woman, how he was called to act, and why he couldn’t say no."
1796,where,"but i reassured her, over and over, that it would be ok. at least we knew where they were, instead of loose on the streets, i told her."
1797,state,"but given the fragile state of his health, i didn’t want to press him too hard."

1802,where,"fourteen years my senior, he was my colleague at the psychiatric hospital where i worked on the weekends to pay for my graduate courses."
1803,question,"finally, he got to the most important question of all: how did yarek feel about god?"
1804,question,"the discussion began not with a question, but with a sermon."
1805,captive,"true to his nature, yarek was quiet, making baba feel that he had a captive audience."
1806,where,"“rahimeh, what is the nature of your relationship with this man?” “i told you, baba, i met him at the psych hospital where i work."
1807,slam,i yanked the door shut with a slam.
1808,where,"i knew others wondered where they, too, could nd some alcohol."
1809,inside,outside a thunderstorm was shaking the trees in the yard; zahra’s pet rabbit had to be brought inside because he was thumping at his cage in fright.
1810,where,"“where’re you going, haji?"
1811,cell,"i whispered, “you’re going to be ok, maman.” maman’s cell phone rang."
1812,where,"“maman, where are you?"

1814,slam,i’m crap.” he began to slam his head against the windshield.
1815,police,"“baba, i’m calling the police,” i yelled into the phone."
1816,police,“no police.
1817,police,he would never call the police on one of his sons again.

2311,locked,then she locked herself in her room in fright.
2312,law,"that night, her brother-in-law came to her door, whispering through the lock that he'd give her seven days to yield, which became six and five and four, until all the days were spent."

2332,charge,"she had an entourage now, spoke farsi as well as her native circassian, and appeared to be in charge of her sisters."
2333,inside,"i had heard stories about women who became deformed by long hours of sitting at the loom, so that when they tried to deliver a child, their bones formed a prison locking the baby inside."
2334,trial,we found five women knotters who needed to earn money and asked them to come for a trial day of work.
2335,ordered,i approached one of the guards and told him i needed to deliver a carpet ordered by one of the ladies.

2337,guard,"after unrolling the carpet and checking that nothing prohibited was hidden in it, he escorted me through a group of wooden gates, each manned by a different guard."

2341,pen,"after the bald eunuch brought them in, i sat cross-legged next to her, dipped the pen in the ink, and drew one of the feathery shapes, after which i let my pen dance around other common carpet motifs, like roses, cedar trees, onagers, and nightingales."
2342,inside,drawing would be a new way to amuse herself inside the harem.

2359,term,"bringing a novel to term is demanding not just for the writer, but for everyone close to her."
2360,case,"in my case, the riches emerged in the form of books about pre-modern iranian history and culture, which were similarly hidden away on dusty library shelves where  few people ventured."
2361,court,"when the shah took power at the age of seventeen, iran had endured a bloodbath in which members of the safavi royal court were blinded or murdered in a struggle for power, and many soldiers and large chunks of the country were lost during wars."
2362,justice,"during his forty-one-year reign he proved to be a brilliant administrator, although his approach to justice was harsh by today's standards."
2363,where,"i set the blood of flowers in the 1620s, at which point the shah had succeeded in defending the borders of iran, vanquishing his internal political enemies, and creating a climate where the arts could flourish."
2364,court,"according to iran scholar roger m. savory, ""under his patronage, carpet weaving was elevated to the status of a fine art,"" so that in addition to being created by individuals working on their own looms, carpets were woven by urban specialists who were trained to make masterpieces for the court."
2365,court,"remarkable examples of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century iranian court carpets survive in museums and private collections, and a number of rug scholars believe that the carpets of the safavi period (1501-1722) rank among the finest ever produced."
2366,power,"when the shah first came to power, his capital was located in qazvin, a northwestern iranian city."
2367,where,"by 1598, the shah had moved his capital to isfahan, a more defensible site in the center of the country, where he undertook one of the most remarkable renovations in urban planning history."
2368,taken,"however, i have taken the liberty of compressing events within the novel even when they occurred outside of its time period."
2369,law,"my main source of background information was scholar shahla haeri's law of desire: temporary marriage in shi'i iran, which includes interviews with contemporary practitioners and provides a detailed portrait of this complex and unusual institution."
2370,where,"in cases where i thought it was necessary for the novel, i adapted the original stories freely."
2371,inside,"women’s enews is delighted she regularly shares her insights and inside knowledge with its readers.” – rita henley jensen, editor in chief women’s enews, new york “this is essential reading on iran, and feminism, human rights, and social movements."
2372,where,"every reasonable effort has been made to assess the identification and source of those images displayed throughout this book, and they are included for the reader’s reference and information where the same has been ascertained."

2375,liberty,"chapter one veil of half-truths  it is difficult to find many bright spots in the lives of persian women.… their liberty of movement, of action, and of speech is curtailed.… in the prevailing social condition … they could not do anything unless [they were] helped by men.… but some of the women maintain, and i agree with them, that their wisest plan is to go ahead and show what they can do."
2376,question,nina ansary so much of this was unknown to me.… reader’s comment on nina ansary’s facebook page  the historical narrative of the “woman question” in iran is an intricate labyrinth.
2377,establishment,"misconception 1: before the pahlavi monarchy, persian suppressed by the religious and political establishment."
2378,power,"women  were  always  in the story accepted by many, persian women are depicted as unceasingly under the power of male authority."
2379,authority,the authority and independence of women were part of the accepted social system.
2380,freedom,"thus, in some ways these thirteenth- and fourteenth-century women had more freedom than women who lived hundreds of years later."
2381,freedom,misconception 2: iranian women didn’t advocate for their freedom until recently.
2382,seclusion,"amidst an austere environment in which the reigning presence of islam continued to dictate the seclusion and subservience of the female population, a handful of progressive-minded women began to courageously challenge the principles of a patriarchal order, founding schools for girls as well as women’s periodicals advocating greater female participation in society."
2383,freedom,"the pahlavi era undoubtedly ushered in progressive change in iranian society, including policies that brought about modern dress, education for girls, women’s increased participation in society, more freedom of the press (including women’s magazines), and the enfranchisement of women."
2384,injustice,"there is also a more encouraging phenomenon: progressive religious groups are bridging the gap between religious and nonreligious thinkers by forming coalitions to combat injustice, poverty, and violence against women."
2385,building,women in iran are building such bridges due to their common belief in women’s rights.
2386,freedom,"while some may not use the word feminist, they agree that women deserve equal rights and freedom from oppressive yet sanctioned practices."
2387,question,"while some would label it heresy, many traditional muslim women are posing a radically earnest question: could a reinterpretation of passages in the koran that are used to justify the inferior position of women be a means to women’s emancipation?"
2388,where,"today, in a country where the islamic regime continues to debilitate women in almost every aspect of society, iranian women are forging ahead as part of a vibrant, inclusive movement."
2389,freedom,"sadiqeh dowlatabadi (1882–1961), early pioneer of women’s rights in iran  the insistent cry for women’s freedom has been heard for centuries in iran."
2390,case,"while that may seem to be the case for women striving for equality in iran and elsewhere, when the powers that be push against women’s objectives, it is possible to employ the knowledge of the past to invigorate the forward stride toward progress."
2391,freedom,"more recent voices of heroic women like tahirah and sadiqeh dowlatabadi validate the truth that even with clipped wings, those who passionately seek freedom never abandon the will to fly."
2392,where,"zoroaster’s teachings emphasized an egalitarian creed, not only where men and women were concerned, but also with regard to rich and poor, young and old."
2393,law,"its sacred text, the avesta (book of the law) was compiled over centuries and was completed during the sassanid dynasty (ad 226–641)."
2394,justice,"daughter of khosrow parviz ii, king of the sassanian empire (590– 628), pourandokht, who preached egalitarianism, wrote in a letter to her troops: “a monarch, regardless of being queen or king must defend his or her land and treat the people with justice.” her sister, azarmidokht sassanid, was the second empress of persia (630–631)."
2395,law,"the wife of general aryasb (achaemenid’s arteshbod), she played an important role in maintaining law and order in babylonia after the conquest of the neo-babylonian empire in 547 bc by cyrus the great."
2396,authority,"one such individual was a successful landowner in 488 bc known as irdabama, who oversaw a flourishing wine and grain business that employed a large workforce.6 she was only one of a number of accomplished businesswomen in ancient persia whose achievements provide evidence of an equal social system that accepted the authority and independence of women."
2397,authority,"it took many years for the religion to spread throughout the vast persian empire; however, islam clearly emphasized strengthening and safeguarding the family unit by assigning guardianship and authority to the male head of the household.7 thus, women’s roles were severely restricted."
2398,inside,"women and men were also socially separated both inside and outside of the household.8 with regard to educational policy, the principal form of elementary education was the maktab (elementary school) system."
2399,criminal,"this is partially due to the personal convictions of genghis khan (1162–1227), who elevated the status of women by having his own daughters play a crucial role in his empire.14 in his book the secret history of the mongol queens: how the daughters of genghis khan rescued his empire, author jack weatherford writes about the impact and legacy of genghis khan’s daughters and other mongol queens: the royal mongol women raced horses, commanded in war, presided as judges in criminal cases, ruled vast territories, and sometimes wrestled men in public sporting competitions."
2400,seclusion,"they arrogantly rejected the customs of civilized women of neighboring cultures, such as wearing the veil or hiding in seclusion.15 the new order didn’t last forever, and persian women were again forced to comply with patriarchal restrictions."
2401,state,"in 1501, shah ismail i became the first ruler of the islamic safavid dynasty (1501–1722), and shiia islam was declared the official state religion."
2402,state,"in their quest to transform a primarily sunni tradition, safavid monarchs imported ulama (clergy) from arab-speaking countries to enforce a shiite juridical system.16 the declaration of shiism as the official state religion granted clerical authority over all public and private matters."
2403,state,the ruling dynasties legitimized their right to rule by claiming that they were the representatives of the hidden imam on earth.17 state and clergy thus became effectively interconnected.
2404,state,"monarchs were obligated to pay homage and often defer to the high-ranking shiite clergy in all matters of the state, as they needed them as a source of legitimacy for their right to rule."
2405,power,"in their enhanced position of power, the clergy now determined the role and rights of women."
2406,state,"the newly established clergy-state alliance mandated a patriarchal order that included veiling, early marriage, polygamy, and the seclusion of women.18 while both sunni and shiites19 viewed women as inferior, the advent of state-sanctioned shiite islam implanted into the society at large the notion that women were subordinate to men."
2407,seclusion,"the document represents shiite thought on all aspects of life, including family law, the status of women, and the need for women’s veiling and seclusion."
2408,confinement,"female confinement to the home continued under succeeding rulers, including the qajar dynasty, which reigned from 1785 until 1925."
2409,where,where were the voices of change within iran?
2410,where,"upon marrying her cousin at the age of fourteen, she moved to karbala, iraq, where she pursued the teachings of shaykh ahmad al-ahsa’i, a philosopher and religious thinker, and his successor, siyyid kazim-i rashti."
2411,sharia,"some remained faithful to established sharia or islamic law; others, including the bab, wanted a radical break with islam and incorporated egalitarian values into their belief system."
2412,executed,it was not long afterward that the government crushed the babi movement and executed the bab.
2413,arrest,tahirah was placed under house arrest and put to death in 1852.
2414,death,"revered by members of the baha’i faith, the religion that succeeded the babi movement after her death, tahirah is remembered as an important spiritual figure, a martyr for the babi cause and for women’s emancipation.23 considered the first suffrage martyr in iran, tahirah’s revolutionary spirit is hauntingly captured in her final words prior to her strangulation with a silk scarf: “you can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.”24  a thorn aimed at women sometimes the most powerful statements of protest are uttered with an incisive sense of satire and wit."
2415,court,"i did not like the book; i threw it aside.… i wrote a book in answer to this evil-natured man, so that men would know that among women there are still those who are of high standing  and whose force of speech may benefit from their eloquence.25 while ta’deeb al-nesvan may have been written by an anonymous man, it is rumored to have been penned by one of the princes of the qajar court, “who must have feared his wife so greatly that he has not had the courage to put his name on it as its author.” the following provides a short summary of the main recommendations of his book aimed at the “edification” of women: 1."
2416,law,"she ran the school from her home, providing a formal education to young girls with classes in reading, writing, arithmetic, history, law, religion, geography, and cookery."
2417,freedom,"a witness to the stultifying lack of freedom that taj described, american missionary clara colliver rice spoke poignantly of the plight of iranian women in the early 1900s."
2418,seclusion,"the seclusion and swaddling of her life has been a religious command and a political policy, and the wastage of a nation’s greatest asset has kept persia in a backwater.31 she goes on to observe: mercifully, many of them do not realize this and even look upon their veils as protection and a privilege.32  colliver rice also commented here as well on the lack of educational opportunity for females: education, like everything else … has been controlled by islam, whose prophet said in regards to girls, “do not teach them the art of writing.” … a common adage in iran is that a woman who is taught to write is like a serpent who is given poison to drink."
2419,freedom,"and yet they signaled early signs of opposition to an imposed social order that deprived women of a formal education, political participation, and their overall freedom."
2420,power,"one of today’s most prominent women’s rights advocates, guity nashat, commented on the struggles of women from that earlier era: the greatest obstacle to removing the injustices from which women suffered was their ignorance.… devoting their energies to enlightening iranian women, they began their efforts by opening schools, and hoped that a good education would teach the younger generation of women to use their minds and not waste their intelligence in the pursuit of men.34 in fact, a growing number of persian women—dedicated and tenacious activists—were unleashing their power as they began to organize, educate, and publish."
2421,sexism,"at a time when women were not even allowed to walk in the streets after certain hours in various parts of the capital,35 a handful of progressive women realized that education was an essential ingredient if females were to succeed in breaking through the barriers of sexism and patriarchy."
2422,question,"gowharshenas opened the school without her husband’s knowledge, and when he found out, he posed this rhetorical question to her: in the next world, when your father asks me why i let his daughter participate in activities contrary to religion and virtue, what shall i say?39 mahrokh gowharshenas’s husband’s remarks aside, it is important to note that the progressive efforts by persian women, which included opening schools for girls and other advocacy activities, enjoyed the support of a number of progressive-minded and intellectual men, as well as like-minded women."
2423,seclusion,"girls were to be taught only household chores, and adult women were expected to remain in seclusion."
2424,establishment,"undaunted by the establishment, dowlatabadi opened another school specifically for poor girls, called ummulmadares."
2425,pen,"[women] took up the pen to free iran, to save our forsaken daughters and to help our nation."
2426,freedom,[women] are not only unafraid to die but [women] consider it as an honor to make sacrifices for the good of the country and [women’s] freedom.
2427,dictatorship,"down with the dictatorship and the enemies of iran.41 not surprisingly, the publication faced strong opposition from mullahs in isfahan.42 having cast women in a subservient role for centuries, their patriarchal culture was not about to change."
2428,authorities,"when it came to their attention that sadiqeh’s magazine was publishing articles by and for women, and that schools were being established to educate girls, the authorities recognized a new women’s movement being born in their midst, and they did not hesitate before shutting them down."
2429,where,"43 in 1922, she moved to paris, where she received her ba at the sorbonne and wrote articles for european women’s publications.44 studying abroad was not a common practice even among iranian men in those days; for a young woman, it was audacious."
2430,establishment,their activist perspective was viewed as a flagrant violation of the islamic establishment and its ordained code of morality.
2431,imprisonment,"riots, threats, and even arrests and imprisonment often resulted."
2432,confinement,"nameh-ye banovan (women’s letter, 1920), edited by shahnaz azad, ceased publication after only three days, presumably for publishing the following statement in its inaugural issue: the shroud of superstition and traditional confinement have blocked the vision of men and women in this country.…48 the magazine was permitted back on the scene only after it agreed to print a retraction clarifying that the word “shroud” did not in any way signify the veil."
2433,imprisoned,"nevertheless, azad and her husband were harassed, arrested, and even imprisoned until the magazine was ultimately shut down."
2434,power,"throughout this period of iranian women’s drive toward emancipation, the power of the pen had a potent effect on those who were able to obtain the groundbreaking publications."
2435,taken,another important path toward securing women’s rights was that taken by women’s societies or anjomans.
2436,repression,"among the most prominent organizations of the day were the women’s freedom society (anjoman-e azadi-ye zanan, 1906), the national ladies society (anjoman-e mokhadarat-e vatan, 1910), and the patriotic women’s league (jamiat-e nesvan-e vatankhah, 1922).49 author eliz sanasarian relates in her book the women’s rights movement in iran: mutiny, appeasement, and repression from 1900 to khomeini that “since most of these organizations and societies operated in secrecy there is little information about them.” however, she does offer the following intriguing and inspiring specifics."
2437,freedom,the women’s freedom society was created to address the second-class status of women.
2438,freedom,"a group of men soon disrupted the meeting, the members were forced to flee, and the women’s freedom society was disbanded."
2439,establishment,"the patriotic women’s league, a well-known radical organization in tehran, had as its objectives the schooling of young girls, the education of women, the protection of orphan girls, and the establishment of hospitals for poor women.50 they published a magazine called patriotic women, which dealt with the issues of women’s rights, social reform, the dangers of early marriage, and nationalizing the nation’s industries."
2440,authority,"as foreign dominance over iran’s resources grew, some members of the bureaucratic elite and some religious elite demanded a curb on royal authority."
2441,court,(it was even rumored that women of the royal court refused to serve their husband’s water pipes!)
2442,seclusion,the constitutionalist cause became a fortuitous opportunity for females to come out of seclusion and into the public sphere.
2443,liberty,"in his reception hall they confronted him, and lest he and his colleagues should doubt their meaning, these cloistered mothers, wives and daughters exhibited threateningly their revolvers, tore aside their veils, and confessed their decision to kill their own husbands and sons, and leave behind their own dead bodies, if the deputies wavered in their duty to uphold the liberty and dignity of the persian people and nation.54 although the constitution of 1906 failed to stipulate any rights or entitlements for women, women played a significant role in its acceptance."
2444,power,"[they are] the weaker sex, and do not have the same power of judgment that men have.55  what would sadiqeh say?"
2445,question,"the reader posed this pointed question: “what would sadiqeh dowlatabadi say today about the treatment of women in ‘modern’ persia?” as someone who was in the vanguard of women’s advocacy in early twentieth century iran, sadiqeh’s valued perspective would certainly be enlightening."
2446,freedom,"their aspirations still resonate with those seeking freedom and equality for the women of iran, and it is likely that sadiqeh might advise today’s activists to keep up the fight!"
2447,establishment,"in 1921, reza khan, a relatively unknown commander in the persian cossack brigade,2 staged a coup that deposed ahmad shah, the last king of the qajar dynasty, and in 1925 led to the establishment of the pahlavi monarchy."
2448,power,"we will explore the multitude of drastic changes that took place over the fifty-plus years that the pahlavis were in power— profound and noble changes that benefited many, yet had unintended negative repercussions for others."
2449,power,"educating girls the modern way on the eve of reza shah’s rise to power, iran’s education system was manifestly inadequate, and adherence to religious codes of conduct meant that iranian women remained second-class citizens.3 the discovery of oil in the early twentieth century added considerably to iran’s economy, enabling the inauguration of numerous socio-economic and structural improvements."
2450,power,"the first decade of pahlavi rule witnessed the dilution of british and russian power; the enactment of drastic reforms, including secularization and centralization; development of education along western lines; and expansion of women’s role in society.4 a fundamental component of the regime’s monumental task of departing from centuries of religious domination entailed secularizing and restructuring the country’s education system— a daring excursion into new territory."
2451,state,"only 50,000 students were enrolled in state-run and private institutions."
2452,state,"in addition, the 1906 education act providing free and compulsory education through the sixth grade remained unenforced; state regulations for instructor qualification were practically nonexistent; higher education was significantly underdeveloped; and the antiquated maktab (religious schools) system still prevailed."
2453,law,"with the momentous new law, iran became the second muslim nation, preceded only by turkey, to officially ban this traditional female garment.11 girls were also banned from wearing the chador (an ankle-length shroud) and the head scarf in school, punishable by withholding diplomas for all pupils, while instructors who wore the head scarf or veil could lose salaries.12 this profound departure from centuries of ingrained tradition was viewed by reza shah to be a fundamental prerequisite in facilitating female inclusion into modern society."
2454,law,"vehemently opposed to the new unveiling law, religious families thus kept their daughters at home."
2455,police,"while the police were ordered not to resort to violence in getting women to remove their veils in public, there were occasional instances of authorities resorting to beating a woman or removing her veil by force."
2456,state,"requesting that they appear without the hijab at the 1936 graduation ceremony of the women’s teacher training college in tehran, reza shah admitted: this is the hardest thing i have ever had to do, but i must ask you to serve as an example for other persian women.16 historians maintain that “while reaction to the state’s coercive measure differed from class to class and region to region,” unveiling became “in the mind so of many iranians, the point of women’s awakening and the cause of their resentment towards reza shah.”17 ironically, this seemingly liberating measure had the opposite effect for a large segment of the female population that was unaccustomed to going out in public without the proper head covering."
2457,seclusion,"stifled by this new policy, they remained in seclusion, relying instead on their fathers, husbands, and sons."
2458,law,"while the unveiling law resulted in many iranian girls being kept out of school by their parents, others were able to benefit from the expanding educational opportunities afforded by the pahlavi regime."
2459,establishment,"the inauguration of new schools for girls, coeducational facilities, and the teacher training college, along with the extension of primary schooling and technical and vocational institutions, were instrumental in the push toward expanding educational opportunities for women.18 by 1935, despite unrelenting prejudice by the religious establishment, an official decree by the ministry of education led to the increased presence of young women in academia."
2460,establishment,"the education for girls is an important duty (“vazife”) of the government, which is likely to launch iran on the path to westernization and progress (“tarraqi”).20  too much, too soon not surprisingly, there were objections from the orthodox establishment against the campaign for female literacy, prompting the speaker of the parliament to declare: women’s studies should be in line with the tasks they are supposed to perform in society."
2461,establishment,"we should teach them cooking and sewing instead.21 there was no denying that a majority of the traditional population, as well as the clerical establishment, resented such drastic changes."
2462,power,"the clergy were not only deprived of their stronghold in the school system, but many of the newly established secular laws reduced their overall power in the academic sector after centuries of control."
2463,legal codes,exacerbating matters was the introduction of legal codes based on european models.
2464,state,"for example, the enactment of the marriage law (qanun-e ezdevaj) of 1931, mandating compulsory registration of marriage and divorce in state notary offices, limited jurisdiction of the clergy in judicial matters.22 such revolutionary measures led author nikki keddie to conclude, “rapid modernization from above helped create two cultures in iran, which became more acute in later decades.”23 for the first time since the advent of the safavid dynasty in the sixteenth century, the relationship between the monarchy and the clerical establishment was strained."
2465,case,"given the country’s religious backbone and deep adherence to faith, the new pahlavi policies were definitely a case of too much, too soon."
2466,case,"this [in turn] implied reducing the influence of the ulama (clergy) in all spheres of life and confining them to matters of faith and ritual, similar to that customary in the christian west at the time.”24 in fact, the following statement by reza shah’s son and successor, mohammad reza pahlavi, provides support for menashri’s assessment: “[he] never advocated a complete break with the past; he pushed the clergy into the background because at the time many of them were hindering the country’s progress.”25 as is often the case when swift and radical change rocks the boat, not everyone wants to remain on board."
2467,seclusion,"[they] emerged from the social layers that identified with general notions of social progress and modernization associated with european civilization and endorsed by the modernists and reformers of the constitutionalist movement.…27  spreading the word as part of the regime’s overall objective of bringing women out of centuries of seclusion and into mainstream society, formal education was essential."
2468,power,a number of independent women’s publications flourished in the immediate aftermath of reza shah’s rise to power.
2469,state,"alam-e nesvan (women’s universe, 1920–1934) was the frontrunner in supporting the state’s female agenda."
2470,law,"today, we have a government that listens to sensible argument and protects women and children.28 in fact, in 1931 the new marriage law stipulated that the minimum marriage age would be increased from thirteen to fifteen— which may not seem wildly significant to twenty-firstcentury westerners, but it signaled progress in 1930s iran."
2471,state,alam’s reference to illegally marrying off a child to an old man highlights the publication’s support for the state’s progressive agenda for women and its belief that reza shah’s regime was proceeding in the right direction.
2472,freedom,"the author of that article spoke out: a group of people including myself believe that the removal of the chador [veil] will not create freedom nor will hejab [veil] prevent moral corruption.…29  in 1935, kanoon-e banovan (ladies center) was established."
2473,power,"once reza shah was firmly in power, women’s independent activities were curbed and by royal command directed and regulated into a single organization."
2474,war,"education will steer the ship reza shah’s son and successor, mohammad reza pahlavi, came to power in 1941—after the invasion of allied forces during world war ii—and continued “the vigorous reform program inaugurated by his father.”32 in reality, the monumental reforms instigated by reza shah had primarily impacted the urban population, and only a predominantly cultured, progressiveminded and privileged few had been able to capitalize on the new employment and educational opportunities."
2475,war,"the extraordinary reign of mohammad reza pahlavi was characterized by rapid urbanization, banning of the communist tudeh party33 in iran, nationalization of iranian oil, development of a modern military, expansion of the existing  educational infrastructure, and considerable reforms for women.34 the devastation of world war ii had led the shah to seek assistance from the united states, which as part of the allied war effort had begun to take a more active role in alleviating the ravages of a damaged nation.35 the post-war phase additionally resulted in the temporary revival of british involvement in iran, which had significantly subsided toward the end of qajar rule."
2476,mining,"38 the plan, which included programs in health, agriculture, education, mining, and oil production, was an instant failure due to the shortage of funds, administrative constraints, and political disruptions."
2477,building,"this plan combined investment programs with forecasts in the public and private sector and specific tasks for ministerial and government agencies, in addition to a twenty-year collaborative program with international experts providing specialized attention in the field of education.40 in the fourth national development plan (1968–1972), qualitative enhancements and structural changes outlined in the “principles” and “objectives” of education specified compatibility of this infrastructure with “modern scientific and educational progress and the requirements of modern times.”41 a significant component of this agenda entailed specialized teacher training programs for girls, specifically since “the total number of girls in iranian schools did not exceed 1/3 of the total number of pupils.” it effectively led to reduced illiteracy and an increase in the number of students at the primary and secondary levels.42 the pahlavi era’s fifth national development plan (1973– 1978), was enacted during a decade when the quadrupling of oil prices enabled a widening of the scope of educational and social development, including “trained manpower, equalizing opportunities between the rich and poor, raising the levels of female education, and expanding research to eradicate illiteracy,” along with a forecasted projection of a “sixth plan” for “increasing the country’s educational system, utilizing foreign professionals and experts, expansion of educational buildings, and improvements in educational standards,” which paved the way for “higher education to respond more rapidly to the country’s requirements.”43 in the art of “nation building,” analysts and economists “regard education as an investment rather than a consumer item."
2478,term,"as one of the most important sectors of social services, education is highly regarded as a long-term investment, catering to the needs of a society.”44 shortly after ascending the throne, the shah declared “only education could steer the national ship (kashti-ye vatan) toward the shores of progress (sahel-e tarraqi).”45 to that end, in 1943 the government ratified a law providing free and compulsory education for all citizens."
2479,state,"the department of research and curriculum planning worked in partnership with a team of american advisors to modify all elementary and secondary programs, enabling students to learn a variety of skills in conjunction with the set curriculum.47 brigham young university, utah state agricultural college, and the university of nebraska developed extensive agricultural programs throughout the country and in the process created a system of movable tent schools for the nomadic tribal population."

2482,war,"according to official government statistics, during the 1950s only 17 percent of villages had schools, and out of the 10 percent of girls between the ages of twelve and eighteen attending secondary schools, the vast majority were concentrated in tehran.54 the shah therefore came to the conclusion that “no basic solution to the country’s educational problems was possible by ordinary methods; and [in order] to transform these circumstances, rapid and effective war on illiteracy by revolutionary and unusual means was necessary.…”55 in 1962, the white revolution (enqelab-e sefid) was launched."
2483,industrial,"this multidimensional package of policy guidelines, designed to facilitate the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy, was viewed by the shah as “essentially an iranian revolution compatible with the spirit and tradition of the iranian people.”56 although land reform was the principal objective of these new policy guidelines, a primary feature was the enfranchisement of women."
2484,captivity,"the shah believed that this decree would “free women of their age-long captivity, and put an end to a social disgrace [which is] contrary to the real spirit of islam.”57 he justified his decision to give women the right to vote with these powerful words: how can a man give rights to himself yet deprive his mother and sister of the same rights?"
2485,serving,"literacy advocates included in the shah’s white revolution package were free and compulsory education for children of all ages and the establishment of the literacy, health, and reconstruction development corps, whose mission was to improve the quality of life throughout the provinces, raise productivity, eradicate illiteracy, and facilitate the transition from an outdated system to a market economy.59 the literacy corps (sepah-e danesh), designed to combat rampant illiteracy in rural areas, was composed of male urban middle class high school graduates who were given the option of serving as instructors in lieu of a two-year mandatory military service."
2486,state,"although the corps became instrumental in the pahlavi regime’s quest to reduce illiteracy and establish a modern nation state, it proved incapable of altering the conventional religious mind-set of a large segment of the population."
2487,authority,"despite the fact that government statistics reflected increased educational facilities and enrollment, a considerable number of families beholden to traditional norms continued to feel that it was inappropriate to send girls over the age of ten or eleven to schools that had by then become predominantly coeducational.61 aware of this reality, corps members resorted to various strategies, ranging from koranic recitations and daily prayers to the separation of boys and girls in the classroom, but to no avail.62 during what effectively constituted an era of unprecedented transformation, the implementation of new measures increasingly provoked the wrath of the clergy who regarded such trespasses on their authority as unconstitutional and a violation of the principles of sharia."
2488,where,"in direct contrast to rural areas, the impact of radical educational reform became exceedingly apparent among the urban female population, where the percentage of girls attending primary school increased from 34 percent in 1966 to 42 percent in 1977.63 the move toward adopting a more western philosophy within the academic system required revisions in primary and secondary textbooks."
2489,term,"socialization is a term used by sociologists, anthropologists, social psychologists and other professionals to refer to the process by which an individual learns the norms, customs, and ideologies that will provide her or him with the skills and habits necessary for participating in his or her particular society."
2490,term,"the term gender ideology refers to attitudes regarding the appropriate and expected roles and obligations of men and women in a given society, which are often reflective of the doctrines of the ruling regime.69 a “traditional” gender ideology emphasizes the distinctive roles assigned to both sexes based on presumed innate differences, with men as breadwinners and women as homemakers and principal caregivers within the family unit."
2491,custody,"the 1967 family protection act meant increased autonomy for women and the removal of restrictions in marriage, divorce, and child custody matters."
2492,civil rights,her book provides an enlightening narrative of the challenges entailed in transforming an entrenched way of life and the instrumental role played by the princess in this process: this act gave iran’s women the most sweeping civil rights in the islamic middle east.

2496,law,"this is the first time that iranian law has even recognized that iranian women have any dignity, let alone agreed to ‘protect’ it.”  by the time of the revolution, we had almost complete equality with men, at least in the eyes of the law."
2497,law,"there were more areas that still needed work: one was the law governing inheritance, the second was the law that required a wife to obtain her husband’s permission whenever she wanted to travel outside of the country."
2498,guard,"resistance to change came from a fear that we could have a rash of “runaway wives,” though i argued long and hard that it was much more important to guard against “runaway husbands,” who were, in most families, the major breadwinners."
2499,punishment,"the final item on our agenda was the elimination of article 179 of the penal code, which allowed a man to escape punishment if he killed his wife in a situation where he believed she had been guilty of adultery."
2500,sentencing,"this law had been so liberally interpreted in the past, that a brother had once escaped sentencing for killing his sister— because he saw her getting into a taxi with a man."
2501,allegedly,"at that point, the shah left the country, allegedly for medical reasons.82 in 1953, mossadegh’s government was indeed overthrown in a military coup d’état."

2504,officers,"a forceful advocate for equal rights, this organization was instrumental in employing women as judges, mayors, cabinet officers, and diplomats."
2505,state,as for women’s publications: the two major state-sanctioned women’s publications of the pahlavi era represented the regime’s vision of the westernized-emancipated iranian woman.
2506,state,"officially sanctioned by the state, both of these competing periodicals essentially avoided national politics."
2507,law,"in contrast, ettela’at-e banovan offered its readers articles not only about career and educational opportunities but also family law, social reforms, and accomplished women in iran and abroad—including well-known athletes, lawyers, pilots, scientists, and physicians."
2508,freedom,"the magazine’s focus on significant topics was exemplified as well through its editorials, such as “women’s rights in iran,” “the success of iranian female students in america,” “women factory employees,” and “women and freedom in iran.” there were also articles that showcased the achievements and challenges of women in other parts of the world, including “uganda’s first female minister,” “what our muslim sisters are doing,” and “women rule in  the united states of america.” while ettela’at-e banovan occasionally published recipes and fashion spreads, its overall content was geared toward encouraging women’s participation in society at large."

2512,sharia,the 1979 islamic revolution spearheaded by khomeini ushered in a theocracy that dismantled the progressive agenda of the pahlavi era and instituted a constitution that stipulated governance according to the precepts of sharia (islamic law).
2513,case,this was particularly the case for traditional women who felt alienated and disconnected from the pahlavis’ visionary yet disruptive policies that had favored the adoption of a western lifestyle.
2514,war,how did the iran-iraq war inadvertently lead to women’s empowerment?
2515,sharia,"a scholar and teacher who wrote extensively on islamic law and philosophy, he was an advocate of strict adherence to sharia—a position that attracted many adherents."
2516,where,"although khomeini was exiled in 1964 to najaf, iraq, he continued his efforts against the shah’s government from abroad, where his rhetoric centered on the premise that the pahlavi monarchy was a pagan institution (taqut) incompatible with the true nature of islam."
2517,state,khomeini’s followers continued to grow as he established himself in iraq and devised a plan of action for launching an islamic state.
2518,state,"during his years in exile, he formulated his doctrine of clerical rule (velayat-e-faqih), in which he maintained justification within islamic doctrine for creating an islamic state in the absence of an iman (an infallible successor to the prophet muhammad."
2519,institution,"and so it was in paris that the groundwork for a full-blown revolution was solidified.4 khomeini’s sermons reflecting his vision of an “islamic utopia” and a return to cultural authenticity via shiism had mass appeal that would ultimately overturn the pahlavi regime.5 by 1979, large-scale social and political discontent brought about the dissolution of the monarchy and the institution of ayatollah khomeini’s islamic republic of iran."
2520,court,"in her memoir, ebadi explains her initial attraction—and that of many other like-minded women—to khomeini’s rhetoric: faith occupied a central role in our middle-class lives.… who did i have more in common with, in the end: an opposition led by the mullahs who spoke in the tones familiar to ordinary iranians or the gilded court of the shah, whose officials cavorted with american starlets at parties soaked in expensive french champagne?"
2521,state,"by appealing to disparate groups that opposed the shah, khomeini ultimately succeeded in reinstituting a clergy-state alliance.15 and as for the patronage provided by women, it seems that many may have been misled by khomeini’s early pronouncements."
2522,power,"any nation that has women like the women of iran will surely be victorious.16 and in an interview given to a german publication in that same year, he further declared: in an islamic republic, women have complete freedom in everything they do, just as men are free—in everything.17 in a correspondence with the guardian newspaper in paris, khomeini again reiterated: women are free in the islamic republic—in the selection of their activities, in their future, and their clothing … 18 however, once in power, ayatollah khomeini radically shifted from his previously stated views, proclaiming to italian journalist orianna fallaci: the women who contributed to the revolution were and are in islamic dress, not elegant women at all, made up like you, who go around dragging behind the tail of men."
2523,freedom,and yet his earlier statements seemed to promise an islamic republic in which women would “have complete freedom in everything they do.” were these pronouncements mere public relations—meant to pacify potential critics and entice women to join in his revolutionary movement?
2524,freedom,"in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, it became quite obvious that the ayatollah’s assertions regarding women’s promised “freedom” represented nothing more than a disingenuous platform to amass support."
2525,serving,"stripped of her judgeship, as islamic law prohibits women from serving as judges, she expressed her misconceptions about the revolution she had initially supported: it took scarcely a month for me to realize that, in fact, i had willingly and enthusiastically participated in my own demise."
2526,authority,"i was a woman, and this revolution demanded my defeat … my naiveté astounds me.21  a new and virtuous order with his triumphant comeback on february 1, 1979, the ayatollah designated himself iran’s supreme leader, a position incorporated into the constitution and regarded as the highest political and religious authority of the nation."
2527,sharia,"now the country would be governed according to the principles of islamic law, thus ushering in “a new and virtuous order” in which secular affairs would conform to divine mandates.22 sharia law would replace secular law in every sphere of life: political, social, judicial, and economic."
2528,transferred,a significant part of the economy would be transferred from private to government hands.
2529,state,"and the state under the islamic republic  would dictate the standards of morality—from attire to family life to music.23 the regime’s outlook toward the west, and america in particular, was reflected in its declarations against the “great satan” accompanied by the slogan “death to america” (marg bar amrika).24 the initial phase of the new administration was characterized by rapid islamization, reinforcing patriarchal mandates within a legalized framework."
2530,retribution,"these decrees included the abolition of the family protection laws; reduction of the minimum marriage age to thirteen (changed in 1991 to fifteen); reinstitution of islamic retribution laws (qesas) stipulating that the “blood money” (diyeh) for women is half that of men, as is their share of inheritance; and reinstitution of temporary marriage (sigheh).25 the practice of temporary marriage involves a valid contract that allows a couple to get married for anywhere from a few minutes to as long as ninety-nine years."
2531,where,"in the preamble to the constitution, the separateness of “male” and “female” attributes was highlighted specifically where the previous regime strove to omit such distinctions: the family is the fundamental unit of society and the main center for the growth and edification of human beings.… the view of the family unit delivers women from being regarded as an object or instrument in the service of promoting consumerism and exploitation."
2532,establishment,"in other words, women are ensured their rights, as long as those rights conform to the dictates of the patriarchal religious establishment."
2533,establishment,all of these laws were instigated for the purpose of redirecting women into what the clerical establishment saw as a female’s “primary role in society: domestic responsibility.”31  the inhibiting/liberating veil the most visible change initiated in the immediate aftermath of the revolution was that all women were now required to wear the veil (hijab or head covering) in public.
2534,law,"although his son abandoned the enforcement of this law, a majority of the country’s conservative population continued to be resentful of the trend toward a westernized dress code during the pahlavi era."
2535,servitude,"while restoration of the veil under the islamic regime was shunned as an emblem of servitude by secular women, it was initially enthusiastically embraced by a large segment of women from traditional backgrounds."
2536,confinement,"slowly, it became fashionable for the daughters of traditional families to attend college.32 ebadi goes on to explain the manner in which imposition of this decree paradoxically empowered women who, despite rampant discrimination, became more active in public life: the islamic republic had inadvertently championed traditional women.… for they had been given a new awareness of their rights, but only crude tools to advance them.33 for the conservative segment of the female population, the veil did not signify either confinement or a repressive ideology; rather, it was an empowering garment that enabled them to break through previously impermeable boundaries."
2537,freedom,the veil!” as those on the right chant “freedom!
2538,freedom,freedom!
2539,freedom,freedom!” satrapi’s caption reads: “everywhere in the streets there were demonstrations for and against the veil!
2540,term,they brainwash our youth.37 the term “westoxication” derives from the title of a well-known book written in the early 1960s by iranian intellectual and author jalal al-i ahmad entitled occidentosis: a plague from the west.
2541,term,"renowned for coining the term gharbzadegi (westoxication), the author critiqued the west, stressing the loss of cultural identity and the contradictions arising from rapid westernization in iranian society."
2542,establishment,"education is not just a social necessity, but a holy duty.48 by 1984, the council for the cultural revolution, renamed the supreme council for the cultural revolution (sccr, shoray-e enqelab-e farhangi) and described as “the highest body for making policies and decisions in connection with all cultural, educational, and research activities within the framework of the general policies of the system,” had evolved to having seventeen members with over twenty satellite institutions.49 headed by the country’s president and accountable only to the supreme leader, this entity was composed of highranking shiite clerics and powerful government figures, as well as the women’s social and cultural council (wscc), the republic’s first organization on women’s affairs, established in 1988 within the sccr to ensure conformity with islamic principles for the female population at large.50 in compliance with the regime’s mandates, the council guaranteed “gender appropriateness” within academia by prohibiting married women from studying abroad unless accompanied by their husbands and restricting their enrollment in a variety of typically maleoriented disciplines, including mining, technology, animal husbandry, and agriculture.51 these restrictions adhered to the guidelines for gender instruction prescribed in the principles of the system of education decreed by the ministry of education, placing “education for girls and women” within the framework of “recognizing the identity of women and their roles within the family and society on the basis of islam” and “planning for the content and method of her schooling accordingly.”52 the plan additionally stipulated that the educational guidance of girls should be based on their capabilities and interests, and their vocational guidance should take into consideration the kind of occupations needed by and best fulfilled by women given their role and responsibility within the family … with curriculum development emphasizing the sanctity and stability of the family by introducing the different role of men and women in marital life.53 the educational ideology of the republic stood in stark contrast to that of the pahlavi regime, wherein educational objectives avoided gender-specific formulations and were stipulated in the context of “providing equal opportunity for all iranian men and women, in all classes of the population, urban or rural.”54 the moral educational goals were additionally specified within the framework of cultivating “human qualities and virtues inspired by spiritual principles, while making judicious use of social rights … [as] members of a free and progressive society.”55 a delineation of religious instruction was noticeably absent within the defined objectives and ethos of the pahlavi educational establishment."
2543,state,"what is puzzling here is that for unspecified reasons, the state chose to retain the infrastructure created by the pahlavi regime—one that was facilitated by a team of western advisers."
2544,building,"in referring to this miscalculation, author david menashri estimates that this unusual course of action indicates that the republic had “inherited a working institution … which was readily available for [its] use.”56 an alternate explanation for this significant oversight could simply be a lack of expertise in the art of nation-building by the architects of a newly conceived islamic empire."
2545,conviction,"in the aftermath of the revolution, khomeini continued his gender-biased sermons, which combined with the already enumerated directives concerning the female population at large, point to his overriding conviction that female education must be compatible with women’s “role” and “responsibility” within the family."
2546,authority,"author parvin paidar concludes that the regime was confident that their traditional gender policies would work to consolidate women’s continuous support.57 there is no doubt that ayatollah khomeini regarded education as means to cultivate the ideal person (ensanha-ye nemuneh), and that this would be accomplished through transformation of the educational system into “training” (tarbiyyat) institutions.58 it was his intention that female education instill in future mothers the proper knowledge to raise  children according to the ideals of the ruling authority."
2547,building,"the regime meant to “cleanse” all educational content of its “westoxicated” ideology, but did they overlook an important building block of the educational infrastructure?"
2548,where,"although the few studies done on post-revolutionary elementary textbooks have noted the insertion of religious content, research concerning identity formation by way of a revised elementary curriculum remained relatively unexplored, specifically where it applied to longterm implications for the female population at large."
2549,term,"in examining both text and illustrations in the elementary textbooks (grades 1–5) of the republican era, specific attention was given to gender ideology—a term referring to attitudes regarding the appropriate, expected roles and obligations of men and women in a given society.64 a “traditional” gender ideology emphasizes the distinctive roles assigned to both sexes based on presumed differences, with men fulfilling their primary duty as breadwinners, and women as homemakers and principal caregivers within the family unit."
2550,building,"♦  the following textbook passages and illustrations reflect scenes highlighting public and private interaction with the opposite sex, in addition to a shared responsibility in performing domestic chores and parental cooperation in child rearing: ▸ men, women, and children engaged in farm labor74 ▸ kitchen scene: • young girl fills the sugar bowl • mother washes the spoons and plates  ▸ ▸ ▸ ▸  • father carries the serving tray of teapot and teacups75 mothers and fathers shopping with their children in the bazaars76 boys and girls walking together to and from school, sharing picture books, playing in the snow, and building a snowman (see below)77 narrative of a young girl simultaneously comforted by her father and mother78 passage about a father tenderly and lovingly dispensing advice to his daughter79  post-revolutionary elementary school textbooks."
2551,question,the overarching question is this: did the gender ideology conveyed in the “islamized” curriculum differ substantially from that found in pahlavi era textbooks?
2552,charge,how did islamic officials in charge of educational policies fail to notice that these textbooks contained images and text that clearly reflected western values?
2553,state,islamist officials also would have rewritten all the textbooks to accurately reflect the state’s preferred role for women.
2554,power,"in 1996 it was 78 percent, and by 2006 it had increased to well over 90 percent.90 (although this remarkable occurrence reflects the power of islam for traditional families, it is important to note that while during the late pahlavi period over half of iran’s population lived in the provinces, by 1996, over 60 percent had migrated to urban areas."
2555,term,"erikson is best known for coining the term “identity crisis,” and while he acknowledged that identity issues occur throughout an individual’s lifetime, dilemmas associated with its formation are more intense as children transition into adolescence.92 psychologists elaborate on this theory by confirming that during the pre-teenage and teenage years, males and females are especially cautious to ensure gender-role conformity."
2556,sexism,"this contentious debate was eventually resolved on the basis that separate schools for girls and boys ultimately required higher taxes and consequently should be viewed as an economically unviable and unfeasible option.99 in 1961, sociologist and author james coleman questioned the social climate of coeducational institutions in the united states, concluding that the prevailing youth culture, which interfered with academic performance and underscored popularity, proved especially damaging for girls, who became consumed with a self-imposed mission to render themselves “desirable objects for boys.”100 it took another two decades for additional studies to confirm coleman’s earlier findings and to draw attention to ongoing sexism in coeducational schools."

2559,institution,"in 2006 the gender gap in iran’s universities closed, reflecting a 50/50 ratio, and by the 2007/2008 academic year it had shifted in favor of women.120 the trend towards the “feminization” of higher education continues as women have begun to outnumber men at the post-graduate level by a ratio of 127/100.121 a 2006 bbc article poignantly captures the obvious surplus of women in higher education: twenty post-graduate students are sitting in a plush classroom listening to a lecture on environmental management at the islamic azad university—a private institution with 1.6 million students across iran."

2565,conviction,"when ayatollah khomeini referred to the war as “a blessing” and called on women to assist in the war effort, he underestimated how women’s participation would challenge the ideology of women’s role in a patriarchal society.125 initially paralyzed during the war by the absence of fathers and husbands, and burdened by their dual roles as providers and caregivers, women nevertheless responded with valor and conviction to the requirements of a daunting task."
2566,war,"women’s rights activist, azam taleghani, recalls the nature of cooperation among women at large during this challenging time: during the war we joined the sisters mobilization organization."

2568,war,"as the war continued, women had to return to their homes, but they still continued their voluntary work, and had to organize their time in a way that would allow them to do their housework and their voluntary work in order to keep their family members happy.126 iranian women were mobilized in both urban and rural areas to cook, provide medical assistance, and seek employment to support their families—much in the same manner as world war ii had compelled many women to do so."
2569,war,"women from traditional backgrounds, most of whom had not participated in mainstream society during the pahlavi era, were now inspired to do so due to the exigencies of war."

2571,war,author and researcher dr. elahe rostami-povey writes that the war reduced the supply of male labor and increased the number of women seeking work.
2572,state,"by not reporting these workers, employers avoided paying taxes to the state and benefits to the workers."
2573,war,this lack of recordkeeping also accounts for the fact that there are no statistics regarding how many women were employed during the war years.
2574,war,"(by contrast, figures pertaining to the american workforce during world war ii reveal that between 1940 and 1945, the percentage of women in the u.s. workforce increased from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent, and by 1945 nearly one out of every four married women worked outside the home."

2576,custody,"war widows, in particular, were outraged when shariabased laws assigned guardianship of minors and childcare payments from the martyrs foundation (bonyad-e shahid) to the child’s paternal grandfather.130 in 1985, as a result of vehement protests and petitions, the parliament approved a bill granting custody of children whose fathers had been killed in the war to their mothers.131 sporadic concessions such as this one signaled the state’s need to rely on women in a calamitous time."
2577,war,"author louise halper believes that as difficult as those years may have been, they were instrumental in “altering the consciousness of many women, particularly popular class132 women [who] not only felt empowered, but [also] obliged to discuss their status and establish  the continuity of their participation in public life.”133 and legal anthropologist ziba mirhosseini asserts that in light of women’s wartime efforts, “a door from within was opened that could no longer be closed.”134 in other words, having worked outside the home during the war, iranian women proved to themselves and others that they could play an important role in the survival of their families and in the society at large."

2580,war,"the gender-bias disposition of the ruling establishment continued, with khamenei’s numerous pronouncements, including: the real value of a woman is measured by how much she makes her family environment for her husband and children like a paradise .…and the fundamental job assigned to a woman is marriage and motherhood.2 while the war years had been marked by ideological stability, the presidency of akbar hashemi rafsanjani (1989–1997), following iran’s cease-fire with iraq, marked the emerging stages of a more tolerant atmosphere."
2581,state,"despite the fact that the majority of religious women seek reform within a non-western, indigenous, or koranic framework, and their secular sisters subscribe to a separation between “church and state” (and to the egalitarian principles enshrined in the 1979 convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women), iranian women disregarded their personal differences and gave precedence to eradicating an inferior existence.4 to provide a context in which to understand how iranian women from such disparate factions became united in their goal to expand their rights and opportunities, we will examine the shifting political tides after khomeini—from the reconstruction period of president akbar hashemi rafsanjani through the reformist era of president mohammad khatami."
2582,death,"a driving force of moderation following ayatollah khomeini’s death, aytatollah ali hosseini khamenei was appointed as iran’s supreme leader and ayatollah hashemi rafsanjani, an influential shiite cleric, was  elected as the fourth president of the islamic republic."

2586,state,"as a moderate facing serious challenges and a declining economy, he advocated a free market economy and favored privatization of state-owned industries.5 he chose to have a cabinet of predominantly “well-educated technocrats rather than revolutionary ideologues,” declaring that he wished for a “government of experts, not politicians … as is needed in the period of construction.”6 criticized for having a significant number of “western-educated” ministers, he responded by stating that “studying in american universities was not and is not a negative point.”7 furthermore, he declared: “iran cannot live in today’s world without the material capabilities and the advancement of science and technology,”8 an attitude that was in direct contrast to khomeini’s ideological disposition and cultural revolution."
2587,state,"president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani (1989-1997)  rafsanjani’s shift in gender principles became apparent with his removal of quotas for women in fields of higher education and the launching of a nationwide campaign to stabilize  the massive population growth.9 his government reversed the republic’s opposition to family planning, and the ministry of health authorized clinics throughout the country to promote and dispense contraceptives as part of its family planning services, resulting in a dramatic reduction in population growth from 3.2 percent in 1986 to 1.5 percent by 1996.10 according to the united nations population fund (unfpa), iran experienced one of the fastest-known reductions in fertility, with the most significant decreases occurring in rural areas.11 while minor criticism of the state was tolerated during rafsanjani’s tenure, demonstrations against the government in the early 1990s were severely repressed.12 and yet opposition to the official ideology mounted."
2588,state,"in the decade following the revolution, rising social tensions and criticism of the islamic regime stimulated a rudimentary alliance between disillusioned supporters of the revolution and marginalized secular and religious women.13 the interconnection between church and state that had been the dominant order for centuries—with only a brief interruption during the pahlavi regime—was being challenged once again."
2589,state,khatami’s reforms disparity between the progressive and conservative visions of an islamic state that surfaced during rasfanjani’s term continued to give rise to ideological conflict.
2590,authority,"the reform movement ushered in by khatami resulted in the modification of numerous patriarchal decrees, thereby diminishing repressive measures, including those pertaining to family law, education, and employment.14 not only were a number of reformist politicians and islamist women appointed to positions of authority, but the center for women’s participation (markaz-e mosharekat-e zanan) was created as an extension of the president’s office in order to raise awareness and improve women’s rights."
2591,imprisonment,"previously affiliated with rafsanjani’s construction party, dr. mohajerani’s official liberal stance of “tolerance and laxity” (tasahol va tasameh) was the basis for a directive that sustained a dynamic women’s press, already set in motion by khatami in his capacity as minister of culture and islamic guidance under rafsanjani.16 avant-garde filmmakers, including tahmineh milani (two women, 1999), rakhshan bani etemad (the may lady, 1997), and samira makhmalbaf (the apple, 1998), along with progressive female journalists at various women’s publications, reflected the growing artistic and social forces challenging iran’s suffocating patriarchal atmosphere.17 new organizations and publications employed a more tolerant rhetoric, asserting the need for a “radical re-thinking of law, policy, and constitution.” the formation of more than six hundred nongovernmental organizations (ngos) contributed to the integration of women from divergent backgrounds,18 and this ambitious undertaking elevated the consciousness of the female population, who began to participate in a variety of reformist groups engaging in gender debate and resolution.19 although these forms of expression began to penetrate iranian society, persistent interventions by the council of guardians and the supreme leader disrupted the progressive platform, which as early as 1998 was threatened with laws forbidding the use of non-sharia standards for advocating women’s rights.20 by april of 2000, such assaults, symbolic of the ongoing political schism, led to the closure of over thirty reformist publications and the arrest and imprisonment of numerous defiant journalists."
2592,power,"despite khatami’s popularity and his landslide victory, he was routinely handicapped by the power elite, whose members denounced his constituency as “diseased people.”25 for example, when khatami initiated the adoption of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (cedaw), which was approved by a parliamentary majority, it was overruled by the council of guardians on the grounds that it “conflicted with several principles of the constitution, including inheritance and divorce laws, the veil, and polygamy.”26 given the severity of such impediments, it is likely that khatami felt it necessary to proceed with caution, despite his campaign assurances, rather than take the risks inherent in making full-blown concessions to a “radical” agenda."
2593,law,"and historians acknowledge that by accepting the election of khatami, iran’s conservative leadership “miscalculated the potential for the reform movement to garner popular support.”27 author ali ansari estimates that “much to everyone’s astonishment, the appeal of the modest intellectual proved infectious,” while sociologist asef bayat confirms that “khatami’s discourse of civil society, democracy, transparency, and rule of law, which were quite absent in the 1980s, became the dominant concept.”28 for women in particular, khatami’s moderate yet enlightened perspective was indeed  inspiring."
2594,freedom,"the khatami administration’s “move to allow greater freedom of expression to the press changed the face of media in iran,” effectively throwing open the floodgates for a thriving women’s rights movement that to this day refuses to surrender, despite the barricades erected by powerful patriarchal forces.29  a unique brand of feminism the seeds of a women’s liberation crusade sown over a century ago in iran blossomed into a unique brand of feminism during a most unexpected era."
2595,term,"energized by a new spirit of tolerance within the country and by an eclectic variety of postrevolutionary women’s publications, women began to identify with a growing movement that defined itself under the banner of various labels, including “women’s rights advocacy,” “islamic feminism,” “secular feminism,” and “indigenous feminism.”30 in its broadest definition, feminism refers to the array of movements and ideologies “advocating women’s rights on the grounds of sexual equality,”31 and it has come to be regarded by many scholars as harmonious with an interpretation enabling “women to maintain their religious beliefs while promoting a more egalitarian islam.”32 today, “islamic feminism,” a term initiated by female expatriates, flourishes as the predominant paradigm within iran among both devout and secular women who seek equality within the bounds of religious scriptures.33 islamic feminism aims to dismantle the dominant gender precepts—that is, those passages in the koran that justify the denigration of iranian women and are then objectified in divine law.34 scholars have debated the compatibility of the essentially western ideology known as feminism with the formulation of an indigenous definition that is based only partially on that ideology."
2596,authority,"they applaud this new directive for “expanding legal, literary and gender consciousness,” thus authorizing a woman’s right to ijtihad (independent reasoning) with respect to religious interpretation.35 for women to actively pursue the authority to alter what has historically been regarded as divinely ordained in the koran is extremely significant, particularly for religious women."
2597,prisoners,"endorsement by prominent female writers of a revisionist approach to religious scripture not only aims to diminish clerical authority but “to recapture both the purity and vitality of islam that existed at its inception.”36 at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum are scholars haideh moghissi, hammed shahidian, and sharzad mojab, who assert that islamic feminism is essentially “a compromise with patriarchy.”37 this group believes that a “religion based on hierarchy” is insufficient, particularly in its neglect of broader social issues, including sexuality and personal autonomy.38 for example, shahidian maintains: if feminism is a movement to abolish patriarchy, to protect human beings from being prisoners of fixed identities, to contribute towards a society in which individuals can fashion their lives free from economic, political, social and cultural constraints, then islamic feminism proves considerably inadequate.39 nonetheless, other historians assessing “women’s responses to patriarchy” acknowledge that educated muslim women, along with their secular counterparts and enlightened intellectuals, have been a significant force in constructing many of the early arguments concerning islam, gender, and equality.40 the rise of this new discourse has been instrumental in emphasizing that there is “no inherent or logical link between patriarchy and islamic ideals.”41 over the last two decades, the many voices in the vanguard of iran’s islamic feminist movement have included the following women: ♦  zahra rahnavard: former chancellor of al zahra university; wife of former reformist prime minister and presidential candidate mir hossein mousavi: “getting rid of discrimination and demanding equal rights with men is the number one priority for women in tehran.”42  ♦  dr. jamileh kadivar: professor and founding member of the association of iranian female journalists: “the interpretation of islamic laws and regulations by the members of the council of guardians and some islamic jurists has in practice disqualified women from running for presidential elections."
2598,taken,"i argue that some male conservative institutions have taken on the role of the official interpreters of the constitution and the shariah; however, these interpretations are being contested by women and through the changing political environment in iran.”43  ♦  parvin ardalan: journalist and cofounder of the one million signatures campaign: “islamic laws are not fixed."
2599,freedom,"therefore, when i do not believe in that custom and i do not believe them to be logical or i do not value them to be beneficial to society, especially to girls and women, i do not see it necessary to follow them.”45  ♦  azam taleghani: former member of parliament; founder of the publication payam-e hajar (hajar’s message); daughter of ayatollah mahmoud taleghani: “people are united in wanting to keep an islamic republic, but if the islamic republic doesn’t evolve and does not give priority to the will of the people, what remains of [the republic] to be kept?”46  ♦  mehrangiz kar: attorney and human rights activist: “today both religious and nonreligious women are bent on regaining their individual identity and freedom."

2602,prisoner,"payam-e hajar (hajar’s message) the weekly payam-e hajar (1980–2000), named after the prophet abraham’s wife and launched by azam taleghani, became a success virtually overnight by adopting a moderate position—denouncing both the “westoxicated” woman and the traditional muslim woman of the official ideology.55 a political prisoner during the reign of mohammad reza pahlavi for her anti-regime activities, and a member of the first revolutionary parliament, taleghani was among the initial wave of disenchanted islamist women who began advocating equal rights by challenging the outdated scriptures.56 as the official journal of the islamic women’s institution (mo‘assesseh-ye eslami-ye zanan-e irani), for which taleghani served as director, payam-e hajar openly contested the premise of many patriarchal laws in iranian society."
2603,imprisonment,"in one of her editorials, taleghani argued that while the law recognizes a man’s right to “take up to four wives as long as he is able to treat them all equally, the very fact that the infallible prophet muhammad was in principle unable to perform this task would make it highly inconceivable for the ordinary man to do so either.”57 in 2000, payam-e hajar was officially shut down for unspecified reasons.58  farzaneh (wise) farzaneh (1993–2009), a prominent, independent academic journal of women’s studies published in both english and farsi by the center for women’s studies and research, served predominantly as a theological and theoretical campaigning medium among academics, scholars, and policymakers in iran and abroad.59 its licensee, massoumeh ebtekar, served in khatami’s administration, and its editor in chief, mahboubeh abbasgholizadeh, was a well-known women’s rights activist, whose numerous public demonstrations culminated in her arrest and imprisonment in 2010.60 farzaneh’s exceedingly unbiased viewpoint may best be exemplified in the philosophy of abbasgholizadeh: we know that secular women do not share our convictions, but this does not give us any problems, since we are all working to promote the status of women."
2604,justice,"geramizadegan focused exclusively on debating gender issues from a legal perspective in hoquq-e zanan—with an emphasis on violence against women.64 when asked by author ziba mir-hosseini why she avoided the term feminism in her editorials, geramizadegan replied: our problem with this term is that it is associated with radical and extreme expressions of feminism; that is, it has not been understood as women’s social movement for equal rights and justice."
2605,justice,"when we see inequality, we want to change it in line with our culture and tradition.65 mir-hosseini indicates that hoquq-e zanan argued for “attaining justice and women’s equality within the norms of the sharia, as well as iranian mores and culture.”66 jens-e dovom (the second sex) jens-e dovom (1998–2000) was launched by noushin ahmadi khorasani, who was among the first women to procure a publishing license."
2606,authorities,"forced by authorities to cease publication in 2001, khorasani launched a quarterly journal, fasl-e zanan (women’s season) in 2002.68 zan (woman) zan (1998–1999), the infamously controversial publication founded by faezeh hashemi, the rebellious daughter of iran’s former president, hashemi rafsanjani, was the republic’s first women’s daily newspaper."
2607,state,"increasingly frustrated by the condition of women in iran, faezeh hashemi, who served as a member of the fifth parliament (1996–2000), was a vocal critic of the state’s discriminatory practices."
2608,criminal,"her candid interviews, speeches, and editorials—a constant source of outrage for the conservative coalition—made her extremely popular among women and youth.69 hashemi routinely advocated that women should engage in athletics and stand as candidates for the assembly of experts (majlis-e khobregan).70 not one to shy away from confrontation, she was notorious for her brash statements, including that “if men are our problem, then we should get them to read these issues.”71  the paper’s demise in its first year stemmed from two specific features: an interview conducted with iran’s former empress, farah pahlavi, on the eve of the persian new year—a controversial act given that anyone from the monarchy was considered taboo; and a satirical cartoon aimed at the islamic retribution law (qesas), in which the husband of a couple held at gunpoint beckons the criminal to shoot his wife: “kill her—she is cheaper!”72 hashemi’s defiant nature has continuously been the subject of media coverage and ultimately not without consequence."
2609,sentenced,"in 2012, she was sentenced to six months in prison for “making propaganda against the ruling system” and prohibited from participating in all cultural, political, and media activities for a period of five years.73 throughout all of her trials and tribulations, hashemi has always maintained that “it is not islam which forbids women from attaining office, but the interpretation of its teachings by the clerics.”74 zanan (women) known for its modern perspective on gender issues related to religion, law, culture, and education, zanan (1992–2008) was launched in february 1992."
2610,state,"with regard to women’s magazines upholding the islamic republic’s patriarchal stance on gender issues, the following are major publications sanctioned by the state: payam-e zan (woman’s message) inaugurated in 1992, payam-e zan is the official journal of the qom theological seminary."
2611,authority,"under the editorship of cleric seyyed zia mortazavi, this entity held the “pronounced patriarchal biases of sharia legal rulings to be immutable.”76 over the years, payam-e zan has vociferously denounced the equality premise in scriptures and even gone so far as to buttress its refutations by publishing a series of one hundred interviews with well-known professional muslim women who adhere to the principles of sacred authority."
2612,taken,"ettela‘at-e banovan was taken over by the islamic republican party and renamed rahye zeynab (zeynab’s path) after prophet mohammad’s granddaughter, while zan-e ruz retained its original name and operated under dr. zahra rahnavard and the editorship of shahla sherkat.79 neda (proclamation) the conservative journal neda (proclamation) was dedicated to a traditional islamic agenda, supporting privileges for women solely within the boundaries of a repressed atmosphere."

2614,question,"given its limited circulation and general lack of appeal, the journal was mainly employed for governmental and institutional research purposes.80  from anti-feminist to islamic feminist given the fact that various islamic precepts impede female equality, some scholars question the validity of islamic feminism."
2615,term,"among the many spokeswomen articulating a new spirit of righteous advocacy were: ♦  mahboubeh abbasgholizadeh, who wrote many articles for zan-e ruz during the early 1980s rejecting the term “feminism,” shifted her stance during the 1990s."
2616,state,"as the editor of farzaneh, she argued that “women’s issues and feminism must be studied systematically” and she aimed to “put pressure on the islamic state by emphasizing that inequalities between men and women do not originate in the quran but rather in the interpretation by religious authorities of the divine laws.”81  ♦  zahra rahnavard, in a 1999 interview with zanan, expressed disappointment in the state’s treatment of women, using the term “the second sex,” the title of simone de beauvoir’s famous feminist manifesto.82  ♦  noushin ahmadi khorasani, founder and director of nashr-e towseh publishing house; founder of the feminist publication jens-e dovom (the second sex) for me the struggle for women’s rights is life itself."
2617,state,"while my fellow countrywomen suffer from discrimination and prejudice, my fight against such inequity is among the pillars of my life.83  ♦  faezeh hashemi who, during the early revolutionary years was adamant that the hijab was “an indisputable symbol for muslim women” presented a far different picture in 1997, when author jane howard was introduced to her at a state dinner given by khatami’s wife, zohreh sadeghi: she was tall, leggy, with blond hair."
2618,state,"in fact, by avoiding western terminology, these women were able to successfully renegotiate and even reverse some of the initial discriminatory laws and policies regarding employment and education, including permission for unmarried women to study abroad and to serve as “investigative” and “research” judges.85 and in 2010, when zahra rahnavard publicly denounced the state’s initiative to reintroduce a bill granting men the right to polygamy without the consent of their wives, she diplomatically employed the following rationale to demand that “experts and progressive-minded individuals” reassess the issue: calling off the bill from the parliament’s agenda is not a feminist demand, but rather a symbol of the national demand for the prosperity of the iranian nation and the stability of the iranian families.86 forged out of a common commitment to women’s rights, a united force has emerged between secular and religious women."

2620,where,"chapter six zanan magazine  it takes artfulness to address taboo issues.… doing journalism in countries like ours—where … the system thinks if you say anything it’s going to fall apart—it’s like being a trapeze artist 1 shahla sherkat, award-winning journalist, founder and editor in chief of the feminist magazine zanan (women) [zanan was shut down for] endangering the spiritual, mental and intellectual health of its readers, and threatening psychological security by deliberately offering a dark picture of the islamic republic.2 press supervisory board of iran, backed by the ministry of culture the men who try to stifle her or others similar to her should really keep in mind that these are demands and issues that their family members, their wives, their mothers, their sisters, and their daughters are dealing with, and just suppressing them is not going to make them go away.3 susan tahmasebi, women’s rights activist, regarding shahla sherkat’s relaunching of zanan-e emruz in 2014  as we discovered in the previous chapter, the post-revolutionary era in iran engendered an unexpected sisterhood of religious and secular women."
2621,law,"launched in february 1992 by shahla sherkat, zanan was independent and reformist—and instantly classified as “a sophisticated literary magazine with an overtly feminist agenda.”4 the exceptional contribution of this leading feminist publication has been applauded for its daring ventures, including a predilection toward a modernist interpretation of gender issues in the areas of religion, law, culture, and education.5 fiercely committed to women’s rights, deeply respectful of both religious and secular women, and unreservedly bold in its ideological objectives, zanan, from its inception, offered its readers incisive articles and editorials that did not equivocate in confronting the male-controlled clerical establishment."
2622,sharia,"under the astute leadership of its award-winning editor in chief, zanan was distinguished as a “major voice of reform,” “challenging the foundations of the dominant forms of shi‘ite jurisprudence” by demonstrating the multiple ambiguities in koranic verses.12 afsaneh najmabadi, professor of history and of studies of women, gender, and sexuality at harvard university, contended that, “at the center of zanan’s revisionist approach is a radical decentering of the clergy from the domain of interpretation … which challenges the foundational concept [of] deference to the rulership of the … velayat-e faqih [guardianship of the jurist].”13 zanan’s deliberate departure from the status quo has been widely applauded for inaugurating a “new chapter,” influencing “the evolution of ideas … and the progression toward a sharia-based feminist discourse.”14 in communicating with her readers, sherkat employed a diversified approach to her magazine, in which unorthodox opinions suggested the fluidity of women’s prerogatives in islam."
2623,state,"the publication’s front-page features, part of zanan’s enduring legacy, include the following articles on these important topics: ♦  domestic violence ▸ “sir, have you ever physically assaulted your wife?” ▸ “the beating of a woman is one of the areas of a man’s authority” ♦ gender discrimination ▸ “female students behind invisible fences” ▸ “why don’t women get paid as much as men?” ▸ “women’s issues do not have priority” ▸ “once again—limitations on young women entering universities” ♦ biases found in the islamic constitution ▸ “article 1133 of the constitution: a man can divorce his wife anytime he wants” ♦ patriarchal laws ▸ “man: partner or boss?”16 provocative features also focused on such taboo subjects as “the arrival of the new iud” and “this is forbidden love street,” which dealt with the state’s infringement on the natural sexual desires of adolescent boys and girls.17 zanan’s monthly “roundtable” discussions provided insightful discussions by men and women from various intellectual fields on relevant topics, including “what are the most important issues facing women?” their dialogue on such issues as “the necessity for women to develop themselves in all areas,” “the division of labor in the household” and “the state’s  exaggeration of the importance of motherhood”18 provided a multidimensional overview of prevailing inequalities."
2624,confinement,"appearing in the magazine as well were numerous translated features on parenting and childrearing practices in western nations, celebrating the virtues of the career-oriented wife and mother while chronicling the physical and emotional ramifications of confinement to the domestic sphere."
2625,guilt,"articles such as “working mothers and feelings of guilt,” “we should not be slaves to our children,” “do i have the right to enjoy my job?” and “mother, why do you work?” exposed the personal and professional benefits of working women and the “normal” feelings of separation anxiety associated with this lifestyle.19 the following excerpts from zanan articles dealing with the challenge of balancing family and work enumerate the merits of finding fulfillment outside of the household and the importance of communicating this message to one’s children: ♦ do you always feel that all your time is at the service of your children and that you neglect yourself most of the time?"
2626,guilty,"just because you are a mother does not mean that you have to sacrifice your entire life.… your child needs to slowly take other matters into consideration, to be respectful towards your feelings and your right to accomplish what you want.20 ♦ for every moment that i feel good about my career, i have moments where i feel guilty."
2627,state,"among the revered writers whose work was featured in zanan: british novelist mary wollstonecraft (1759–1797), whose a vindication of the rights of woman (1792) disclosed the manner in which “religion” and “the language of men” have devalued women and deprived them of their “natural prerogatives in life.” wollstonecraft addressed the “pernicious effects arising from unnatural distinctions established in societies,” and how “man” has manipulated the system in order to impose “an unconditional obedience,” reducing a woman to “a slave in every situation.” ♦ american novelist kate chopin (1851–1904), whose short story “the story of an hour,” published in 1894, covers one hour in the life of louise millard, who appears to be in a distressed state upon hearing the news of her husband’s sudden death."
2628,freedom,"the reader learns, however, that louise is in fact invigorated at the thought of regaining her freedom: “free, free, free!"
2629,death,the story of this despondent housewife held captive by social norms symbolizes that the only way for a woman to hold on to her newly-found freedom would be through death.
2630,infamous,"♦ british novelist virginia woolf (1882–1941), whose acclaimed 1929 essay, “a room of one’s own,” included her bold declaration: “lock up your libraries if you like, but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of the mind.” ♦ american feminist charlotte perkins gilman (1860– 1935), who wrote the home (1903), the man-made world: or, our androcentric culture (1911) and herland (1915) as a response to the male-centered ideology of divine scriptures, declaring that there is “no female mind, as the brain is not an organ of sex.” perkins advanced the notion that “a normal feminine influence in recasting religious assumptions will do more than any other thing to improve the world.” ♦  french feminist and author simone de beauvoir (1908– 1986), whose revolutionary treatise the second sex (1949) significantly contributed to feminist rhetoric by challenging a woman’s “assigned” role as “the second sex.” critical to her argument is her infamous adage, “one is not born, but rather becomes, woman” (on ne naît pas femme, on le devient)."
2631,slavery,"the author contends that women have the ability to destroy the fabricated social distinctions between the sexes: “when we abolish the slavery of half of humanity, together with the whole system of hypocrisy it implies, then the ‘division’ of humanity will reveal its genuine significance and the human couple will find its true form.” ♦ american writer judy syfers, whose essay “why i want a wife” appeared in the inaugural issue of ms. magazine in 1972.24 in her sarcastic monologue, syfers enumerates the enormous benefits of being a married man: “it suddenly occurred to me that i, too, would like to have a wife."
2632,injustice,"♦ african american author alice walker, whose in search of our mother’s garden (1983), a collection of thirty-six essays, presents a gripping portrayal of survival and women’s solidarity amidst unimaginable injustice—the degrading, inhumane treatment of the enslaved woman and the multiple burdens of racial and gender oppression."
2633,where,"beauty and fashion magazines are implicated for propagating an unrealistic feminine ideal during a vulnerable phase when young women may be conflicted by contradictory information concerning their role as women in society.27 however, the opposite can also be argued; that is, the messages conveyed by more serious women’s publications, such as zanan, may have the ability to diminish the impact of “unhealthy societal messages.”28 mary pipher, clinical psychologist and bestselling author of reviving ophelia, validates that exposure to strong female role models in cultures where women are expected to “sacrifice” and “relinquish” their “true selves” can profoundly alleviate many of the anxieties associated with a subordinate existence.29 developmental psychologist jean piaget’s theory of cognitive development attests to this as well."
2634,freedom,"he emphasizes the value of acquired knowledge in the development of “morally autonomous” individuals and the formation of their capacity to emerge as agents of social change in societies that devalue and degrade freedom.30 adolescent girls (and women) were introduced to the “voices, visions, and lived experiences” of women through articles in zanan that chronicled female oppression, and such content was potentially a potent means of consciousness-raising."
2635,freedom,"by presenting articles to a generation of women fascinated by western culture, yet for the most part deprived of access to it due to censorship, zanan has introduced its readers to a prohibited ideology of enhanced freedom and infinite possibilities."

2638,where,"one of the leading ideologues of the islamic republic, he was one of the original seven members of the council for cultural revolution assigned to islamize all universities in the aftermath of the revolution.34 soroush, born hossein dabbagh in 1945, was raised in a religious household and pursued higher education in both iran and england, where he studied the history and philosophy of science after earning degrees in pharmacology and analytical chemistry.35 in his monthly publication kiyan (1991), soroush began to revise and reinterpret islamic theology, based on his extensive knowledge of philosophers such as hegel and fromm, without sacrificing the essence and sanctity of divine principles.36 greatly admired by women and youth, soroush’s argument that “our comprehension of religion is scientifically, socially, and culturally constructed, and hence open to interpretation,” supports a rapprochement between islam and democracy, and accordingly facilitates the disclosure of feminist ideals in religious dogma.37 in a 2000 interview with zanan, soroush articulated his belief that “god manifests himself in each historical period according to the understanding of the people of the era,” and thus justified islam’s harmony with modern conceptions of scientific knowledge, human rights, and democracy.38 anthropologist and author ziba mir-hosseini confirms that “soroush’s approach to sacred texts has not only enabled women in zanan to frame their demands within an islamic framework, but also encouraged clerics for whom gender has become a ‘problem’ to address it from within a ‘fiq‘h’ framework.”39 like many of his progressive-minded counterparts, abdolkarim soroush eventually fell victim to the tide of conservative backlash."
2639,authority,"since 2000, he has continued his new age discourse as a visiting scholar and lecturer at harvard, princeton, and yale, where he remains an icon of enlightened religious theory.40 high-ranking shiite clerics mohsen kadivar and hujat ul-islam muhammad shabestari undertook paths similar to that of soroush and disputed the absolute authority of the clerical establishment."
2640,state,"in a 2008 interview in the german online publication for dialogue with the muslim world, qantara, shabestari stated that “islam is a religion in every sense, not a political agenda.… the first priority for the islamic world today is that it should become aware of the present state of humanity.”41 in 2004, mohsen kadivar, the brother of former parliament member jamileh kadivar and brother-in-law of politician ata‘ollah mohajerani, declared: every member of society and every member of government is subject to the law."
2641,sentenced,"after all, the supreme leader doesn’t come from god!42 in 1999, kadivar was tried and sentenced to eighteen months in prison for challenging the doctrine of clerical rule."
2642,where,"today, he resides in the united states, where he is a visiting professor in the department of religion at duke university.43  a clerical-secular collaboration the wisdom and insight of these thinkers validated zanan’s objectives, as did the collaboration between a young, mid-ranking cleric well-versed in juridical protocol and a secular attorney with legal expertise."
2643,law,"regular features by seyyed mohsen saidzadeh and attorney mehrangiz kar, “one a male religious scholar and one a female intellectual—side by side—pursued discussions regarding women’s related jurisprudence and law.”44  saidzadeh, possibly the most “radical … and vocal proponent of gender equality” and one of the earliest advocates of islam and feminism in post-revolutionary iran, was born and raised in the small town of qaen in the province of south khorasan.45 a graduate of the qom theological seminary (madrese-ye-ali-ye qazai’i-ye-qom), he resigned soon after earning his judgeship in 1983 to embark on a personal exploration of religious issues relating to women."
2644,penal,"saidzadeh began writing in may 1992, when his first series of articles appeared in zanan under the name of his wife, mina yadegar azadi, an unknown secondary school teacher.46 his editorials examining islamic law within the family, the capacity of women to serve as judges (mujtahid’n), and women in the penal system (qesas) “showed with certainty that there is no unanimity regarding women-related religious commands, and, secondly, that these directives must change on the basis of the requirements of the time.”47 in later years, when his authorship was uncovered, saidzadeh explained that the pretense was solely for the purpose of providing his wife with entry into the field of journalism."
2645,lawyer,"in the aftermath, saidzadeh continued to write, establishing the need for women’s roles to be “regulated by familial and social circumstances … as opposed to natural or divine will.”48 saidzadeh, like soroush, considered the traditional religious approach applied in modern-day society as “the lowest-ranking religious science” and maintained that a reformulation of the body of islamic laws within the “new political context” would enable women to engage in advancing their own needs.49 saidzadeh’s moderate clerical philosophy corresponded to the secular views of human rights activist and lawyer mehrangiz kar."
2646,law,"like all other female lawyers, she was not prevented from practicing law but could not hold certain positions and instead was confined to a more bureaucratic position."
2647,custody,"eventually, however, she managed to represent women in divorce, adultery, and child custody cases."
2648,lawyer,"adhering to the new islamic laws in order to protect herself from being banned from working as a lawyer, she reluctantly gave in to the dress codes and worked within the boundaries of the system, while at the same time citing modernist islamic thinkers in her defenses.50 drawn into collaborating with her islamic counterparts, kar joined the reformist movement in the early 1990s."
2649,state,"a new force emerging from within had begun to challenge the status quo.52 kar, who had never resorted to religious criteria in her writings, and whose work prior to 1979 focused primarily on social reform, agreed to work for zanan as she was convinced “that this was a historic occasion—one that she knew would benefit women and the women’s movement.”53  mehrangiz kar  in 1993, with kar’s permission, saidzadeh modified her written work as a precautionary measure aimed at preventing the magazine from “being charged with blasphemy.”54 her inaugural article titled “women’s position in iran’s penal law,” published in the summer of 1993, was a critique of the retribution law in a manner reflecting the necessity for “universal human rights to be the basis of all legislation.”55 kar’s articles, which appeared in zanan at regular intervals, revealed her knowledge of the judicial process, while saidzadeh’s “mastery of the sharia ensured that the debates remained within the acceptable boundaries of religious dogma.”56 in 1998, this unusual collaboration ended with the abrupt demise of saidzadeh’s career, after he published an article in the daily newspaper jame‘eh (society) comparing the discriminatory policies of the state to those of the taliban in afghanistan: based on these traditional texts, they should follow the same route as the taliban have, and some in iran have actually done so."
2650,court,"one example is the story of some fanatics in iran who have tried to prevent women from biking, which is in the same tradition as that of the taliban’s prevention of women from riding horses.57 as a consequence, saidzadeh was excommunicated, imprisoned, and forbidden to publish.58 nevertheless, saidzadeh continues to maintain the validity of feminism in iran as a viable “social movement,” which, through emphasizing the common humanity of the sexes, endeavors to free women “from an unwanted subordination imposed by [an] androcentric society.”59  discord between feminist allies mehrangiz kar remained with zanan until her arrest in april 2000, after she and sixteen other reformist women, including shahla sherkat, attended the berlin conference on “the future of reform in iran.”60 in the aftermath of this meeting, the groundbreaking reconciliation between secular and religious women was momentarily brought to a halt when kar was sentenced behind closed doors to four years’ imprisonment for her criticism of the islamic constitution, while sherkat was tried, fined, and released in an open court for questioning the religious dress code.61 kar was bitterly dismayed at sherkat for not coming to her defense and for choosing to protect her magazine over her relationship: we always sensed that there was a gap."
2651,imprisonment,"under pressure from the european union, khatami officials intervened, allowing her to leave for treatment in the u.s.63 over the years the rift between the two women has been attributed to kar’s secularism  versus sherkat’s religious identity, and there has been a range of speculation including sherkat’s alleged fear of “possible retaliation by the system, loss of employment and imprisonment.”64 although such conclusions are entirely plausible, the decisive issue for sherkat may have been neither one of those considerations."
2652,situation,all this puts us in an incredibly compromising situation.
2653,alleged,"i have also had to sell my house.66 despite the difficulties of keeping zanan afloat, it appears that the determining factor for sherkat was to forge ahead with an arduous undertaking and her altruistic mission, believing that “nothing is impossible.”67 therefore, the alleged act of betrayal of her colleague mehrangiz kar is in all likelihood attributable not to differences in personal ideology but to sherkat’s commitment to advancing the women’s movement in iran by making certain that zanan endured."
2654,state,"during a period in which reformist publications were regularly shut down for the slightest deviation from state ideology, it is a bit of a mystery how zanan managed to survive for almost two decades."
2655,power,"while sherkat’s passion, determination, and dedication are obvious, and her skill in presenting controversial topics is no small achievement, the magazine’s staying power is baffling given that its content is far more radical than that of other similar publications."
2656,sharia,"during her many trips to iran, sciolino, a correspondent for newsweek and the new york times, often contemplated this unusual fact: “sometimes i could not figure out why zanan had not been shut down.”70 in her extensive documentation of women in the muslim world, ida lichter considers the same question: “it is remarkable that zanan has survived for sixteen years in a country that reporters without borders has called the biggest prison for journalists in the middle east.”71 in april 1997, khatami acknowledged in an interview with sherkat that “the culture of patriarchy is one of the most important impediments to women in iran, and … the laws pertaining to gender equality will benefit civil society.”72 mir-hosseini observes that, although khatami’s pledge for freedom was not entirely fulfilled, “reformist efforts to reconcile islam, democracy and human rights brought to the surface many of the inherent contradictions between the constitution and gender rights in sharia law and democratic ideals.”73 in many ways, sherkat’s role as a “persistent trespasser” has been indisputable in this regard.74 while khatami was unable to prevent the closure of numerous reformist publications, he may have traveled the extra mile for zanan."
2657,charges,"this contention stems from the charges accusing sherkat of “breaking the law and defaming military and revolutionary institutions.”75 zanan’s demise resonated in iran and around the world, as activists and supporters petitioned the iranian government to reinstate the journal’s license.76 sherkat’s legal advisor stated that the manner in which the magazine was shut down may have violated official standard procedure: events that have taken place since the license revocation suggest that the decision was motivated more by personal and ideological animosity of a few individual members and not the whole press supervisory board which presumably ordered the license revocation.77 after the closure of zanan, sherkat—who was honored in 2004 with the courage in journalism award by the international women’s media foundation for her “dangerous and challenging work” and in 2005 with the louis m. lyons award for conscience and integrity in journalism from the neiman foundation for journalism at harvard university—accepted a management position in an arts and cultural institute."
2658,taken,it has been two years since they have taken from our family our 16-year-old daughter zanan.
2659,where,"in an interview with bbc correspondent jane howard, sherkat recalled attending elementary school in this dual atmosphere: he [her father] was very particular about the hijab and we even wore our headscarf to school and sometimes the chador too.… at the time i went to school, there would be  girls sitting next to me with miniskirts, but i was never made to feel uncomfortable.79 in later years, at her mother’s insistence, the family moved to tehran, where sherkat earned her undergraduate degree in psychology from tehran university."
2660,serving,"in 1982, she was approached by zahra rahnavard to “revitalize” zan-e ruz (today’s woman).80 mohammad khatami was serving at that time as supervisor for the keyhan institute, the publishing house that owned zan-e ruz."
2661,state,"the beds are made, the table is set.… it got to a point where i said no more.81 in 1991, sherkat departed from zan-e ruz amid a dispute over the publication of an essay by renowned filmmaker mohsen makhmalbaf, in which he harshly reacted to criticism of one of his movies by state officials."
2662,serving,"during this period, khatami, who was serving as minister of culture and islamic guidance, came to her defense by supporting makhmalbaf’s right to rejoinder."
2663,injustice,"its pages include hard-hitting, inspiring pieces, such as “why are men unaware of their violence and aggression toward women?” and “the injustice faced by female factory workers in iran.” articles often focus on the harrowing circumstances women face when handicapped by legal restraints, and the magazine also includes candid interviews with well-known women’s rights activists in iran, as well as coverage of international women’s issues."
2664,question,in the following chapter we will examine evidence of the islamic republic’s failed gender ideology and highlight the efforts iranian women are making in order to answer this ongoing and provocative question: can women in iran ever be equal?
2665,sentenced,"the previous disconnect between iranian women has transformed into a collective movement which will not be silenced.1 delaram ali, twenty-four-year-old sociology student arrested and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for her participation in the haft-e tir square protests in 2006 the only way the women’s movement, as a new social movement in iran, can move their rights forward is through a change in the laws … women citizens have the right to object to discriminatory legislation."
2666,repression,"the most recent presidential administrations have brought both increased repression (under former president mahmoud ahmadinejad, 2005–2013) and renewed hope (under current president hassan rouhani, 2013–present)."
2667,authorities,"the blacksmith’s son was adept in addressing poorer iranians— and had a better understanding of them than khatami did—but his fiery rhetoric and undiluted evocations of the 12th imam quickly alienated the us, europe and the arab sunni establishment.5 in 2010, ahmadinejad called on women to have larger families and to “perform their most important duty: raising the next generation!”6 to encourage this new directive, the iranian government implemented a policy whereby it would pay families a sum of $950 for every newborn, with an additional $95 annually until the child reached eighteen years of age.7 in addition, authorities became more aggressive in apprehending women for dress-code  violations, and, as referenced in the previous chapter, the government shut down zanan, the country’s leading feminist magazine."
2668,where,"nearly three million peaceful demonstrators turned out on the streets of tehran, voicing their slogan “where is my vote?” and the iranian green movement was born."
2669,authorities,"despite the nonviolent actions of the demonstrators, there were many instances in which authorities resorted to violence."
2670,death,"in 2009, the world watched in horror the video of twenty-sixyear-old neda agha soltan’s shooting death during demonstrations rejecting the outcome of the presidential election, which was repeatedly aired in the media.8  the 2009 green movement."
2671,power,"neda agha soltan (1983-2009)  iranian-american historian, author, and director of iranian studies at stanford university abbas milani asserted: the movement was widely seen as a new non-violent, non-utopian and populist paradigm of revolution that infused twenty-first-century internet technology with people street power."
2672,detainees,"turning a blind eye toward mistreatment and harsh sentencing of women protesters, ahmadinejad also ignored allegations of rape and torture of detainees.11 hassan rouhani, a critic of ahmadinejad, ran for president in 2013 using the campaign slogan “moderation and wisdom.” he called for increased engagement with the outside world and initiation of talks with the west."
2673,power,"although rouhani seems committed to women’s issues, and some reforms have been initiated during his tenure thus far, his views often starkly conflict with the policies and directives of the supreme leader, who holds the ultimate power."
2674,state,"he went on to state that “we will not accept the culture of sexual discrimination” and “women must enjoy equal opportunity, equal protection and equal social rights.” ayatollah khamenei could not find a single phrase in rouhani’s speech to agree with; rather, he proclaimed that gender equality is “one of the biggest mistakes of western thought.” against this political backdrop, this chapter will investigate the many ways in which twenty-first-century iranian women are fighting for equality with courage and resourcefulness —and how far they have come in their quest to gain their long overdue human rights."
2675,punishment,shirin ebadi spoke eloquently of the urgent need for change: is it right in the 21st century to use lashing as a form of punishment?
2676,justice,"they have used various means to express their opposition to discriminatory laws, and have used every opportunity to speak of equality and justice."
2677,taken,"the feminist movement has taken another step forward by demanding the elimination of all legal inequalities against women.12 the campaign gathered support across the country, expanding from tehran to tabriz, esfahan, hamedan, gorgan, zanjan, karaj, yazd, and kermanshah."
2678,law,"it successfully pressured parliament to amend the inheritance law in 2008, giving women the right to inherit their husband’s property."

2680,imprisonment,women do not have the right to walk on the beach.”19 baniyaghoub’s 2007 and 2009 coverage of gender-related protests in iran led to her imprisonment and thirty-year ban from journalistic activities.
2681,ward,"she believes “security forces have become more and more aggressive, even as women’s actions have become more peaceful over time.”20 nonetheless, baniyaghoub ended a letter to her husband, written from prison, on an optimistic note: we are 33 women with a variety of opinions and at times opposing points of views at evin’s women’s ward."
2682,prisoners,"some prisoners are supporters of the green movement, others are baha’i, born again christians or members of the mojahedin khalgh."
2683,where,"for young iranian women in particular, social media provides a venue where they can share their frustrations over discriminatory policies and their hopes for relevant change."
2684,authorities,"the following anonymous testimonials confirm the relevance of shared experiences provided by “the borderless nature of the internet”: ♦  “cyberspace has been a liberating territory—a place to resist a traditionally imposed identity.…” ♦ “the internet is a new sphere of possibilities … to build up a connection with physically removed persons.” ♦ “we are like scattered bits and pieces coming together.”22 it was not long, however, before the blogosphere drew the attention of the repressive  authorities."
2685,crime,"in 2006, the supreme council of the cultural revolution (sccr) issued the cyber crime bill, providing guidelines and penalties under the guise of “safeguarding individual rights as well as islamic, national, and cultural values.”23 while human rights defender, legal scholar, and feminist activist mehrangiz kar is discouraged by these policies and views them as another attempt to “stop the trend towards liberalization and to curtail the freedoms gained during the reform era,” journalist and women’s rights activist noushin ahmadi khorasani remains hopeful: “we are linked together indirectly through theoretical and practical work."
2686,authorities,"we work systematically; therefore, we operate like a chain.”24 extreme measures by the authorities to curtail the women’s rights movement have indeed been debilitating for activists, and yet the internet continues to be an alluring phenomenon for the nation’s youth."
2687,term,"the closure of thousands of websites has only intensified the determined resourcefulness of a youthful population, which has begun to resort to workarounds such as proxy servers, allowing the user to be redirected in disguise to the desired destination.25 a recent study conducted by the united states institute of peace estimates that there are 60,000 to 110,000 active blogs in iran today, reflecting not only the strong desire of young people to be part of the international community, but also that “as the most restive segment, iranian youth represent one of the long-term threats to the current form of theocratic rule.”26 today, 70 percent of iran’s population under the age of thirty adheres to a philosophical outlook that identifies with the ideals implanted during the reformist khatami era.27 their continued nonconformity with official values indicates that nominal concessions are no longer sufficient to hold their allegiance."
2688,cell,"the following statements in the 2008 documentary generation tehran indicate that “despite restrictions in every aspect of their lives, iranian youth exhibit progressive aspirations”: ♦  “our freedom should neither violate the rights of others, nor should it be confined to boundaries that limit us from improving ourselves.” ♦ “over here only your thoughts are allowed to be free.” ♦ “you will never be able to successfully define people by a piece of land.” interviews and footage from internet blogs and cell phone videos amplify the voices of dissent and disillusion in the 2010 documentary the green wave."
2689,building,"tavaana—meaning “empowered” and “capable” in persian—was launched on may 17, 2010, with a mission to support active citizenship and civic leadership in iran through a multi-platform civic education and civil society capacity building program."
2690,criminal,"tavaana holds a vision for a free and open iranian society, one in which each and every iranian enjoys equality, justice and the full spectrum of civil and political liberties.30 tavaana’s online courses, which are provided “on a secure, anonymous platform,” include an eight-session class taught by mehrangiz kar, entitled “protecting women’s rights in iran” that covers the constitution’s view toward women, a woman’s right to her body, freedom of movement, rights in marriage and divorce, protecting wives’ rights in marriage contracts, gender discrimination in criminal law, and women’s access to leadership and decision-making positions."
2691,detained,"leading human-rights advocates say there has been a clear increase in the number of activists arrested, detained and tortured because of their activity on social media, particularly on facebook, since rouhani took office in august 2013."
2692,arrested,"the detentions come as iran’s hardliners struggle to keep tabs on a growing population that wants greater freedom of speech, a right rouhani promised he would fight for when he was elected.31  paying a price for pursuing freedom the likelihood of being arrested and serving time in prison has not been a deterrent for many reformist women."
2693,imprisoned,many who have been imprisoned remain committed to the struggle within iran once they are freed; some leave the country in order to advocate for change from abroad.
2694,where,"in a country where freedom of expression is rarely afforded, women of all ages and from all walks of life relentlessly pursue equal rights, despite the fact that their earlier hopes have been shattered."
2695,sentenced,"their resolve remains strong even though some 4,000 students, women’s rights activists, and journalists continue to be detained in iranian prisons.32 among those paying a high price for speaking out in favor of women’s rights: ♦  ♦ ♦  ♦  ♦  ♦  in 2006, noushin ahmadi khorasani and parvin ardalan were part of a large contingent of peaceful protestors at haft-e tir square who were arrested, tried, and sentenced on various fraudulent charges.33 in 2007, parvin ardalan was awarded the olof palme prize for courage in stockholm, sweden, and although she was banned from leaving the country to accept the honor in person, the recognition itself was sufficient validation."
2696,sentenced,"in 2008, ardalan was arrested along with thirty-two other women’s rights activists, receiving a two-year suspended sentenced for organizing a peaceful protest at haft-e tir square in tehran."
2697,sentence,"she was charged with the intent of “endangering national security” and “propaganda against the state.” as with many of her predecessors, when ardalan eventually fell prey to the iranian authorities, it did not go unnoticed among western nations.34 in 2011, maryam majd, twenty-five, one of only a handful of iran’s female sports photographers, and filmmaker mahnaz mohammadi, thirty-seven, were arrested for “unspecified reasons.” mohammadi understood her detention in this way: “i am both a woman and a filmmaker—sufficient to be arrested.”35 controversial screenwriter tahmineh milani, fifty-one, who has endured numerous arrests for her fearless onscreen portrayals since her career began in 1989, is adamant “that a society which reduces women to mere sexual objects would have a high price to pay.”36 faezeh rafsanjani, journalist, founder of the magazine zan (woman), women’s rights activist, former member of iranian parliament, and daughter of former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, recently served a six-month prison sentence for her relentless criticism of the regime’s discriminatory practices."
2698,sentence,"therefore, when i do not believe in that custom and i do not believe them to be logical or i do not value them to be beneficial to society, especially to girls and women, i do not see it necessary to follow them.37  ♦  jila baniyaghoub, the award-winning freelance journalist mentioned earlier, served a one-year prison sentence and wrote about her experiences in her book, women of evin: ward 209."
2699,interrogation,"according to baniyaghoub, she was initially “blindfolded, and.… interrogated.”38 however, she is unshaken when recalling her interrogation session and the manner in which she boldly stood up for and defended her actions throughout the one-and-a-half hour process:  you call a peaceful protest radical?"
2700,national security,… does the fact that women are demanding legal equality endanger national security?
2701,freedom,"activist and journalist shahla lahiji estimates that despite the fact that female publishers and journalists continue to be handicapped by conservative restrictions,40 there are still more than 400 female publishers in iran today who are “younger and better educated than their predecessors.”41 the percentage of female journalists in iran has increased from 2.5 percent in 1971, to 10 percent in 1997, to 22 percent by 2006.42 in 2012, reports appeared signaling the reimposition of restrictions by thirty-six public universities across the country, banning female enrollment in seventy-seven academic fields, including mathematics, engineering, and accounting.43 kamran daneshjoo, the republic’s minister of science and technology since 2009, justifies this drastic policy as a measure for safeguarding adherence to “islamic values and principles” decreed in 1987 by the sccr (supreme council of the cultural revolution).44 the iranian parliament has accordingly voiced concern over the “destructive consequences of female matriculation on family life—such as employment and delays in marriage and motherhood.”45 the investigations of janet afary and pardis mahdavi on gender and sexuality among iran’s “dissident youth” testify that this reformist younger generation remains resolute in the face of adversity.46 their documentation of iran’s sexual revolution as a “source of freedom and an act of rebellion,” indicates a penchant for “living unrestrained sexual lives behind closed doors.”47 afary notes that, although these women have learned to accept the presence of religion as part of an everyday reality, the introduction to a liberal islam has significantly contributed to “closing the gaps that separate iran and western countries.”48 an eighty-two-page document on sexuality issued by iran’s parliamentary research department, highlighted in a 2014 article in the economist entitled “throwing off the covers,” confirms the fact that sexuality behind closed doors is clearly at odds with governmental directives."
2702,question,"if centuries-old religious tradition is the greatest obstacle to women’s liberation in iran, then the crucial question is this: can religion evolve?"
2703,freed,"is there a martin luther in iran, an individual who could modify the teachings of islam to the extent that women would be freed from repressive ideology?"
2704,alleged,"like many radical theologians, souoush insightfully challenges the ancient character of traditional dogma, referred to by his fellow activist and cleric, mohsen kadivar, as “the reign of political charlatanism in the name of islam.”56 while on one level the particular journey toward religious reformation is unique to iranian society, other historical events in which atrocities committed under the alleged guidance of the almighty have prompted reformers to alter the established conceptions of deity."
2705,death,"although the death of god was not implied in the literal sense, nietzsche’s philosophy fundamentally symbolized liberation from whatever fetters the mind and the spirit, much in the same manner that christian reformists were able to “find new destiny by destroying the old faith.”58 professor rex welshon explains that inherent in nietzsche’s “god is dead” philosophy is that religious human beings “killed” god through their hypocrisy and lack of morality: “god has lost whatever function he once had because of the actions taken by those who believe in him.”59 in fact, nietzsche’s proclamation of god’s “death” denotes a renewed sense of purpose: god is dead."
2706,death,what was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?60 nietzche’s philosophy was resurrected by leading theologians during the 1960s’ death of god movement.
2707,death,death of god theologians paul van buren and william hamilton “agreed that  the concept of divine transcendence had lost any meaningful place in modern thought.”61 they offered “the option of jesus as the model human who acted in love.
2708,freedom,"rather than exploiting the sanctity of the creator for the purpose of instilling a draconian ideology, iran might choose to follow a path set by iranian reformers toward a “responsible theology” and “a radical questioning of tradition, not [as a form of] negative rebellion, but [as part of that which] contains the seeds of affirmation of the esoteric tradition.”63 former president of iran mohammad khatami asserted that islam suffers from a “vacuum social theory,”64 and while he accepts that “a godless life is dark and narrow,” he also recognizes that “the limitations and relativity of all perspectives” is an important indication that “old interpretations do not suffice anymore.”65 mehrangiz kar is confident “that the new generation raised by cooperating religious and nonsectarian women will be able to dismiss the superstitions and patriarchal traditions … and not bend to the regime’s restrictions against individual freedom.”66 the emerging belief among iranian women that they have the right to determine how to live their lives is signaling the need for a new religious philosophy, one that prohibits patriarchy and oppression."
2709,taken,"this tells us the extent to which, in our understanding and practice of religion, we act unconsciously and involuntarily; this isn’t to be taken negatively but in the sense that we are guided by elements that aren’t in our control."
2710,freedom,"they do work, shape our lives, our mind, our language.67 as a reformist who believes in pursuing a renewal of islam, mohammad khatami provides us with a succinct yet profound message: if religion goes against freedom, it will lose.68 through their advocacy, commitment, and sacrifice, countless iranian women (and men) continue to demonstrate why religion must evolve—and dispense with its absolutist tendencies —if it is to exemplify moral validity."
2711,sharia,"in khomeini’s “islamic government,” a misogynistic regimen became embedded in a constitution reinforcing the primacy of the sharia (islamic law) over civil law and the absolute leadership of a shiite jurist over popular sovereignty."
2712,establishment,moghissi states that a popular theme in the aftermath of the revolution has been the  “observation that the islamic republic has not opened the gates … but that women are jumping over the fences.”69 what has become surprisingly apparent in post-revolutionary iran is that women have benefited from their education in ways that were not anticipated by the traditional establishment.
2713,war,while khomeini’s coming to power resulted in the overnight transformation of iranian society—including a profound loss of women’s rights—the consequences of the war with iraq (which enabled women to perform roles outside the home) and single-sex education (which enabled rural and religious girls to attend school and thrive) produced a shift in gender consciousness.
2714,freedom,young women who had previously been confined to their homes experienced a degree of freedom and self-determination that would prove life-changing for many.

2836,state,"a child of the revolution who has never left iran, pourhosseini courageously expresses the denigration of women in iran today and captures the foundational precepts of a patriarchal order enshrined since the ascension of the safavid dynasty (1501-1722) and the declaration of shi’ite islam as the official state religion."

2839,where,"but the sheikh on youtube had said one shouldn’t be timid about one’s islam, that even though wearing hijab was tough in so many places, “the more we are in number, the stronger our message.” had nour been born to an upper-middle-class family in la marsa, a suburb of the city where liberal tunisians lived amid western expatriates and restaurants that served prosciutto and gin, she might have rebelled by piercing her tongue."
2840,state,"but she was a daughter of le kram, a working-class neighborhood in a country where the state micro-policed people’s piety, and putting on the niqab was a natural act of defiance for a teenage girl."
2841,locked,"she had tried it on in the bathroom at home with the door locked, angling her body in different directions to see what it did to her eyes."
2842,power,"god isn’t some kind, benevolent power, he’s cruel.” the teacher crossed her arms over her chest, nostrils twitching."
2843,ordered,"someone had fetched the principal, who came running into the room and ordered the students into the schoolyard."
2844,court,a french colonial court sentenced her to death and she was tortured in prison.
2845,execution,"her trial became an international cause célèbre, prompting a moroccan princess, tens of british parliamentarians, and bertrand russell to plead her case to the president of france, who eventually stayed her execution."
2846,trial,"bouhired later married her french defense attorney, who had fallen in love with her during her trial, and became known as “the arab joan of arc.” she was featured in the battle of algiers, along with two other films, posed for picasso, and was sung about in persian."
2847,war,"those decades, leading up to and during the cold war, were dominated by postcolonial liberation movements that commanded sympathy in the west, and were supported, to varying degrees, by the soviet union and the united states itself."
2848,power,"in simone de beauvoir’s account of a 1967 trip to egypt, she was offended to find egyptian women bound to a “life of repetition,” subjugated by men who behaved toward them like “feudalists, colonialists, and racists.” a “deadly beauty” from the middle east who hijacked airplanes in service of her movement’s political struggle embodied an unexpected, raw female power."
2849,trial,"in the decades that followed bouhired’s capture and trial by the french and khaled’s hijacking, the political landscape of the middle east changed dramatically."
2850,war,the great secular nationalist liberation movements of the post–world war ii era that had challenged colonial control saw themselves weakened and subverted.
2851,war,"the palestinians, whose first intifada included many women among its leaders, saw many of their leading figures assassinated by israel; in iran, a cia-supported coup snuffed out a democratic push to nationalize the country’s oil industry; in egypt, defeat in the 1967 war against israel contributed to sclerosis within the nasserite movement, and eventually to the entrenchment of authoritarian military rule under hosni mubarak, a firm ally of the united states."
2852,justice,"across the middle east, secular movements and leaders fared poorly, whatever they were agitating for, whether the return of occupied land, political freedom, or socioeconomic justice."
2853,case,"but over time, it became starkly clear that that would not be the case."
2854,prisons,"prisons began to swell with islamists, activists and militants who, disenchanted with the old failed ideologies, turned to religion to inflect their opposition."
2855,torture,the torture they often faced accelerated and cemented their radicalism.
2856,power,"in 1979, with markedly little violence, the iranian revolution did something unthinkable: it dislodged a modern, worldly u.s.-allied government, and propelled to power a shia cleric, a gloomy medieval figure in black robes who promised his people independence and freedom under the banner of an islamic republic."
2857,where,"where all secular leaders, from cosmopolitan leftists to nationalist democrats, had failed, a cleric had succeeded."
2858,power,"and he was propelled to power by crowds filled with women; bare-headed women in skirts, conservative women in headscarves, united in their nationalist belief that iran must be independent of the united states."
2859,war,"in the 1980s, in the midst of the cold war, the united states backed muslim foreign fighters opposing the soviets in afghanistan."
2860,criminal,"iraqi women were ensnared in both the u.s.-run torture chambers of abu ghraib and the brutality of iraq’s criminal justice system; their defiled honor became a rallying cry for al-qaeda’s affiliate in iraq (a predecessor to the islamic state in iraq), and young women themselves began signing up for suicide missions in the sunni insurgency."
2861,freedom,"women galvanized the arab spring, often standing at the forefront of protests in cairo’s tahrir square, in bahrain and yemen, libya and tunisia, encouraging and egging on men to confront security forces, demanding political freedom, dignity, and opportunity."
2862,authoritarianism,"the west was deeply ambivalent about this sudden wave of change, despite the fact that the united states and europe had complained for years that authoritarianism was holding back the arab world’s development, allowing women’s inequality to fester and fueling radicalism."
2863,power,"as egypt’s revolution stumbled to find its feet under the leadership of islamists—politicians who had been democratically voted into power—president barack obama’s loyalty shifted toward the country’s generals, who were itching to consolidate their control."
2864,suppression,"in the course of about two years, these hopeful arab revolutions collapsed one by one, descending into civil wars or  suppression by the generals and autocrats who saw that the united states was distracted by other priorities."
2865,state,"out of this historic interlude of hope and chaos, into the resulting vacuum of instability, the islamic state emerged."
2866,state,"the islamic state rose from the recent histories of syria and iraq, the specific grievances and fractures of those countries."
2867,state,"but from the earliest days, the state told a different, loftier story about itself."
2868,where,"it promised the creation of an islamic homeland, an empirestate where muslims could live freely and justly under a kingdom of heaven."
2869,freedom,"if in 2011 the aspirations of young women across the arab world had been for freedom, a dream that seemed achingly close before disappearing into the smoke and tear gas of coups and massacres, by 2013, when is leader abu bakr al-baghdadi declared his caliphate, the future held only more of what simone de beauvoir had sniffed at previous generations of middle eastern women for accepting: lives of repetition."
2870,gang,"these supposedly better-for-women dictators were not opposed to imprisoning women or using sexual violence—gang rapes, virginity checks—to punish women who opposed them."
2871,state,"it was in this febrile, despairing atmosphere that the islamic state began unfurling its vision."
2872,state,it was neither authoritarian client state nor pretender to liberal democracy.
2873,state,"it was not a conventional nation-state at all, not obliged to follow the dictates of neoliberal capitalism."
2874,building,they set up makeshift clinics and schools for the islamic homeland they believed themselves to be building.
2875,freedom,"many of these women were trying, in a twisted way, to achieve dignity and freedom through an embrace of a politics that ended up violating both."
2876,justice,"they embraced an apocalyptic ideology, supported attacks on cafés and places of worship, and seemed to espouse their own subordination, through an ethos of separateness so severe as to forsake any real prospect of justice within its confines."
2877,state,"but the islamic state’s female would-be citizens harbored real expectations, and watched them quickly fall apart."
2878,power,"the militants showed themselves to be no better than the tyrants they claimed to oppose; they too used religion as ornament, were obsessed with power, spoils, and territory, ignorant or dismissive of even basic tenets of islamic justice."
2879,execution,they risked execution by rejecting the islamic state’s rule and trying to escape.
2880,death,"if they did escape, they risked death and social stigma afterward if they admitted to having willingly associated with or having believed in the caliphate."
2881,lawless,"many women found themselves trapped in a lawless place, strafed nightly by the warplanes of different nations."
2882,war,"though vanquished today as a battlefield force in syria and iraq, the islamic state is still with us: its supporters killed more than 250 people in coordinated bombings on easter sunday 2019 in sri lanka, and  its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi emerged in a video clip that same april, declaring that his group’s vision remained alive and vowing to continue its bloody guerrilla war against non-muslim unbelievers across the world."
2883,state,"this book follows thirteen women—some very young, some older; some educated, some not—as they sought lives in, or in support of, the islamic state."
2884,state,"the female victims of the islamic state, specifically the enslaved yazidi women, have commanded a great deal of attention."
2885,detention,"as i write this, there are thousands of is women and children lingering in camps and detention centers across the middle east—awaiting death sentences, suspended in stateless limbo, or resigned to permanent incarceration."
2886,term,their abandonment may be politically expedient in the short term.
2887,state,"not every woman who joined the islamic state wished to hurt, enslave, or oppress others."
2888,police,"if i speak wildly in my poems i speak against the police and if i manage to create a poem it’s against the police i haven’t written a single word, a verse, a stanza that isn’t against the police all my prose is against the police —miguel james [president ben ali] has done a tremendous job in tunisia and is well respected back home, as well as here in the arab world."
2889,state,"— in the period that stretched from its independence from france in 1956 to the 2011 revolution,  tunisia was said to be a secular country, but the state’s approach to religion was not so much secular as simply authoritarian."
2890,state,"the state controlled how tunisians practiced islam, down to the daily, physical details of their worship—dictating what women could wear, when men could go to the mosque—and it did so with the totalizing scrutiny of a police state."
2891,state,"president habib bourguiba, who ruled tunisia after independence, was enamored with the french model of laïcité—secularism in public affairs, aimed at bringing about a secular society—and, when he took office, brought islamic learning and instruction under the full control of the state."
2892,power,"when bourguiba took power, he shut it down."
2893,building,"like many of the middle east’s twentieth-century nation-building modernizers, he believed that society needed growth and discipline to modernize and catch up with the west, and that islam inhibited those qualities."
2894,power,"zine el-abidine ben ali, who seized power from bourguiba in 1987, further instrumentalized religion to establish his authority."
2895,state,"he allowed radios to start broadcasting the call to prayer, went on the hajj pilgrimage to mecca, and promoted folksy sufi festivals, pushing a curated, “moderate” tunisian islam that, as an ethos, made full submission to the state a core principle."
2896,imprisoned,"in 1989, he allowed candidates of ennahda, the religious opposition movement, to participate in elections, but when they fared well, ben ali tortured and imprisoned them."
2897,locked,"mosques were locked up outside prayer times, and police crept through the streets at first light, making note of who had risen for the dawn prayer."
2898,state,"despite all this, the state did not manage to turn tunisians into either state-friendly sufis or secular proto-parisiens; the majority remained conservative, traditional muslims."
2899,state,"under the chokehold of repression, asserting control of one’s religiosity became a means of challenging the state."
2900,state,"for many, being religious became a language through which to demand freedom from the state’s intrusion into daily life."
2901,conviction,"but the incident had doubled nour’s conviction to wear the niqab, and now, instead of changing surreptitiously by the bakery after she left the house, she put it on openly at home, wore it through the streets, and only took it off outside the school."
2902,police,"her mother, it seemed to nour, had no thoughtthrough position on why she didn’t cover her hair, apart from it saving her humiliation on the street and visits to the police station."
2903,custody,"along with this, he granted women sweeping rights in voting, marriage, and child custody that rapidly made tunisian women the most literate, educated, and independent in the arab world."
2904,imprisoned,"these families were nervous wrecks, in and out of police stations, living at the brink of poverty, with fathers, husbands, and sons who were imprisoned or in exile for dissident activity."
2905,police,"nour’s mother recounted these ghoulish stories often, hoping her daughter’s ears would catch some basic truths: the story about the woman who married an islamist and arrived at the wedding reception to find it swarming with police ripping the headscarves off guests; the stories about nighttime home raids of those suspected of “religious” activity."
2906,where,"the neighborhood mosque had a prayer room where girls could meet to talk and discuss religion, and it was here that the imam’s wife befriended her."
2907,guard,the prophet said: “guard yourself from the hellfire even with half a date in charity.
2908,where,"they started with coffee in the morning at negative café, where hisham had been trying to take her for weeks, after she’d complained raqqa had no modern coffee shops."
2909,power,"she read in english as much as she could, and began using english for certain terms that seemed to demand it: relaxation, money, power."
2910,law,her father-in-law prepared the shawarma meat—this was the task of a man—but it fell upon lina to help her mother-in-law cook the rest of the fare.
2911,law,her mother-in-law expected her to help with the cleaning and housework at her apartment.
2912,where,"in beirut, where the in-laws had lived previously, household help was readily affordable."
2913,toilet,much of middle-class beirut was composed of women whose manicured hands hadn’t touched a toilet brush in decades.
2914,law,"her mother-in-law’s withering, sing-songy voice, “shou, lina?"
2915,where,where were you today?” lina knew she was a faint-mannered woman; her milky-blue eyes and barely audible voice meant that people were perpetually asking her to speak up.
2916,building,"most nights lina fell asleep crying, listening to the lives of other people in the building."
2917,where,"and lina saw no other prospect of leaving that house, where the air was heavy with her stepmother’s displeasure and her father’s resigned sighs."
2918,locked,"he reacted so violently—calling her an animal, a disgrace—that she locked herself in the bedroom afterward and waited months before broaching it again."
2919,law,"she discussed her unhappiness with her family and in-laws, who were inconveniently tangled together; her husband was her first cousin, which made her mother-in-law also her aunt."
2920,abuse,"no one was willing to acknowledge the abuse she faced, and they all dismissed her idea."
2921,law,"you have kids, you can’t get divorced,” her mother-in-law said with finality."
2922,law,"according to the principles of islamic law, her husband was committing zina, adultery, the most grave of sins."
2923,abuse,she attributed her husband’s fecklessness and abuse to his lack of faith.
2924,where,where would she take them?
2925,building,"spring 2010, beirut, lebanon in the years since she had left the city, her father and stepmother had moved into an upscale building near the martyrs’ cemetery off tariq al-jadideh, a predominantly sunni neighborhood named for the long overpass road that led to the airport."
2926,war,"the downtown that she remembered as gutted by the civil war of the 1980s—its graceful, arched buildings had been empty shells, streets strewn with bombed-out rubble, empty lots like gaping teeth—was now a knife-edged, glittery re-creation of its former self."
2927,power,"despite the infusions of glamour and wealth, beirut was still one of those cities where the streets permanently bore the flags and billboards of an unresolved political story: the same old images of warlords from rival religious clans, militias, or power dynasties vying for control of the statelet, each beholden to some greater regional power with its own agenda."
2928,building,the apartment building was imposing.
2929,inside,it was his wife’s voice from inside that recalled them both.
2930,where,"the scene repeated itself in the kitchen, where her stepmother was making coffee."
2931,wall,"photos of the couple on holiday lined the wall, one of them featuring her stepmother in a bikini."
2932,law,"i’m okay with it, even if the others aren’t.” he was referring, she assumed, to his sister, her mother-in-law, who forbade divorce."
2933,charged,"lina had wished to stay here a while, to walk along the promenade near the sea, among the old houses with their arched, jewel-toned windows standing in charged conversation with the aggressive luxury high-rises."
2934,where,"she could sit in cafés frequented by pious men and women, where people drank spiced coffee and strawberry juice and enjoyed the frantic glimmering of the sun on the mediterranean."
2935,state,"but it was true, and pertinent information as she sought the state’s aid in finding a place to live."
2936,where,"it had a living room and a kitchenette, where lina could make tea and light meals for herself."
2937,court,"she feared that even here in germany, had she tried to divorce him in court, she might not be protected."
2938,case,"the case caused great public uproar, especially among german muslims, who felt the judge had inexplicably sided with a rebarbative, fringe reading of their faith."
2939,death,"for the muslim who takes her own life, hellfire is a ceaseless reexperiencing of the means of her death; lina had been spared this."
2940,building,"theirs was not a household filled with the finer elements of german child-rearing that other residents of frankfurt enjoyed: wooden building blocks, vintage editions of grimm’s fairy tales, and cartoons featuring intellectual farm animals."
2941,stretch,"their cramped, shabby flats didn’t get enough sunlight, permanently smelling of damp from drying clothes; their paychecks didn’t stretch easily to cover all the things a family needed."
2942,poverty,"for the turkish immigrant kids of frankfurt, being raised by a whole klatch blunted the effects of poverty, keeping it from bleeding into neglect."
2943,state,"the german state believed it could determine which children had the aptitude to enter the academic education system and which were best served (or alternatively, which best served the state) by entering a vocational stream that would end in apprenticeship and a life of, ideally, skilled labor."
2944,power,"the hauptschule track held no promise of securing for emma the one material possession she had come to covet in life—a bmw 6 series, with its sleek lines and glint of power—but spending time in the homes of her turkish friends showed her that family, with lots of children, was a wealth of its own."
2945,case,she liked the way each family kept folded-up mattresses and bedding in the corner in case of impromptu sleepovers.
2946,where,"one weekend afternoon in early autumn in the late 2000s, emma and her girlfriends were walking through one of the central squares in frankfurt, where turkish kurds who supported the kurdish separatist pkk movement back home in turkey liked to gather."
2947,inside,she felt cared for; she felt the loneliness inside her slowly being chipped away.
2948,freedom,wearing the hijab has given me freedom from constant attention to my physical self.
2949,where,"as in most cities and towns where turks had settled, in frankfurt, native germans’ discomfort with foreigners played itself out in petty squabbles over the aesthetics of shared public space."
2950,building,a pensioner in emma’s building who resented the strange smell of her downstairs turkish neighbors’ cooking would berate the family for failing to keep their window-ledge plants in bloom.
2951,state,"like many who were young when the german state began accelerating its guest worker program in the 1960s, the pensioner had internalized the government’s early position that the foreigners were there to fill a void in the labor market and then would eventually go home."
2952,war,"as germany struggled to rebuild itself and reenter european trade networks in the aftermath of world war ii, the foreign guest workers filled the jobs native germans didn’t especially want: construction, mining, metal industries."
2953,law,"initially, german law handled this imported labor as a pure human transaction and regulated the workers’ transience: they had to leave after two years of labor and were barred from bringing their families."
2954,state,"social prejudice and intense occupational discrimination was growing, though it was rarely discussed or acknowledged by the state."
2955,term,"the derogatory term for nonwhite, nonnative, non-western germans was ausländer, and it was gaining ground."
2956,state,"it was housing for vulnerable young people, supported by the state."
2957,state,"his desperate, simple act of protest resonated with those in tunisia who had also endured the state’s needless molestation at the most intimate level."
2958,power,le kram was the lone working-class quarter situated near this seat of power.
2959,police,"but closer in, among the fraying buildings, the signs of kram’s restiveness are evident: heaps of garbage the municipality fails to collect, graffiti that revolves around the despair of young men with too little to do, convulsed by anti-police rage and soccer mania."
2960,police,"the lady next door was in her housedress, telling everyone that local protesters had torched the police station and were now heading toward the headquarters of president ben ali’s political party."
2961,police,the police station in kram was the largest in all of greater tunis.
2962,freedom,"another staggered about, pumping a two-finger v in the air, slurring the two demands of the revolution, “hurriya” and “karama,” freedom and dignity."
2963,police,"together, they watched the police headquarters burn, their affiliations subsumed in the battle between the neighborhood and the police, who felt more than ever like an occupation force."
2964,police,the police abandoned their charred station and vacated the area.
2965,inside,"there were so many women that it was mayhem trying to get inside, into the small women’s prayer room."
2966,establishment,"after ramadan that year, the mosque built a separate women’s entrance, the first since its establishment many years before."
2967,term,"the term salafi refers to followers of a strain of puritan, revivalist islam that originated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in the lands that eventually became saudi arabia."
2968,term,"for this, they called themselves after the salaf, the term for the pious early followers of the prophet."
2969,state,"salafism grew and evolved over time in saudi arabia, fusing with the young state’s emerging national ideology and becoming crucial to the ruling al-saud family’s claim to legitimacy."
2970,building,"because salafism coexisted with, indeed underpinned, saudi arabia’s transnational activities during the 1970s and beyond—through its support for the jihad in afghanistan against the soviets; through its soft-power investments in exporting ideas across the muslim world via books, imam training, the building of mosques and religious centers—it eventually grew into a complex global movement with many different manifestations."
2971,where,"sometimes it existed quietly in european cities where it made people more pious and apart, but still peaceful; sometimes it took root in restive ghettos and banlieues, offering a language of division and militancy to muslim youth who already felt aggrieved, alienated, and isolated by european society."
2972,war,"those jihadists were also very much favored sons of the saudi state, but they turned against the saudi ruling family after the first gulf war of 1991, when american military bases cropped up across the saudi kingdom."
2973,war,"the broader war on terror was like truth kindling to the alqaeda remnants who claimed the united states was at war with islam: a years-long campaign operating across large swaths of the world, involving torture, black sites, and many civilian deaths, in the name of fighting terrorism."
2974,war,"the aimless insurgent veterans of the afghan war had been searching for the next front, the ideal just war."
2975,sharia,"while this group believed, as a matter of core principle, that muslims should be ruled by sharia law, they did not advocate imposing this through violent means, nor were they necessarily jihadists."
2976,state,"jamal, despite being fond of charles bukowski, believed tunisian society had an “over-masculinity” problem that applied to everyone, not just salafis, an amplified machismo that resulted from being kept permanently under the state’s boot."
2977,thug,"childhood angst, urban thug life, acute marginalization, and political and class grievances all fused together in a new salafi identity."
2978,police,"at first, these brigades protected residents from looting and vandalism after the collapse of the police force."
2979,where,"later, they grew into hubs of political activity, where organizers strategized on the local level, to ensure that old regime figures—from mafia bosses to local officials—did not creep back into political influence post-revolution."
2980,state,"everyone wanted to work on employment, dignity, and to make the youth feel like they had some stake in the state.” nour was ready for this, to start expanding her horizons, to find a place for herself in this new tunisia."
2981,wall,"their house was small and spare: a living room with a foam sofa, a chipped lacquer coffee table, and a plate embossed with allah  in calligraphy hanging on the wall."
2982,where,"she and karim sat with her parents in the living room, drinking tea as they all searched for things to talk about: he told them about his parents back in ben gardane, a town near the libyan border, and the challenges of living in france, where he had worked for some years as a waiter, trying to save up enough money to do something better than that."
2983,where,"this, in paris, left him with poor options: greasy shawarma joints or a possible new career in what he called “commerce.” nour didn’t know exactly what “commerce” meant, but by day six (karim was now coming to the house every day), she accepted it as honorable and correct that karim had left france—a country that had never wanted the best for tunisia or its citizens anyway—and returned home, where he could start over."
2984,wall,"something that would enable him to have two children and feed and educate them well, so that someday their children could live on the other side of the wall of inequality that he, nour, and everyone they knew had been scrambling against from childhood."
2985,state,"in tunisia, a state sector job was a golden ticket: a steady salary for life, a measure of social status."
2986,war,"the revolution spread to other parts of the arab world—first to egypt, then later to libya, yemen, syria, and bahrain—but in all of these countries, upheaval only led to more intense repression, civil war, or outright collapse."
2987,torture,"the party’s leader, rachid ghannouchi, back from decades of exile in london, promised that “tunisia was for everyone.” ennahda members who had suffered torture under the previous regime now served in the government alongside politicians from the old regime who had overseen those abuses."
2988,state,"in the past, even charity work was dangerous; the state viewed it as gateway behavior that led to ennahda or islamist sympathies."
2989,imprisoned,"he’s a good guy!” in kram, the women’s group that nour attended affixed themselves to ansar al-sharia, the postrevolution salafi group launched by abu iyadh, the most senior religious militant who had been imprisoned by the ben ali government and released after the revolution."
2990,sharia,"ansar al-sharia grew by about 1,000 percent between april 2011, the year it held its first annual conference, and april 2012, when the same event drew almost ten thousand young tunisians."
2991,sharia,"it was early days in the political market of the new tunisia, and everyone, from ennahda to ansar al-sharia, wanted to draw on the widest possible constituency."
2992,sharia,"ansar al-sharia operated skillfully in the new climate, with a robust facebook presence; in a two-month span, the group held sixty-five events in about thirty locations across the country."
2993,sharia,"a young tunisian graduate student who wrote his thesis on ansar al-sharia described it as “charity work on an industrial scale.” the founder of the group said, “we want to reach the hearts of people, not hurt them,” although he did little to intervene when salafis went too far and harassed people for drinking alcohol or dressing immodestly."
2994,sharia,"while, for women, the secular space within liberal tunisian society was emancipated but archetypically western and objectified, ansar al-sharia encouraged women to study, work, and function in society, albeit on the other side of a cloak of separateness."
2995,sharia,"women conducted their own dawah circles, where they invited new members to study and understand islam, and were active in running ansar al-sharia’s social media accounts."
2996,sharia,"the more cautious young salafis tried to fuse ansar al-sharia’s magnetic, antiestablishment energy to a more considered approach that emphasized working practically within the system."
2997,authoritarianism,"he could parse its theoretical and political evolution from the earliest writings of sayyid qutb, the egyptian militant-ideologue who advocated radical resistance to the nationalist authoritarianism of nasser, through to abdullah azzam, the palestinian jihadist theologian and co-founder of al-qaeda, who insisted that defensive jihad placed strict safeguards around civilian casualties."
2998,justice,"walid had listened to their arguments as a teenager on cassette tapes and videos, impressed by their plans to bring justice to society."
2999,war,"fighting the americans in iraq, to walid, was clearly just, an anti-imperial war."
3000,justice,"after years of secular indoctrination, it would take time and patience to persuade tunisians to give the islamist vision a fair hearing, to see it as a possible way of ensuring independence, social justice, and the core demands of the revolution."
3001,sharia,"she read a post from two local doctors, both women, who said they were working longer hours so they could donate a third of their salary each month to the ansar al-sharia movement."
3002,police,"when he explained this to his ex-wife, she shrieked that she couldn’t spin money out of air, either, and threatened to report him to the police as an extremist if he didn’t sort things out."
3003,police,"eventually he told nour it was the police calling, asking to see him, asking him about men he knew from france."
3004,police,"karim told nour that back in france, the police had also been monitoring him."
3005,police,nour’s mother finally asked her why the police were bothering him.
3006,power,"for the alawites, who were primarily peasants living in rural areas, the new arrangements offered a quick, unexpected path to power."
3007,power,"hafez al-assad, the father of bashar, took power following a coup in 1970."
3008,term,"he offered protection and patronage to shia clerics who were willing to anoint them as such; the prominent lebanese shia cleric musa al-sadr offered the gelatinous term “partners in distress,” hinting that alawites and shi‘ites shared contemporary political concerns, if not theological roots."
3009,power,"the chokehold of repression remained a constant in syria during the decades that followed, as power passed from hafez to his son bashar."
3010,arrested,"“it’s your turn, doctor,” they wrote playfully, addressing bashar alassad, an ophthalmologist by training, riffing the rhyme in arabic, “ejak el door, ya doctor.” but when they were arrested by police, their mocking graffiti turned into something like prophecy."
3011,tortured,"by late march, word got out that the youth were tortured in prison."
3012,police,"the police shot indiscriminately into the crowd, killing several people."
3013,killing,"the regime’s military laid siege to dara’a and began killing protesters who poured into the streets, sometimes more than a hundred a week."
3014,where,the dead cat had been lying on the side of the road near the bakery where her mother worked an afternoon shift.
3015,where,the old quarter had an antique medina where the tourists sometimes wandered.
3016,where,"but apart from the luxury hotels splayed along the beach, enclaves where nearly naked brits and germans lay on deck chairs amid palm trees, much of the city was squat and strewn with rubbish, lined with fast-food joints with cheap metal doors and closed storefronts."
3017,poverty,"at school, other children looked down on them for their poverty and fatherlessness and for their secondhand clothes."
3018,where,the roof contained little but the makeshift corrugated-tin shack where rahma did her dissections.
3019,poverty,"on other occasions, she had gotten herself into trouble for sticking up for weaker girls who were bullied for their looks, their poverty, their families."
3020,freedom,"life hadn’t allotted her the freedom to develop hobbies or pastimes, and she spent most of her waking hours working in a tin-roofed bakery and then waiting tables in a restaurant."
3021,taken,"as her children had grown older, olfa had started leaving them on their own; she had taken to locking the children in for the night when she left for her restaurant shift."
3022,where,the woman led her to a corner inside the tent where women were sitting in chairs arranged in a circle.
3023,justice,these women talked of the justice islam offered women.
3024,sharia,"“the girls handed it out yesterday,” ghoufran said to her mother, “the ones who are going to teach me about sharia.” olfa saw no reason to oppose this."
3025,state,"with her father out of the picture, no man had ever concerned himself with rahma’s dress, her well-being, the state of her soul, or even, frankly, her basic health."
3026,bully,"but rahma took salafi ideology and used it to become the family bully, criticizing olfa and the younger girls for doing everything wrong—for not waking up for the dawn prayer, for wearing tight clothes, watching haram television, listening to haram music."
3027,where,"sister, i’ve explained to you, they need to attend classes as well; this is where their real learning takes place."
3028,taken,"her interpretation of the salafism her daughters had taken up was that, while stultifying and severe, it promoted chastity and good islamic morals."
3029,case,"olfa’s working life was a one-woman case study in the challenges of the sousse labor market: there was little work, and the little to be had was strenuous, ill-paid, and impermanent."
3030,sharia,"at a mosque in central tunis, abu iyadh, the leader of ansar al-sharia, gave an impassioned sermon denouncing an amateur youtube video that mocked the prophet muhammad."
3031,building,they hung the black salafi flag from the building and torched the nearby american school.
3032,police,"police fought to keep the protesters back and the president sent the presidential guards, who killed two and injured nearly thirty protesters."
3033,sharia,"the video, and the ensuing protests, had led to bloodshed across the region: four days prior, militants affiliated with ansar al-sharia in libya had attacked a u.s. diplomatic compound in benghazi, killing the ambassador and three other americans."
3034,law,the american ambassador recounted a dinner invitation to the home of the president’s son-in-law.
3035,law,"the mansion’s infinity pool was filled through a lion’s head, roman columns lined the terrace, and frescoes adorned the ceiling; the son-in-law kept a pet tiger called pasha, who consumed four chickens a day."
3036,law,"the western-backed regime was so brazen that the son-in-law felt at ease telling a french newspaper, “i’ve got ferraris, limousines, but nothing gives me a hard-on, not even my wife, like a boat."
3037,term,"ennahda, the islamist party elected after the revolution, sought to allay people’s fears; its leader rachid ghannouchi said that “with time, such extremism will vanish.” this view was born of his long years in islamist movements, witnessing countless young hotheads mellow with time through long-term engagement with politics."
3038,criminalize,"the committee writing the constitution was deciding whether to criminalize blasphemy, which meant outlawing the defamation of god or islam."
3039,sharia,"in the end, facing ferocious pushback from secular parties and civil society groups, ennahda abandoned  most of its legislative aims; it dropped any reference to sharia as a source of law; its leadership rejected a proposed law that would have forbidden former members of the ruling party under ben ali to run for parliament."
3040,officers,"in egypt, in a coup that was backed by saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, military officers had recently overthrown the democratically elected islamist government of mohammed morsi; the army and security forces killed approximately a thousand protesters in a single day."
3041,state,"he sent pictures of a man called jafer, who had traveled to syria to join a group that was working to build a new islamic society, an islamic state."
3042,state,"jafer described what life was like in the new islamic state, how the authorities were trying to take over local municipalities, establish schools, and provide the kind of fair governance people had been missing."
3043,war,traveling to a war zone to secure a new life did not seem an extreme decision.
3044,war,lina had grown up in lebanon in the 1980s during the civil war; conflict and instability were not unfamiliar to her.
3045,law,"she clearly would have preferred a turkish daughter-in-law, one who shared her language, who came from an intact clan known to them, who could be relied upon to keep selim integrated into the family, and who held the promise of wishing to learn to stuff peppers."
3046,guard,selim’s father worked as a security guard at a train station.
3047,law,"dunya, like any woman who feels judged and rejected by her mother-in-law, began to project onto selim’s parents a family dynamic that merged with her own pique: the mother overruled everyone, determined how everyone would feel about life in germany, about faith, about everything."
3048,state,"selim’s mother was a typical kemalist, the type of turk who worshipped mustafa kemal atatürk, the twentieth-century modernizer who ended the ottoman caliphate and founded the secular turkish state."
3049,state,"selim’s mother considered herself a muslim, as well as a devoted turkish nationalist and a strong believer in the secular nation-state."
3050,state,"real muslims didn’t believe in the nation-state, and they certainly didn’t venerate secular politicians above the faith.)"
3051,authority,"selim’s mother claimed a cultural authority over islamic knowledge, even though she didn’t cover her hair and never prayed."
3052,law,"in that moment, dunya’s mother-in-law seemed to her like atatürk and hitler rolled into one authoritarian, thimble-sized figure."
3053,where,"after this first visit where dunya wore the niqab, selim’s mother barred her from the house."
3054,where,"emma/dunya  summer 2014, frankfurt, germany “this message is to the free women of mesopotamia in particular, and the women of the ‘muslim ummah’ in general: where are you from this holy jihad?"
3055,killing,"when he got home, he sat on the floor, as though the gravity of it all required him to be closer to the ground, and told dunya that bashar al-assad’s regime was killing muslims and that he needed to help."
3056,civil rights,but he leveled his criticism as a civil rights concern and evoked the historical struggle of african americans to organize and defend their communities.
3057,war,"when he criticized u.s. foreign policy in the middle east, the emerging war on terror, and the fbi’s heavy-handed tactics, he stayed carefully within a framework of legal rights and an ethic of nonviolence, an ethic he applied as stringently to states as to armed groups."
3058,state,"in october 2001 he maintained, “the fact that the u.s. has administered the death and homicide of over one million civilians in iraq, the fact that the u.s. is supporting the deaths and killing of thousands of palestinians, does not justify the killing of one u.s. civilian in new york city or washington, d.c. and the deaths of six thousand civilians in new york and washington, d.c., does not justify the death of one civilian in afghanistan.” some terrorism experts cite such views—which morally equate deliberate, state-inflicted military violence against civilians with attacks like 9/11—as evidence that awlaki was an extremist from the outset."
3059,alleged,"in the course of their surveillance, they picked up evidence of alleged meetings between awlaki and prostitutes, the disclosure of which would have destroyed his  reputation and ruined his life as a respected imam."
3060,war,"in march 2002, following a series of seemingly indiscriminate and aggressive fbi raids on the homes of muslims in northern virginia, awlaki delivered an angry, blunt sermon, warning that american muslims were becoming second-class citizens under the law: ‘‘so this is not now a war on terrorism."
3061,war,this is a war against muslims.
3062,war,it is a war against muslims and islam.
3063,war,"not only is it happening worldwide, but it is happening right here in america, that is claiming to be fighting this war for the sake of freedom while it’s infringing on the freedom of its own citizens, just because they’re muslim.’’ in the spring of 2002, awlaki left america for london and never returned."
3064,alleged,those who portray him as a silver-tongued extremist argue that he left the united states because he feared the fbi would go public with its alleged prostitute dossier.
3065,detained,"in 2006, local yemeni authorities arrested awlaki and, according to a new york times journalist, kept him detained at the behest of the u.s. government."
3066,tortured,"during the year and a half that he was in prison in yemen, awlaki was tortured."
3067,abuse,"upon his release, he said that fbi agents were present and involved during his interrogations, that they were aware of the abuse."
3068,guantanamo,"what we see from america is the invasion of countries; we see abu ghraib, bagram, and guantanamo bay; we see cruise missiles and cluster bombs; and we have just seen in yemen the death of the twenty-three children and seventeen women."
3069,torture,"in the words of one scholar, awlaki’s “radicalization is consistent with the historical pattern of activists adopting a belief in terrorism when political action fails to bring about change.” it also fit the pattern of islamist or muslim activists emerging from prison, where they endured intensive torture, with a radically altered position on the use of violence against civilians."
3070,torture,this is not to say that torture mechanically reshapes all individuals to make them capable of greater cruelty.
3071,cell,the thousands of muslims who had watched him online did not know what befell sheikh anwar in a yemeni prison cell.
3072,detained,"they did not know that he was detained on the demand of the united states, and they did not see what he endured."
3073,war,"after his time in prison, awlaki went on to inspire so many high-profile terror attacks that president obama felt justified in authorizing his killing by drone strike, the first assassination of a u.s. citizen without trial since the civil war."
3074,question,"tech companies eventually worked with governments to scrub his presence from the internet, but his lingering appeal to a new generation of muslims raised a troubling question no one really wished to grapple with: was anwar al-awlaki the source of militancy, or were his voice and biography, so complex and deeply human, just an articulation of its causes?"
3075,state,"she was also capable of understanding how it could simultaneously be true that anwar al-awlaki was right about everything and yet, that it was a terrible decision to go to syria and join the islamic state."
3076,murdering,"and there were other ways in which she sold the idea to herself: as the adventure of a dutiful wife acceding to her husband’s wishes; a journey to a place she had never been— syria, so near beirut, the stomping ground of the arabic pop stars she admired; a gun-slinging foray to fight against a dictator who was undeniably murdering his own people."
3077,authority,"when you were a single mother and had ceded authority to your too-young son, simply because he was a man-to-be, it was almost impossible to claim it back."
3078,poverty,"though their neighborhood was soaked in drugs and stabbings, and the obvious path out of poverty for most young people seemed to involve drug dealing or petty fraud, soheil and sabira received the kind of education that gave them skills and aspirations."
3079,cell,"“we had a lot to give back.” the brothers who offered soheil the leaflet were from a local cell of al-muhajiroun, a small extremist group of disruptive loudmouths."
3080,where,"the largest local mosque, on lea bridge road, was where most of the city council’s decisions were actually made."
3081,transferred,"the councillors handed down political influence among families, their networks of patronage transferred seamlessly from rural pakistani villages to this dense london neighborhood."
3082,building,this mosque shared a building with a community center and gym run by a community youth organization called the active change foundation.
3083,police,"for many years, the foundation had received government funding to counter the appeal of radicalism in the area; it offered young people a place to hang out, with gaming consoles and pool tables, but like many such groups, it also worked closely with the police and security services."
3084,war,"they sincerely believed in their political cause and were just trying to educate him, to awaken him as to how extreme the war on terror had become in its targeting of muslims."
3085,where,"in the spring of 2013, soheil watched isis propaganda videos that told him muslims could not live in peace in the west, in the land of disbelief; that they were fundamentally unwelcome, that they should hasten to join the group as it strove to create a caliphate where muslims could live under islamic laws, as they were meant to."
3086,sharia,"newspapers published a steady stream of coverage that encouraged people to think that the muslims they lived among were a fifth column, lurking extremists with terrorist sympathies plotting to impose “sharia law” and sneak halal food into the supermarkets."
3087,alleged,"the daily mail, one of britain’s most popular tabloids, ran a photo of the family home in walthamstow with a column that read, “just because britain’s border security is a mickey mouse operation, you can’t blame america for not letting this lot travel to disneyland—i wouldn’t either.” the mail alleged that the family were extremists, based on a link to a facebook account that ended up being unrelated to them."
3088,crimes,academic research showed and warned that mainstream media coverage of muslims was fueling hate crimes and creating a climate of extreme hostility.
3089,where,a leaked report by the ministry of defence in 2014 acknowledged that the government would find it more difficult to conduct military interventions in countries where uk citizens or their families originated.
3090,war,"it was a rare acknowledgment of how complicated it was becoming for britain to pursue strategic policies—support for the u.s. war on terror and israel’s occupation of palestinian land, the ongoing troop presence in afghanistan, lucrative arms sales to saudi arabia, and complicity in the saudi war in yemen that resulted in thousands of civilian deaths—that british muslims opposed."
3091,rape,"tabloids routinely found ways to portray islam as a religion of sexual violence, spotlighting marginal characters from across the world—figures that virtually no british muslim had ever heard of—and running screaming headlines like “islamic scholar ‘says allah allows muslim men to rape non-muslim women to humiliate them.’ ” or “egyptian lawyer says raping women who wear ripped jeans is a man’s ‘national duty.’ ” the british press ranked last in all of europe in a 2017 poll by the european broadcasting union that measured how truthful citizens perceived their media to be."
3092,racism,"these conversations tended to glide over the way racism in the united kingdom had matured, shifting from crude prejudice against anyone brown as a generic “paki,” to a more targeted discrimination against muslim people of color."
3093,authorities,"it was an ordinary, slightly grimy northeast london village-suburb, but it was a microcosm of everything that british authorities faced in dealing with the threat of radicalism."
3094,sharia,"he wanted to slap “sharia zone” stickers around east london; he organized morality street patrols that, in fact, no one attended but his own small band of followers."
3095,war,"but certain underlying truths were easy to empathize with: the belief that the west, through its war on terror, was waging neo-imperial wars in majority muslim lands; that with each year the war’s geographic scope and brutality, its secret torture sites and drone strikes and targeting of civilians, grew more extreme; that through support for israel and arab tyrants, it enabled muslim underdevelopment and suffering on a vast scale."
3096,state,"the tabloids called it “creeping sharia”; a prominent neocon thinker called it “the strange death of europe.” walter benjamin called it the “state of emergency” that had become, for the oppressed, “not the exception but the rule.” british muslims just called it life."
3097,state,"and as for the political views about the overarching tensions between muslims and western state violence, they were widely held."
3098,crime,the neighborhood was awash with drugs and knife crime.
3099,where,"soheil, like most boys, had learned to avoid certain barbershops that were hubs for drug dealing, where the barbers’ eyes were glazed over."
3100,guilty,"dealing drugs was a fast way to rise in the standings of the neighborhood, and the muslim kids who took this route assuaged their guilty consciences by pulling up to the mosque in their porsches and passing the imam wads of cash for charity."
3101,poverty,a 2017 bbc survey found that an applicant called “adam” was offered three times as many job interviews as an applicant with an identical cv and skill set called “mohammed.” half of muslim households in london lived in poverty.
3102,police,"— the police came on monday night, two days after soheil had left."
3103,officers,"there were two officers, a man with glasses and a fat upper lip, and a woman who looked around their living room and announced that they would need to search the house."
3104,where,"the hardest part, at first, was figuring out what to say to the rest of the family when they asked where he was."
3105,question,"who was she, to question his wisdom?"
3106,war,"but it was the early days of the syrian civil war, back when it was a clearer conflict with good and bad sides."
3107,sentence,but the version of islam the ladies at muhajiroun were dispensing at the meetings felt like a death sentence.
3108,where,"sabira and her cousin spoke about it one evening as they were walking through bethnal green, where they had gone to have dessert and look through the abayas at a local boutique."
3109,state,"—lowkey (the british rapper kareem dennis), “terrorist”  sharmeena, kadiza, amira, and shamima  december 2014, east london it was a truth universally acknowledged that all young women traveling from britain to the islamic state needed to go shopping first, and in that strange winter when girls started to go missing, westfield stratford, a sprawling mall in east london, emerged as a favorite final destination before the journey."
3110,where,"they had come straight from school, bethnal green academy, where they excelled in their studies and were admired by teachers and fellow students alike as examples of fine young women: intelligent and well-spoken, joyful and vivacious."
3111,where,"the four girls walked past the trendy steak place with the halal menu they would now never try, past the champagne bar where the bag-laden women took refuge, past an advertisement for the film american sniper (“the most lethal sniper in u.s. military history”)."
3112,ordered,"sharmeena needed a new mobile phone and some winter clothes, because it was already snowing in syria, the clothes she’d ordered online from forever 21 had not arrived, and she was leaving the next day."
3113,inside,"sharmeena was stunned it could happen that quickly, how a mother, still a young woman in her thirties, who seemed radiant and perfectly sound, could speed-decay from the inside."
3114,building,"it had a separate building for women, with a spacious, softly lit, warm prayer area on the second floor."
3115,inside,stepping inside instantly soothed her.
3116,where,"sometimes, after evening prayer, sharmeena would linger at the mosque and read a book, delaying the return to the home where her mother’s absence filled all the space."
3117,building,"walking past one of the cobblestoned roads that led down to the back entrance of the mosque, sharmeena passed an apartment building, one of the high-ceilinged factory conversions that made this  former garment district so attractive to young professionals."
3118,where,"the pilgrimage to the holiest site in islam, the city in modern-day saudi arabia where the prophet muhammad was born and received his first quranic revelation, was one of the five pillars of the faith, a journey required of all muslims who could afford to make it."
3119,where,"while they were there, circling the kaaba, walking the plains where the prophet muhammad, peace be upon him, had walked, sharmeena wept openly."
3120,state,"the strangers who had befriended her talked about the world in stark, finite terms: muslims pitted against the kuffar, the unbelievers; an epic global struggle of muslim suffering in places like palestine and syria; the urgency of building a real islamic state."
3121,state,"they told her there was an islamic state emerging in syria, where she could practice islam freely without harassment and live a life infused with deep spiritual meaning."
3122,state,"much of what sharmeena saw being circulated online, among the muhajirat, the female migrants who had already made the journey, made it clear that—if you were serious in your faith, in your commitment to other muslims—traveling to the emerging state was not exactly a choice."
3123,death,"sharmeena had stopped obsessively scrolling through outfit lookbooks on her phone and saying she wanted to be a fashion designer; another relief, which spared her father from having to say, “no, baba, we need you to be a doctor!” she did appear changed to him, more pensive and withdrawn, but he felt changed too, by the death of the person who had anchored them both."
3124,inside,he thought they were experiencing the same thing on the inside.
3125,term,"though she used the term haram, “forbidden,” her concerns for him seemed more worldly than ideological: his health was poor—he had diabetes and high cholesterol, both of which were aggravated by long hours on his feet at the restaurant, running plates in and out of a hot kitchen."
3126,war,"by that december 2014, the syrian civil war had been burning for nearly three years, ever since syrians first rose up against bashar al-assad in 2011, in the heady early days of the arab spring."
3127,building,"her new women friends spoke to her regularly about the horrific deaths of muslims in syria and the urgency of building a caliphate, as a means of self-defense against the violence and depredations inflicted upon muslims everywhere."
3128,state,"in regular posts, she described why she had left her family in scotland to join the islamic state struggle, urging other young women to do the same."
3129,injustice,"umm layth’s tone veered between the reductive stridency of a teenager who has just discovered injustice, and the plaintive voice of a vulnerable child far from home."
3130,detainees,"umm layth posted clips from a speech where prysner described dragging women and children by the arms and confiscating their homes for use by the american military, without providing any compensation; he described violent interrogations, putting bags over detainees’ heads."
3131,state,"this former american soldier said, “we were told we were fighting terrorists, but the real terrorist was me and the real terrorism is this occupation.” it was essentially what the american yemeni imam anwar al-awlaki argued: that state military violence against civilians was terrorism too."
3132,killing,"sharmeena began following other women to whom umm layth was connected across various social media platforms, their feeds converging into one loud crescendo of outrage against muslim deaths: palestinians killed in israel, u.s. drone strikes on weddings in afghanistan, u.s. drone strikes killing civilians in somalia, the children killed by assad’s barrel bombs, rohingya in burma."
3133,charged,"they were religious too—concerned with being good muslims, avoiding behavior that was impure—but their faith was more emotionally charged with political fury against the west than desire for spiritual awakening."
3134,war,"it showed a couple in the desert, a handsome bearded young man and his wife in full face veil, with a pink heart and the caption “the love of jihad: till martyrdom do us part.” at the same time a person called umm irhab, on twitter,  cautioned women against being made to feel like their commitment was somehow driven by sexual frustration or base desire: “i have never personally met a sister [in] sham who came here because of a ‘romantic thought abt war or bcos of a man’ we all came bcos of allah.” for many, the anonymous question-asking website ask.fm became a welcome platform to share views directly."
3135,question,"umm ubaydah, for instance, received this question: anonymous: i just wanted you to know that the vast majority of americans don’t hate muslims, & i want to apologize to you & all your people for the terrible things we’ve done, & all the families & husbands we’ve killed."
3136,state,we are trying to build an islamic state that lives and abides by the law of allah.
3137,state,"within the ideological worldview that advanced the notion of hijra to the islamic state caliphate, migration was not such an innocent or neutral transfer of location, for those who were old enough to be held accountable."
3138,state,"for the muhajirat from arab lands, many of whom had long adhered to strands of extreme salafi thought and who politically supported the jihadist solution to their societies’ ills and their governments’ subservience to the western state order, it was a less random choice, a hardening of existing positions within a political landscape where very little about what the group represented was unknown, in the face of circumstances that themselves grew more extreme."
3139,detention,"the argument in response often went like this: such brutality was certainly not desirable, but the west had left the militants no choice, there was no other way left to resist; nonviolent protest would not sway the dictator assad, whose military was torturing and killing scores in  detention centers, nor would it sway the united states, which had invaded and occupied iraq, killed countless civilians, and sustained and protected arab tyrants."
3140,law,"perhaps, as might well have happened if she existed in a more educated family and world, someone might have told her there were other avenues for dissent and other ways to help vulnerable muslims across the world: that she could devote herself to human rights law and political activism, or postcolonial studies or conflict reporting or humanitarian work."
3141,state,"bethnal green academy, the state high school that sharmeena and her three best friends attended, had an overwhelmingly muslim student body."
3142,injustice,"what was missing was a way for especially unhappy and especially intelligent girls to learn that the world offers many ways to dissent against injustice, beyond violent radicalism."
3143,war,"her father’s path was particularly jagged: he left ethiopia when he was sixteen, smuggled out after protesting the government’s war against neighboring eritrea; he spent six years in a german refugee camp before making his way to london."
3144,liberty,"but money wasn’t everything, and he made clear it was a blessing to live in a country that took liberty seriously and welcomed expressions of dissent."
3145,detained,"ethiopia, where he had grown up, was highly repressive, especially if you were muslim; it was the kind of country where the government bought spyware from china, listened to people’s phone calls, and detained them for weeks, calling their religious ringtones “illegal.” in the evenings, her father sat bent over the table, writing letters to protest the treatment of ethiopian muslims."
3146,slavery,"the conditions in ethiopia for muslims were and remain so dire that many fled to saudi arabia to work as migrants, encountering circumstances that were much like modern slavery: long working hours with no time off, beatings, passport confiscations, and other abuse."
3147,authorities,"in 2013, saudi authorities expelled more than 160,000 ethiopian migrants, setting upon them with machetes and sticks."
3148,detention,"they dispatched the migrants back to ethiopia, where many were tortured in detention, kept in underground holes for months."
3149,justice,"amira’s father took her to a rally outside the saudi embassy in london to protest the expulsions; people chanted, “stop violence against ethiopians in saudi arabia!” and “we want justice!”  when protests erupted in 2012 over an american film mocking the prophet muhammad, amira’s father followed a crowd from the mosque in east london to the u.s. embassy."
3150,war,"it was a friday when muslims across the world turned out to protest what they felt was a deliberate, racially motivated insulting of islam, originating in a country, the united states, that appeared intent, in the guise of its war on extremism, to kill so many civilians it had given up even counting them."
3151,where,"like so many second-generation muslim kids, amira grew up in a home where global politics were intimately lodged in daily life."
3152,justice,she had inherited her father’s sense of justice.
3153,rape,"at school, she was a strong debater, making the case for why muslim women had the right to wear veils, or how rape should be prosecuted."
3154,authority,"her sister, who was living back at home after an arranged marriage at seventeen, was the authority at home."
3155,where,"sometimes the sisters clashed, but at school, where kadiza excelled, she was well liked and admired."
3156,question,"as in most families, she measured shamima’s well-being by how she was faring at school: “you don’t question a child who’s done her homework and has got straight as.” shamima’s mother had asked her to start wearing a headscarf in year 10, when she was around fourteen; shamima hadn’t minded because her friends were all covering their hair, and she didn’t like feeling that she stood out."
3157,power,"like sharmeena before them, the girls all began hassling family members for watching television that was haram, but in traditional muslim families this was easy to mark as a dynamic of teenage power struggle."
3158,war,"like sharmeena, kadiza grew preoccupied with the syrian war, and asked her older brother what he thought about it."
3159,death,everyone whispered that the rushed second marriage was unseemly; couldn’t he have at least waited a year after his wife’s death?
3160,wall,"in their apartment, there was a textile with a quranic verse hanging on one wall."
3161,war,he didn’t watch the news or follow the syrian civil war.
3162,where,"he didn’t know there was a millennial honey-tongued blogger out in syria, umm layth, prepping young women for the caliphate as though it were boarding school: “regardless of how annoying and emotionally draining your parents can get—you have to keep ties of kinship and keep in touch with them….tags: enjoy raqqah teammanbij bring me my perfume he hehe.” on that december night in the westfield mall, where sharmeena was doing her shopping on the eve of departure, the girls finished quickly."
3163,death,"sharmeena had asked her grandmother for money, from the funds the family had been given around her mother’s death."
3164,war,"asma  2012–2013, raqqa, syria the war formally entered asma’s life when al-hasakah university, where both she and her boyfriend had been studying, suspended classes."
3165,poverty,"fleeing to turkey or europe was full of risks and unknowns: drowning, poverty, squalid refugee camps."
3166,war,"every war has its stayers and leavers, and sometimes the staggering volume of the latter—the exodus from syria formed one of the greatest mass movements of people in contemporary history—makes us think that everyone could have chosen that path."
3167,taken,taken together there would be 6.2 million syrians displaced within their own country— the largest displaced population anywhere in the world.
3168,assaulting,"the way it happened was simple: in the earliest days after the uprising, after the syrian military finished terrorizing a town, storming houses in the middle of the night and assaulting men before their families, they left stockpiles of weapons behind."
3169,torture,"to “militarize” a conflict is to humiliate and stoke the rage of protesters with disproportionate brutality, to detain and torture innocent bystanders or peaceful activists, and then handily provide them the means for a violent response."
3170,war,"there is no agreed timeline around precisely when this happened, but over the course of 2012 and 2013, the syrian uprising transformed and splintered into a civil war, and then a proxy war."
3171,war,"(syria had been the only country to support iran during its eight-year-long war with iraq, a conflict that ended in 1988, in which saddam hussein liberally used chemical weapons and iran lost a million young men.)"
3172,war,"these intrusions transformed the syrian revolution into a proxy war, where regional powers fought for influence."
3173,authority,"when saddam hussein’s regime toppled, the new orders that arose in its place, first the u.s. occupation authority and then an iraqi government dominated by shias, essentially cast sunnis out of public life; this marginalization provided a social opening for sunni militants, many of them saddam-era baathist loyalists, to exploit ordinary iraqi sunni grievances and harness them to their fight against both u.s. occupiers and the new shia-led government writ large."
3174,state,"the radical, violent groups that emerged from post-invasion iraq were distilled, by 2013, to the predecessor of the islamic state in iraq and syria, what we know today as isis."
3175,state,"its aim was territorial: to secede from iraq and occupy as much land as it could, pushing up through the collapsed border with syria, to form what it envisioned as an islamic state."
3176,war,"during the early stretch of the syrian civil war, raqqa had been relatively safe compared to smaller cities and towns across the country."
3177,conviction,"those who couldn’t, who didn’t have the contacts, the cash, or the conviction that one’s country could be left behind, decamped to relatives’ houses in nearby suburbs or surrounding towns, planning to wait out the worst of the fighting."
3178,detention,"those community leaders who resisted, or whose family and friends had the wrong connections, faced arbitrary detention, torture, execution."
3179,state,"foreign fighters, known as muhajireen, or migrants, began streaming into town—answering the call to fight assad, to build a state in god’s name, to find some dignity and purpose in the plains of syria that had been absent in their lives in europe or tunisia or morocco or jordan."
3180,robbery,"for a short period of time in raqqa, some residents said, there was little robbery or theft, no more shootouts in the street."
3181,taken,"it was in the year that followed that isis began to use theatrical violence as a tool: to draw more recruits from abroad, to instill public terror in areas under its control, to hasten submission in areas newly taken."
3182,crime,"the isis chroniclers remained obsessed with religion, vividly portraying every atrocity the group committed as some facet of islam; rape, that longtime tactic of war used to humiliate the enemy, became a “theology of rape,” an islamic sickness rather than a war crime."
3183,police,"following the sermon in central tunis that led to the violent protest at the u.s. embassy earlier that year, the police cracked down on salafi activists."
3184,police,"the women in nour’s group at the mosque were growing twitchy, worried about attracting police attention."
3185,war,"in that fall of 2012, the syrian civil war was still a just war, to many, a just jihad."
3186,case,"it was a clear case of a tyrant, a taghout, brutally murdering his people."
3187,power,"the collapse of the arab spring revolts led to an even more extreme regime of repression in countries like egypt and bahrain; for the autocrats whose power rested on their choking suppression of politics and civil society, their strict control of the media, it became imperative to ensure other countries did not provoke their populations by example."
3188,term,"the term itself, “islamists,” was a popular but opaque term that didn’t capture the breadth and intention of what such actors were up to: they were often simply socially conservative political oppositions, challenging modern arab nation-states’ failures—to oversee social and economic development, to endow the concept of citizenship with any meaning."
3189,arrest,but the tunisian police were too ill-equipped to make an arrest and produce forensic evidence showing who was responsible.
3190,power,"hundreds of protesters gathered outside the kasbah, demanding the ennahda-led government step down from power."
3191,situation,"the situation was ostensibly a domestic political crisis,  but there were forceful voices coming from outside."
3192,police,"but the police saw this as an opportunity to resume their old ways: harassing young men for the sake of it, imposing spurious fines that were just demands for bribes."
3193,where,"that night, walid walked past the café du théâtre, past the alleyways that led to darkened cellar restaurants where union and leftist party leaders had wine with lunch."
3194,building,tanks and barbed-wire whorls formed a cordon between the building and the street.
3195,police,"on bad days, it felt to walid like very little had changed: the police still terrorized you, they confiscated your car, demanded bribes for basic paperwork, turned your girlfriend’s family against you."
3196,justice,"on good days, he still thanked god that ben ali was gone, that there was a transitional justice process underway, where the former regime figures would be held to account in hearings broadcast on national television."
3197,sharia,"in august, the government declared ansar al-sharia a terrorist organization."
3198,police,"but ennahda needed to appear tough on terrorism, and the tunisian security services lacked the capacity to monitor and police the salafist movement with a fine-tooth comb."
3199,police,"the police were used to operating as islamist hunters, and asking them to do any different would have been like suggesting joseph mccarthy make investigative distinctions between stalinists and trotskyists."
3200,state,"he had a tendency to spit out abu iyadh’s name like the shell of a sunflower seed, blaming him for the attacks that triggered the state crackdown."
3201,state,couldn’t he have calculated how the state and the police would’ve reacted?” or perhaps abu iyadh had been doing global jihad for so long that it had become a part of him.
3202,ordered,marines ordered five iraqi men out of a taxi—a driver and four students—and shot them in the street.
3203,inside,"inside were families, including a blind old man in a wheelchair and children as young as three, some still asleep in their beds."
3204,war,"in his eyes, militant groups had no choice, in the asymmetric war in which they found themselves, but to target western civilians."
3205,war,they were up against a powerful country that had launched an ideological war in iraq and often deliberately killed civilians and feigned apology afterward.
3206,state,was that not simply state terrorism?
3207,state,"he came to believe that the developed living standards in the united states and europe were dependent on an economy of arab client-state management, of massive arms sales to dictators, military invasions, and the lucrative western-contractor-led rebuilding that followed."
3208,question,"how much is salafism itself to blame, and how much the armed, oppositional tendencies of the groups in question?"
3209,state,"others advance the idea that salafi jihadism flourishes in the cracks of state disorder, that many insurgencies around the world may inflect their campaigns and agendas with its language and aesthetics, but that they are fundamentally local conflicts that must be read and assessed within their own spheres."
3210,police,"those tasked with responding to and assessing violent acts—intelligence agencies, police, scholars, journalists—tend to hew to one view over the other."
3211,punitive,"the ideological reading tends to advance militarized policies—more drone strikes, battlefield onslaughts, and more punitive security policies."
3212,sharia,he pointed to ennahda’s retreat from mentioning sharia or even sharia principles in the new constitution.
3213,state,“their project is not to create a state where muslims can be religiously free.
3214,power,"look at them now, even though they’re in power."
3215,state,"if you go to their headquarters and ask for help, if you say you’re a niqabi girl harassed by the police, they’ll say, ‘there’s nothing we can do for you.’ ” apart from finding ennahda especially useless, abu abdullah didn’t believe in working within the state’s political framework in the first place."
3216,war,"this belief was at the core of many islamist movements, which originated after the fall of the ottoman caliphate at the end of world war i."
3217,state,"the idea of an islamic state—not the organization called the same in syria, but a modern entity that brought muslims together under one political banner—remained the ultimate aim of islamists across the spectrum, from the veteran jihadis to the new generation of salafi rebels."
3218,state,"that’s why you see the rapper, the praying man, the drinking man, the rasta man…all turning to isis.” but if there was a repaired tunisian system, would young people still be drawn to jihad or the pursuit of an islamic state?"
3219,inside,“young muslims have this instinct inside them.
3220,crime,"he was thirty-seven that year, but he felt as though he were living out his third lifetime: the first in corruption-choked tunis under ben ali; the second his escape to france, a nomadic existence where he tried to avoid the easy lure of petty crime; and now the third, here in the new tunisia, which made his heart tighten up, because if nothing opened up for him here, nothing ever would."
3221,where,"they were going to syria, where, it was said, you could make a living by joining the jihad."
3222,taken,"those choices and motivations were taken at face value; no one imagined that the young people going to syria didn’t actually feel these things, that there was instead some fuzzy ideological process called radicalization happening to all of them."
3223,court,"he held court in local cafés, explaining how online salafi sermons and targeted grooming had convinced hamza he was a genius (“hamza is not a genius,” he assured journalists who asked)."
3224,where,saber had a scar on his right arm from where a bullet had grazed him during the revolution.
3225,state,"imagine after that revolution you find yourself respected by the state, hired, doing well."
3226,police,"they think for him.” in the years following the arab spring uprising, many young people in kram reported stepped-up harassment by the police."
3227,charges,"the old regime’s methods of policing—trumped-up charges, no evidence, no due process, physical violence—had never really gone away; now they returned quickly, and with impunity."
3228,state,"mohammad ali was one of what was called “the wounded of the revolution,” protesters who had suffered bodily injury in 2011 and received a small monthly payment from the state."
3229,arrest,"upon his return to tunis, the police put him under house arrest."
3230,police,"to the police, this could mean only one thing,” emad said."
3231,police,"“the police think religious-minded people are the enemy, that they’re a danger to tunisia,” emad said."
3232,police,"it will take ten years, fifteen even, for the police to become republicans and not interrogate people’s beliefs.” in the afternoons, during the years after the revolution, emad often sat at an outdoor café on a  crowded street in kram."
3233,wall,"the wall across the road bore the giant graffito we fear nothing, always forward."
3234,where,"a quarter of tunisia’s population lived in poverty while a sliver grew more affluent; opportunity remained firmly out of reach to those not born to wealth or connections; the government could not begin to shape better economic policies, because the delicate political consensus that was keeping the country together, where the old elites had a stake in the new order, was too paralyzed to agree on and enact necessary reforms."
3235,state,"these scholars and analysts tended to hold discussions from about ten thousand feet in the air; they laced their conversations with words like “brainwashing” and “concubine,” and believed that religion itself, rather than state brutality or corruption, or some intermingling of all these things, led men and women to militancy."
3236,rehabilitation,one such academic had designed a “rehabilitation program” for jihadist returnees that involved sequestration and a deprogramming process that would alter their views on religion.
3237,freedom,"over dinner one evening, a refined professor at the university of tunis declared that democracy was unsuitable for tunisia, because until a population had absorbed the values of rousseau, it could not be entrusted with the freedom to vote."
3238,freedom,"his life was civilized, protected, and secure, and he didn’t seem interested in letting his country experiment with any real freedom."
3239,police,"why does no one ask why the media outlets and prominent spokespeople, all affiliated with the old regime, were making huge public issues out of the niqab or even just fleeting references to islamic law, when the revolution had been about employment and development and dignity at the hands of the police?"
3240,where,"is it not extremism to make a national cause out of nothing, to sow false divisions about such side issues?” the new tunisia was a place where the old grievances held strong."
3241,ward,"stoking fears of terrorism was a rapid, effective way to ward off the anti-corruption purges that reform required."
3242,murdering,did he want to save the muslims whom assad was murdering?
3243,war,"and by that fall of 2013, the syrian war had changed; it was no longer a just jihad, and walid tried to impress this upon karim."
3244,war,"syria was now a death trap, a war whose combatants and instigators twirled around in a space of funhouse mirrors."
3245,war,he had dropped into the war during its righteous stage and returned with the burnish of a warrior.
3246,sharia,"now that ansar al-sharia was banned, some of the women in her prayer circle were talking about joining isis in libya."
3247,where,"on the second evening, they went for a walk, passing through the park where it had all started years ago, the day she told the girls she would be the school’s first student to wear a niqab."
3248,sharia,"ever since the government had banned ansar al-sharia, the neighborhood committees that collected rubbish had disbanded."
3249,state,"it is the darkness that impels one to seek oneness, or union, or a state of getting close enough to god."
3250,war,"it is this quality that permeated istanbul, the city of islam, the capital of the ottoman empire—the last caliphate—which ruled from the thirteenth century through the end of world war i. stretching between europe and asia over the bosporus, teeming with mosques cast in golden light, the city is one of the most physically arresting, historically saturated, cosmopolitan urban theaters, vaster and more majestic than any city that might seek to compare."
3251,law,"not only about going to syria, but also of the prospect of running into her mother-in-law, who traveled to istanbul every summer to visit her relatives."
3252,law,"when they went outside, she would scan the street ahead, half expecting her mother-in-law to jump out of a shop and snatch selim away from her."
3253,where,it was past midnight when their car approached the stretch of border where they were meant to cross.
3254,where,"dunya wondered how many people had transited through this living room, wondered where they were now."
3255,gate,"there was a lanky man in flip-flops waiting for her outside the security gate, holding a sign with an agreed-upon name."
3256,where,"the next day, he drove lina and several other women just a mile away, where a minivan was waiting."
3257,building,"it was only much later that year, and into the next two, that the turkish authorities began to tighten passage, eventually building an imposing concrete wall along the border."
3258,police,he called the police.
3259,state,"a few hours later, they told him the language was turkish and that it was likely sharmeena had traveled to syria to join the islamic state."
3260,police,"later, scanning her mobile phone bill, he could see that she had spent several days in turkey before crossing into syria—days during which the police were aware of her intention."
3261,police,he would wonder why the british police had not coordinated with turkish authorities to stop his teenage daughter from crossing the border.
3262,where,"he asked where she was, insisted that he would come and get her, no matter what."
3263,police,"at bethnal green academy, administrators called the girls—kadiza, amira, and shamima, along with four others—into the office to meet with counterterrorism police."
3264,criminals,were they criminals?
3265,police,the police handed them letters to give to their parents.
3266,where,"she and kadiza, her bookish friend who excelled at school, shared images of injured muslim children in syria, and also myanmar, where the plight of rohingya muslims—which the world would finally notice in 2017—was already a focus of online muslim activism."
3267,war,"amira was transfixed by the extreme violence that accompanied syria’s civil war, a conflict that had raged without any outside intervention to protect civilians."
3268,death,"she posted a quotation of a young syrian boy’s last words before death, with the caption “this always gets to me."
3269,war,"throughout the syrian war, both the regime and armed groups used and invoked violence against women and honor codes as a way of galvanizing support."
3270,crimes,amira also grew more attuned to the vulnerability of muslims living in the west and the islamophobic hate crimes they endured.
3271,war,"she tweeted and shared posts about a spate of events that occurred in one four-month period, stretching from november 2014 to february 2015: three muslim students were murdered in chapel hill, north carolina; shots were fired at a montreal muslim school; a houston mosque was set ablaze by arson; a hijabi woman was thrown in the path of an underground train;  online anti-muslim vitriol was stoked by the film american sniper, which celebrated a soldier who killed many civilians in the iraq war."
3272,racism,"these messages sometimes segued into droll encouragement: “hijra just do it,” and contemporary images that embraced extreme modesty and yet also craved the public performance of social media, like a photo of two muhajirat posing before a syrian field, with face veils that didn’t even include eye slits: “my sister and i .” amira’s nascent understanding of how local islamophobia as a form of anti-muslim racism connected with global politics was intertwined with a new, assertive embrace of muslim identity."
3273,case,"she tweeted, for instance, about the case of omar khadr, a canadian child who was taken to afghanistan by his al-qaeda father and thrown into battle alongside the taliban."
3274,torture,"the u.s. military detained him in 2002, but rather than treating him as a child soldier, they interned him in guantánamo for a decade under alleged torture."
3275,injustice,"“sub han allah, the ummah is supposed to be one body….” amira shared quranic sayings that betrayed a pricked conscience; whoever had switched the light on in her head about injustice was also telling her that islam required her to do something about it."
3276,war,"sometimes the violence and war and conflict all seemed to stress her out, and this she processed, or was taught to process, spiritually: “those who are sincere are always in a state of worry.” threaded through all this nervous, intense religious-political banter was a thousand and one nights fantasy of what the east might hold in store for a good, pious muslim girl whose heart beat against injustice."
3277,building,"there were memes of an ak-47 twinned with a crimson rose, a bullet-riddled building in the background, with ornate script like a wedding invitation: in the land of jihad, i met you o my dear mujahid."
3278,death,"one girl from manchester tweeted proudly about the death of her fighter-husband: “he was a blessing from allah swt please make dua allah accepts him and i will join him very soooooon.” but life in the caliphate didn’t simply clang to an end once one’s husband became a green bird, the symbol of the martyr in islamic eschatology."
3279,state,"the islamic state cared for its widows, and there was always the sisterhood to fall back on, in the absence of family."
3280,taken,"any counterterrorism investigator reading amira’s twitter account in december 2014 would have immediately realized what was going on: a series of interests, inferences, and views that, taken in combination, reflected a teenager being cultivated by savvy recruiters with one foot out the door to syria."
3281,state,each post and tweet and image was a snapshot of her state of mind: i am getting political and pious and confused between the two; i am suddenly preoccupied with death and the afterlife; my interpretation of my religion is disturbingly narrow; i am looking to learn arabic; i am admiring jihadi scholars whose work i cannot hope to understand; i am in love with the idea of a handsome jihadi husband; i am in love with the idea of being in love.
3282,killing,"anyone reading her twitter account would have also been reminded that she was still a british child: “vans: yes or no?” “chelsea forever chocolate waffles, revision is killing me, this is westfield [mall] right now,” “picking your a levels is the hardest thing ever ,” “my new socks are so nice i  want to cry,” a photo of a tower of highlighter pens that she and kadiza built together while studying."
3283,ordered,"it was a teeming plaza of departing buses, each gate with its own small waiting room, not numbered or ordered in any manner, organized by men bellowing out cities (“ankara, fifteen minutes!”), overrun by families transporting banana boxes of produce and bags of crinkly brick-red peppers."
3284,stretch,"it was early evening on february 17 when they arrived, but their bus down to the syrian border would not leave until the following afternoon, so the girls settled in for what would be their final stretch of time in the land of disbelief, as they had come to think of it."
3285,where,"they took turns watching each other’s bags—they each had a backpack and a duffel—while they walked around, peering into cafés where travelers drank slim-waisted cups of dark tea."
3286,where,"it was a place where people transported all kinds of goods, where you would see many different methods of carrying a rolled-up carpet: hoisted over a shoulder, carried by two people like a log, propped on a wheelbarrow."
3287,arrested,"turkish authorities later arrested “john” and said he was a syrian asset working for canadian intelligence, documenting the names and passport photos of the hundreds of westerners he shepherded across the border."
3288,where,"they had both come to a place where there was extreme pressure to marry, and had held out."
3289,law,"don’t believe what you hear in the media,” layla would tell her new sister-in-law."
3290,police,— the police raids happened every couple of months.
3291,power,"what a sense of power it gave her, being able to provoke men’s reactions!"
3292,war,"he was a twenty-three-year-old man who had gotten used to war: the close scrapes and the intensity, the adrenaline and revulsion."
3293,war,"even if he didn’t agree with everything the war entailed, he seemed content to just get on with it, aware that all the doors that led back were closed forever."
3294,where,"they both knew exactly where he meant, though he always referred to malta as their destination."
3295,police,"a police siren wailed in the distance, the second one that night, a sound that in their neighborhood was previously like white noise, but tonight was suddenly startling."
3296,where,"they walked past sushi stands and a pret, where imran bought them popcorn."
3297,gate,"at the gate, they found seats together and she looked out at the clouds splayed against the moody sky, the airport trucks moving across the tarmac like little toys in a play set."
3298,officers,two officers pulled them out of the queue and asked them to come away for questioning.
3299,police,"the police didn’t know exactly what to ask; they didn’t seem to have much to go on, apart from the fact that they were young british muslims about to board a plane."
3300,police,"they stopped thousands of travelers under schedule 7 of the uk terrorism act, which allows police officers broad powers to stop anyone traveling through a port, airport, or international railway station, to question them for up to six hours and detain them for up to nine hours, to confiscate and download their private data from their phone or laptop, without any suspicion of involvement in terrorism."
3301,authorities,"in some years, authorities stopped as many as eighty thousand people under schedule 7, the majority of asian or ethnic minority background, and prosecuted only a tiny fraction."
3302,authorities,"critics called it a harassment and surveillance tool, one that allowed authorities to intimidate journalists or activists."
3303,police,"and yet, at the same time, the net failed to catch those of high intelligence value, young people known to the police as targets of isis recruiting, or young people in regular contact with known isis members already in syria, like the bethnal green schoolgirls."
3304,officers,"“who is this?” one of the officers kept asking sabira, demanding to know her relationship to imran, and where they were going together."
3305,officers,"they were sitting anonymously at the gate, amid the mostly lebanese and turkish passengers waiting to fly to istanbul, when two officers approached them."
3306,police,"this time, the police were more serious."
3307,officers,"one of the officers was kindly, but the other made sabira feel humiliated."
3308,charge,"she thought they might charge her with something, although she had no idea what."
3309,where,"“i know i have landed myself in so much crap.” she told them everything: about her health issues, about how difficult life had become at home, how one of her relatives was behaving abusively toward her and she could barely bring herself to speak about it, about how she had no idea where she was really going, that she just had to get away."
3310,officers,"“you silly girl, what were you thinking?” one of the officers barked at her."
3311,question,"but she asked herself a similar question: sabira, what are you doing?"
3312,officers,it was near dawn when the officers drove her home.
3313,police,"at the police, for taking away her fourth phone in a year."
3314,war,"her thoughts on a typical day before the war came to raqqa: should i do a master’s after finishing my degree, or get a job in damascus working with foreigners so i can improve my english?…is a keratin treatment going to damage my hair?…is amman so fun that my boyfriend will not want to ever come back?…should i learn excel or take a second economics course?…will i ever fly business class like in the movies?"
3315,war,"now that the war had come to raqqa, the tenor of her thoughts had changed: how can i avoid the attention of isis fighters on the street?…how few of these black sackcloths can i get away with owning?"
3316,taken,"as a female civilian in raqqa, asma felt as though her life had been taken off the circuit of the world."
3317,inside,"all of it was stifling: the faint smell of vinegar that clung to their kitchen, the mottled skin of her mother’s hands as she wiped the counters too many times, the solitude a strange contrast to the rattling inside her."
3318,authority,"asma had grown up thinking that as a woman she should be able to get an education, earn money, and have authority."
3319,taken,"her family was poor, but there was still enjoyment to be taken from life in raqqa, and they were not poor, as her mother liked to say, in their ethics and in their faith."
3320,where,"aws was into hollywood, where women shouted at their husbands and romance came with adventure: leonardo dicaprio, ben affleck, even tom cruise—she watched all of their films."
3321,where,"there was alraqqa bridge, where you could see the lights of the city twinkling at night, and gardens and amusement parks in the town center."
3322,taken,"until then they had mostly taken smaller towns and more rural areas, but mosul was a metropolis of two million, and a coup."
3323,war,"the nazi officers who occupied paris during world war ii wanted women, and the women—from brothel sex workers to coco chanel herself— eventually complied."
3324,inside,"she didn’t know how she would cope with a child on her own, but the desire inside her was so strong it overcame these thoughts, as reflexively as oil pulled itself above water."
3325,building,but now most building work had stopped.
3326,law,"some professions, like the practice of secular law, were simply dissolved; other jobs, like that of mri technicians, became irrelevant in a land where hospitals lacked electricity."
3327,charged,"the militants had started levying taxes, which cut further into many families’ already reduced incomes, and they charged the civilian community for electricity or gas at higher rates."
3328,state,"the most prominent and influential female ideologue within isis, a woman of syrian origin called imam al-bugha, spent fifteen formative years teaching religion in saudi arabia before she migrated to join the islamic state."
3329,where,"both women’s formative intellectual years had been shaped in a saudi environment where classical salafism and jihadist doctrine blurred; between them, they shaped and inspired thousands of isis women and girls."
3330,detention,"when a sunni insurgency eventually developed in response, the americans incarcerated militants in detention centers like abu ghraib, the site of storied horrific abuses."
3331,taken,she wanted to lean into someone and know she was taken care of.
3332,wall,"he never said no to anything she asked for, never raised his voice or looked at the wall when she told him about what she had done during the day."
3333,building,"her kitchen became the place where the other fighter wife in the building, a syrian girl married to a turkish fighter, stopped in for coffee."
3334,police,"because isis maintained a strict separation of genders in its territory (it upheld the view that women should not have contact with any men but their immediate relatives), it used a special all-women branch of the police to provide security, and enforce dress codes and controls on women’s movement."
3335,police,"many residents called it simply the hisbah, or morality police."
3336,state,"al-khansaa reflected, in various institutional forms, the growing and widening place of women in administrative, educational, health, recruitment, and propaganda wings of the islamic state."
3337,state,"its major tract, “women in the islamic state: a message and a report,” reviews the degraded status of women under secular feminism and western culture (“women did not reap anything from the myth of ‘equality with men’ except thorns”) and then outlines women’s rights, potential, and duties under the caliphate."
3338,detention,"assad’s regime forces were targeting civilians, sweeping into people’s homes in the middle of the night, assaulting men before their wives, raping women in detention centers."
3339,state,she found herself attracted to the idea of a real islamic state.
3340,bail,"it upset her that they hadn’t been more careful, and were now expecting her to bail them out."
3341,charge,"the intensity of the lashing, whether the woman was lashed through clothing or asked to bare her skin, depended on the whim of the person in charge."
3342,detained,"it was twenty lashings for the abaya offense, an extra five for the makeup, and another five for not being meek enough when detained."
3343,offenders,"many young women were becoming repeat offenders, calling their fathers to the station to pay and get them released."
3344,state,this state of affairs was making the rules ridiculous.
3345,freedom,"they appeared to have more freedom of movement, more disposable income, and small perks: jumping to the front of the bread line, not having to pay at the hospital."
3346,power,"it was appalling to her that a european teenager should have more power than she, an educated and formerly middle-class woman of raqqa, in her own hometown."
3347,inside,"once inside the car, speeding toward raqqa in the darkness, the girls talked quietly and laughed."
3348,state,"at this moment, they were still deferential and polite, but asma suspected that within a month they would behave like the rest of the western women who arrived in islamic state territory—brassy and bold, believing themselves superior to local women like asma."
3349,conviction,where does this conviction come from?
3350,where,"where do they think they have come to, these london girls?"
3351,law,"they thought they had arrived at the gates of dar alislam, the land ruled by the prophet’s law, where they would finally belong."
3352,law,they would soon find out that the caliphate ruled by abu bakr al-baghdadi troubled itself little with the prophet’s law.
3353,gang,"that his men used the ancient punishments meant to instill an otherworldly fear—the chopping off of hands, of heads—as bloody, nihilistic gang rituals."
3354,question,"asma wondered what or who had bewitched these girls, that they would travel all the way across europe and cross this desolate stretch of border in the dead of the night, in order to voluntarily become citizens of the place that, every day, made asma question the existence of god himself."
3355,alleged,"— one mild spring day, the women in dua’s brigade went to one of the city’s main squares to watch two  local women get stoned for alleged adultery."
3356,punishment,"the religion classes in her training course had dealt substantially with jurisprudence, and she had learned about the evidence required to apply this punishment: four eyewitnesses to the adulterous encounter, four eyewitnesses to the act itself."
3357,punishment,"her instructor had explained the intention of these old hadd punishments, reflecting the islamic approach to jurisprudence: the horrific penalty for such acts was meant to underscore their reprehensibility and prevent them from ever being normalized as “just human”; at the same time, the evidence demanded was so outlandish as to make the punishment virtually inapplicable."
3358,law,"in this way, she learned, islamic law regulated the public sphere: if a couple committed adultery, they knew to keep their own betrayal private, so as to avoid gradually tearing away at the sanctity of marriage for others."
3359,punishment,it was inconceivable to her that a judge would have been able to meet the evidential standards required to correctly implement the punishment for adultery.
3360,justice,she hated how the group prized slickness and spectacle over proper justice.
3361,state,it was in this strange way that the islamic state instilled in dua the awareness with which to repudiate it.
3362,police,"instead, she had showed up outside the main police headquarters holding up a sign that read yasqot al-tanzeem (“down with the organization”)."
3363,mutilation,islam forbade the mutilation of bodies.
3364,authority,"but now, the young women of the al-khansaa brigade had started using their authority to settle petty quarrels or enact social revenge."
3365,inside,"but i knew inside they felt differently,” aws said."
3366,inside,"the fighter didn’t even come inside to tell her the news; the car he’d arrived in was idling just outside, with another militant inside it, waiting."
3367,law,she called her sister-in-law in riyadh and they cried on the phone together.
3368,law,"islamic law, under all universal interpretations, holds that a woman must wait four months before remarriage, after widowhood or divorce."
3369,law,"but even here, in the realm of divine law, isis was disregarding the tenets of islam."
3370,state,"dua felt a sliver of loyalty to the islamic state as an extension of the loyalty she felt to abu soheil, who had been an upstanding husband to her, even if only for a few short months."
3371,war,"the loss of abu soheil, her neighborhood, the city, the whole country to a never-ending war of mercenaries and madmen—that was too much to carry."
3372,death,"was it because he anticipated imminent death, and so what was the point?"
3373,where,"back at her parents’ house, aws touched her old photos and books, thinking about the life she had had before, the evenings lingering over nargileh, the days at the beach, and how it all seemed light-years away from where she found herself now."
3374,where,"she and selim had parted the night before, when he dropped her off at the guest house where arriving women stayed, awaiting husbands who, like selim, were off doing their military training."
3375,state,"dunya viewed herself as superior to these unsophisticated young women, who seemed only to memorize the words and concepts that had brought them to the islamic state, without actually understanding what lay behind them."
3376,state,"even though the caliphate was intended to erase the ties of nation-state and tribe, most women still preferred the company of those like them."
3377,war,"the syrians viewed the british fighters as colonizers, and were bewildered by the insertion of these london-accented, brown-skinned brits into what was, to their mind, their local civil or regional proxy war."
3378,term,"that the british fighters lived in such exalted comfort over the syrians—their status in 2014 recalled that enjoyed by low-ranking english civil servants dispatched to colonial india in the midnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, experiencing for the first time the delight of structural superiority over others—was an unforeseen long-term colonial residue."
3379,racism,"but the racism they had contended with, the mocking in school or taunts of “paki” in the street, fit within the scope of frantz fanon’s belief that the “indelible wounds” of colonialism—and the racism it engendered for the descendants of the colonized living in europe—would take years to recover, and often resulted in acts of reactionary violence."
3380,courthouse,"when isis took over the city of manbij in the spring, they painted the courthouse black and imposed the jizya on local christians."
3381,power,"everyone agrees on this, even those who later renounced the caliphate for its wanton brutality, its devotion to earthly power and indifference to islamic procedure and values."
3382,war,"the foreign recruits, who were illiterate to local dynamics of the civil war and intoxicated by the compelling, sophisticated videos the isis media arm steadily produced, believed that everyone behaved mostly with goodness; the fluttering of the black flags still inspired a heady feeling of righteousness."
3383,charged,"there was a procurement man, a sort of virtual personal assistant, charged with dropping off pillows, duvets, anything that was lacking in the homes that had been occupied."
3384,state,"its inhabitants had no wish to be ruled by the islamic state, which had banned the simple pleasures that enlivened their rural existence: smoking water pipes outdoors, playing cards in cafés, listening to music."
3385,where,"in larger cities where isis had established a municipal presence, local residents had learned to be fearful and deferential."
3386,where,"but in small villages like this one, where the group’s administrative presence was light and there were fewer or no public displays of violence, locals were more openly hostile."
3387,where,"“where are you from, anyway?” the doctor finally asked her."
3388,power,the idea that dunya could mess with the woman’s life gave her a satisfying sense of power; deciding not to gave her a satisfying sense of benevolence.
3389,war,"lina and jafer were content enough with their new marriage, but the war around them grew more intense by the day, and tal afar was witnessing increasingly heavy bombardment from the u.s.-led coalition."
3390,execution,"if isis were to catch them, it would be certain execution for him."
3391,building,"about eight months after they arrived in tal afar, one such air strike ripped through the building where he was stationed."
3392,imprisoned,to be imprisoned with his body in that state of pain and addiction was unthinkable to him.
3393,state,"there weren’t many outings for women permissible under the islamic state, save going to the doctor."
3394,where,"for dunya, who spent long days waiting for selim to return from fighting, superfluous doctor’s visits became a mode of socializing and clinics became de facto social spaces where women gathered, lingered, chatted, gossiped, and took the measure of other women in their city, distilling all the casual human interaction they were meant to have in the course of a week into a couple of voracious hours at a medical office, pretending to have a mole examined."
3395,state,"and because moving to the islamic state required no actual capital for initiation—unlike cosmopolitanism in western societies, which was predicated on being able to afford travel and lifestyle goods—in its own unlikely manner, the caliphate dream was the very height of accessible cosmopolitanism."
3396,state,"in the west, the islamic vision of a state centered around social justice—the idea that society should be ordered such that every citizen has access to a decent quality of life—shared some commonalities with other political currents."
3397,state,"it is said that everyone wants freedom most of all, but if the arab spring and the bewildering appeal of the islamic state suggested anything, it was that freedom meant quite little if unaccompanied by dignity and meaning."
3398,state,"in the months and short years before it became clear that the islamic state was a morass of atrocities and gratuitous violence, there were elements of its overture that resonated with young muslims around the world."
3399,assault,"and for long stretches, before the assault on major isis strongholds began in earnest in 2016, many women in many areas could access a doctor."
3400,charge,initially the doctor worked closely with isis and didn’t charge for her services.
3401,state,"women just had to show their (pictureless) islamic state id cards, which also secured them free medicine from the pharmacy and free baby formula."
3402,authorities,"but after about a year, the gynecologist fell out with the isis authorities."
3403,ordered,"“leave that gun on the table, please,” she ordered dunya."
3404,thug,there was a certain romance to guns in the thug-life culture she had grown up around.
3405,crime,"in her rough neighborhood in frankfurt, everyone had internalized the codes of the godfather, used names like corleone in their facebook profiles, and shared memes of passionate moments in italian crime dramas."
3406,building,"for young people like dunya, growing up on the margins of german society in fractured families, building up some bravado through street culture was second nature."
3407,juvenile,"when he was young, his mother and stepfather sent cuspert to a home for juvenile delinquents."
3408,authority,a grudge against authority and american heavy-handedness emerged as themes in his life and music.
3409,gang,"then he assumed the name abu maleeq, and joined a street gang in berlin, composed mostly of turkish and arab young men who tussled with neo-nazis."
3410,racism,"in germany it was mainly second-generation arab, turkish, and kurdish boys who produced rap music, searching for identity between two cultures and coping with racism and discrimination."
3411,crime,"the hip-hop community took in cuspert with open arms, hoping he would get out of crime."
3412,where,"it is discomfiting, because it runs at such crosscurrents to acceptable opinion in the west, where political violence of many varieties had long been referred to as “terrorism.” terrorism, as the word is presently used, is a condition of ideological wickedness, stripped of any rational or legitimate context or motivation, and associated culturally with islam and racially with muslims."
3413,state,"at the u.s. state department’s terrorism conference in 1974, the american scholar lisa stampnitzky notes, terrorism was recognized as “the production of frustrations induced by unresolved grievances” and a tactic that could be used by “established regimes.” but by the late 1970s, terrorism had become a tool confined to nonstate actors, driven by motivations whose political or socioeconomic basis was “doubtful.” stampnitzky argues that we stopped trying to understand and diagnose political violence when the political violence began to spread."
3414,war,"these experts sought to promote the idea, which culminated after 9/11 in the war on terror, that the west was up against enemies of such unfathomable evil that engaging with their causes or motivations was pointless, and that virtually anything the national security state did to combat them, including a dramatic rise in civilian deaths, was justified."
3415,killing,it enabled secondgeneration muslim kids to inherit this narrative of grievance while also internalizing that none of it excused killing civilians in the west.
3416,killing,"it was the struggle of all such families to explain to their children that they could simultaneously feel revulsion for the violence of september 11 and also a glimmer of schadenfreude; that osama bin laden could be valorized for his intentions, but that his means were grotesque, deviant, and impermissible; that islam did not allow and would never allow the killing of civilians."
3417,law,"it was not so much, then, that people like the rapper denis cuspert and dunya were “brainwashed” into an “ideology” of radicalism; they simply lacked the intellectual and psychological coping skills to channel their newly found beliefs into more productive and legal means: activism, charity work, human rights law, citizen journalism."
3418,injustice,they were not raised to understand that the correct response to terrible injustice was not wanton violence.
3419,where,they all knew where the lines were.
3420,penalty,"in one propaganda video, he held the severed head of a man who had received the “death penalty” for fighting against isis."
3421,inside,"dunya and the other german woman rose to take her inside the house, offering her grapes and cold water."
3422,war,"once alone, dunya and the other women rolled their eyes and talked in low voices, agreeing it was just like abu talha to get some barely practicing muslimah who was pretty and slim enough to be a model to come out to a war zone for him."
3423,where,"when they walked back into the living room, where they’d left her dozing on the sofa, the blonde was rather more alertly examining a bookshelf and seemed startled to see them."
3424,killing,when you were so hungry you thought you couldn’t take it anymore and felt like killing anyone who took the wrong tone?” abu osama’s wife was unconvinced.
3425,sentence,"they reported that greene was prosecuted upon her return to the united states and served two years in prison on a reduced sentence, in exchange for cooperation with government officials."
3426,state,"partially unsealed documents from her case include a memo from a prosecutor in the u.s. attorney’s office writing that she had put national security at risk by “exposing herself and her knowledge of sensitive matters to those terrorist organizations,” but that she managed to “escape from the area unscathed, and with apparently much of that knowledge undisclosed,” a “stroke of luck or a measure of the lack of savvy on the part of the terrorists with whom she interacted.” if this was truly the case, greene would be the first and only american who experienced anything approaching “a stroke of luck” at the hands of isis, and it would certainly be one of the rare instances when the finely tuned, twenty-first-century militia-cum-state showed a “lack of savvy,” especially given  that greene disclosed to abu talha that she worked for the fbi."
3427,police,shamima’s sister finally decided to ring the police.
3428,police,"the next morning, police officers visited each family and said the girls had flown to turkey."
3429,police,"in the days that followed, the full circumstances leading up to the disappearance of their daughters emerged to the families: that their best friend sharmeena hadn’t just “disappeared” but had traveled to syria to join isis; that the school and the police had neglected to share this with them, and had tasked the girls themselves with bringing letters home."
3430,officers,"the officers would show up at their houses with detailed, endless questions, and little information about the girls’ movements."
3431,police,"the families began to feel like the police were vacuuming their lives and minds for intelligence, but were uninterested in actually getting the girls back—girls who were schoolchildren, who were british citizens."
3432,police,"as kadiza’s sister was going through her room, she found the letter from the police tucked inside a schoolbook."
3433,police,"through conversations with the liaison officers assigned to them by the police, it became clear that when sharmeena disappeared in december, what had begun as a missing-person investigation quickly turned into a counterterrorism investigation."
3434,police,their daughters had been questioned twice at school by counterterrorism police without their parents’ knowledge.
3435,police,"when kadiza’s sister confronted one of the police officers, he told her the girls had been “giving him the run-around.” she was incensed."
3436,police,"since when did teenage girls “run around” the most highly trained, competent police force in europe?"
3437,police,finally the families stopped speaking to the police altogether.
3438,lawyer,"the mosque introduced them to a lawyer, tasnime akunjee, who specialized in counterterrorism cases."
3439,authorities,the uk authorities said they had sent an email to the turkish authorities with the girls’ names.
3440,case,"a right-wing commentator for the sun newspaper blamed the parents of “the syrian three” for not preventing the girls from “[scurrying] off to be brides of jihad, sporting nothing more than a burka and industrial lubricant.” he demanded that the government drop its efforts to bring them back: “given we know where the syrian three are, maybe we should leave them to get on with epilating their leg hair and pleasuring spawn of satan, and focus on our own missing kids?” and so it was: voices in the media made the case that kadiza, amira, and shamima were no longer our own kids; their britishness evaporated, as though it had never existed in the first place."
3441,police,"once the newspapers discovered that amira’s father had attended political rallies in london— protesting the mass saudi expulsion of ethiopians, protesting against the american film mocking the prophet muhammad—they annulled his right to blame the police for any negligence."
3442,conviction,"— among the muslim community, in living rooms and dining rooms across london, the conviction grew  that a failure of such massive proportions was simply inconceivable."
3443,police,"the families were so distraught and furious with the police that salman farsi, the spokesman of the east london mosque, started acting as intermediary, though he too was stunned by the lapses."
3444,chain,"“people thought, they said, they let them go because they wanted to make a point.” or they let them go, perhaps, for the purpose of watching them and collecting intelligence, so they could better understand the chain of handling and command that scooped up girls from east london and deposited them into raqqa."
3445,inside,"or even, the family’s lawyer suggested, to boost the status of whatever mole the uk security services already had inside isis."
3446,charged,"if anything, prevent, the government’s counterterrorism policy charged with identifying young people at risk of extremism, was primed to overreact."
3447,officers,"how had officers failed to act when shamima contacted umm layth, a known isis recruiter?"
3448,situation,"“if the police were aware of this situation, if the school was aware, how were these schoolgirls then subsequently allowed to stroll out of britain and travel to turkey?"
3449,situation,"like many families in the same situation across europe, they did not feel the police were interested in helping them get their girls back."
3450,police,"the police confiscated the mobile phones of other girls at the school, girls who they knew were in contact with kadiza, shamima, and amira after they left; they returned the phones, presumably bugged, to monitor their contact even more closely."
3451,law,"though much of serious academia rejects the notion of “radicalization”—there is no empirical basis for predicting when an individual will commit acts of violence—the approach generally followed by law enforcement, whatever its flaws, follows the “bunch of guys” theory: the idea that young people join radical groups through peer pressure and in clusters."
3452,police,the police started applying this thinking after the bethnal green girls had left.
3453,police,"when a parliamentary committee held a hearing to examine the failures—misstep after misstep, each lapse more implausible than the last—the commissioner of the metropolitan police said he was “sorry” the letters had never made it home, and the head of the committee said it was “a big blow to the credibility of what is supposed to be…the best police service in the world.” the girls had funded their journey with a sizable amount of cash and with considerable logistical support."
3454,lawyer,"“this was not a package holiday,” the families’ lawyer said."
3455,police,"jewelry, the police finally said."
3456,taken,the girls must have taken gold and sold it.
3457,taken,"with the exception of one girl, who’d taken two gold bangles, the girls had left behind even their jewelry."
3458,police,they obliged: it was the police’s fault!
3459,institution,"the bribery and the payments corrupted the story, clouding a clear picture of which institution should be most accountable."
3460,question,"“who is big toe?” kadiza responded: “lol, our cousin.” when kadiza got in touch again the next day, she said she was staying in a comfortable house, “with chandeliers.” when her sister asked if she was getting married, kadiza chafed at the question."
3461,police,"i’m not here just to get married to someone.” but when pressed, she said she was “considering.” her sister told her the police had promised the family that if the girls came home, they would not be prosecuted."
3462,police,"in east london alone, police  confiscated the passports of around thirty schoolgirls believed to be at risk of traveling to syria."
3463,state,khan’s slow rise into the limelight coincided with the steady intensification of the state’s prevent counterterrorism strategy.
3464,incarcerated,"by the mid-2010s, british muslims found themselves disproportionately incarcerated and targeted at airports and borders; they saw their strongly performing faith-based schools scrutinized and shut down for often minor or exaggerated lapses; and, most frighteningly, they found the state increasingly willing to take their children away, on grounds of safeguarding them against radicalization."
3465,state,"these very real anxieties underpinned much of the concern about prevent, but khan accused what she called an “anti-prevent lobby” pushed by “islamists” of creating a “toxic” climate and narrative about the state’s strategy, a strategy she insisted was largely working and needed."
3466,war,"ricu produced what it called “strategic communications,” or, in cold war parlance, propaganda, aiming “to effect behavioral and attitudinal change,” according to its own documents."
3467,term,"the term “the muslim community” was problematic, khan regularly pointed out, as it glossed over all the diversity, rifts, and contradictions among britain’s almost three and a half million muslims."
3468,state,"but if this monolith called “the community” had one thing in common, it was resentment at being manipulated,  increasingly treated by the state as a security threat and second-class citizens."
3469,officers,social workers later turned out to be counterterrorism officers.
3470,state,"teachers handed out surveys to kids in primary schools with large muslim intakes, asking them questions about god and identity, in what later emerged to be a state effort to “identify the initial seeds of radicalization with children.” it was precisely such an atmosphere that made muslims resent the rise of khan."
3471,state,what the state presented as engagement with muslims was largely just a conversation with itself.
3472,charged,"as early as 2014, a female muslim blogger wrote that khan had “really lost the plot, from a reasonably islamically grounded muslim to, well, a frankly confused stooge who has completely lost her way.” by late 2015, a popular labour mp called khan’s group “the most loathed organization among muslim communities,” and in 2018, the former chairwoman of the conservative party called khan a “home office mouthpiece.” the government nonetheless appointed her commissioner for countering extremism, charged with, ironically, community engagement."
3473,war,muslim activists pointed to the war on terror and harassment by the security services.
3474,racism,white feminists blamed toxic masculinity and “intimate terrorism.” the mother of a young woman who left for syria said smalltown racism and her ex-husband were to blame: “he is a villain.
3475,court,"it would not be discussed that the authorities had confiscated the passports of several other girls from the school and made them wards of court, a designation that made the family court system their ultimate legal guardians, without whose permission they could not leave the country."
3476,police,"someone could have helped the students of bethnal green academy to make some sense of it all, but making sense of it, as some students would discover later, was dangerously too close, in the eyes of the police and other community authorities, to sympathizing."
3477,where,"amira responded only with “loool.” when asked whether the tourists were innocent, she advised the reporter to “research, like read about it.” the newspaper splashed amira’s face on its front cover, a hammed-up photo from her school days where her eyes are rolled back in mock comic horror."
3478,taken,"above him the headline screamed, “1 in 5 brit muslims’ sympathy for jihadis.” the headline distorted the findings of a survey about british muslim political opinion, which had asked people to what extent they had sympathy with “young muslims who leave the uk to join fighters in syria.” the government press regulator said the paper had conflated many things that were not equal at all: traveling to syria versus going there to fight; sympathy for those individuals having taken such a path versus support for their actions there; the terms fighters and isis."
3479,corrections,"its conditions for investigation were so finicky that it regularly passed over complaints; it imposed no fines, and when it told papers to make corrections, it demanded neither apology nor any placement of prominence."
3480,locked,"the city of zawiya was locked in confrontation with other armed groups, and the girls’ households were associated with the local militia that ruled the city."

3482,where,"olfa knelt down and began kissing rahma’s feet, weeping and begging her daughter, “tell me where she’s gone, don’t take your sister away from me.” “calm down,” rahma’s employer told olfa."
3483,roads,"“listen, girl, we can dispatch to checkpoints on all roads going out of this city, but we need a scrap from you."
3484,where,"tell me right now where your sister has gone.” rahma slipped a hand into her pocket, waved a scrap of paper with a phone number, and shoved it into her mouth."
3485,police,"back in tunis, the weeks that followed were a blur of meetings in police stations and lawyers’ offices and television appearances."
3486,police,"by this point, olfa told the police that they could do what they wanted with rahma."
3487,where,just make her tell you where her sister is.
3488,detention,"all i want is her sister back.” the security services interrogated rahma on and off for days, sometimes keeping her in detention overnight."
3489,police,"often the police permitted olfa to sit in on the interrogations, as rahma was still a minor."
3490,establishment,"but it seemed to olfa that the security establishment wanted the exact opposite: they wanted rahma  to run her mouth, to glean intelligence."
3491,police,"to show up at the security directorate every morning looking at facebook messenger, where she messaged with ghoufran, so the police could monitor their exchanges."
3492,power,or perhaps it suited those in power to let this fester and blow up (also likely).
3493,state,"the “sex jihad” coverage emanated from media outlets associated with either the tunisian security services or the syrian state, both of which were keen to portray the fighters and women flowing into syria as deviants or terrorists, or, in this instance, deviant-slut terrorists."
3494,establishment,"among the tunisian media and political establishment, there was no wish for a conversation about why hundreds of women were voting with their feet—voting against the failed promises of the new tunisia, voting against the present regional order—by going to syria."
3495,state,"he said dawla, the islamic state, struggled to recruit among syrian women."
3496,state,"for the caliphate to be able to function as a state, it needed more women, and they would need to come from abroad."
3497,power,"— in january 2014, ennahda and its coalition partners voluntarily relinquished power, facing sustained  pressure over security."
3498,sharia,"in may 2014, the new government banned the annual conference of ansar al-sharia, which they considered a terrorist organization."
3499,charges,"ben ali–era controls over the religious sphere continued, with imams harassed and prosecuted on trumped-up charges."
3500,state,"certainly some imams were inciting violence against minorities or political foes, but some were simply challenging the long-time hold anodyne state-oriented imams had held over the religious sphere."
3501,where,where are all the workers supposed to go?” many activists resigned themselves to a retreat from civic life.
3502,authorities,"by the accounts of security groups and the tunisian authorities in 2016, around six to seven thousand tunisian men and at least one thousand women had left their country to travel to syria."
3503,prisoners,"jamal later spotted him on an isis video, in the background of the shot, transporting prisoners for execution."
3504,freedom,"the point of freedom was that everyone could dress however they wanted, was it not?"

3506,inside,“you can’t come inside looking like that.” nour willed her features to stay impassive.

3508,where,"across the street from the café was a boutique hotel with an infinity pool, where the air smelled like jasmine and the bartender mixed gimlets."
3509,power,"“now it’s about the power of the medium, not the content,” he said."
3510,where,"la marsa was the quarter where affluent, foreign-educated tunisians and expatriates lived."
3511,where,"here, liberals enjoyed a comfortable majority, and as such, it was an active theater where emancipated secular women bullied emancipated religious women."
3512,law,"tunisians whispered that the weevils were a curse brought to tunisia by the son-in-law of the deposed president, the one with the pet tiger."
3513,injustice,"he remembered being taught a quranic passage in school, concerning rightful behavior in the face of injustice."

3516,police,"after karim left for syria, the police started “inviting” nour to have conversations with them."
3517,police,"this involved her going to a police station about twice a month, to sit in a room with a metal desk, usually responding to the same questions posed by the same unibrowed officer: why are you wearing those clothes?"
3518,police,"for a while, nour had managed to hide the police surveillance from her friends and family."
3519,police,no one wanted to be associated with a girl who was being watched by the police.

3524,where,"he lived with his family in a one-bedroom house in sousse, not far from where olfa lived with her children, and was finishing a master’s degree."
3525,justice,"with the fall of ben ali, he believed that society would move away from its authoritarian secularism and embrace more religious values and social justice in governance and public life; when that didn’t happen, when even the narrow openings for islamist politics closed off, he began spending time with some local young salafi men, who shared his fierce disappointment."
3526,war,"bashar al-assad’s war in syria, friends said, tipped him over the edge."
3527,inside,"his transformation was slow, and happened on the inside."
3528,conviction,he developed the conviction that violence was the only way to express them.
3529,camp,"the local salafis put him in touch with militants in libya, who ran a training camp."
3530,question,"his father said these young men infected seifeddine with “evil thoughts” and that he was a victim of “radicalization.” but in the words of olfa, who struggled with this question every day, “what is the difference between an extremist and a very upset muslim?” there was a thin invisible line connecting olfa with seifeddine."
3531,state,"he had been dispatched to the beach that day by noureddine chouchane, an influential senior figure with the islamic state in libya."
3532,where,"there was  a hub of tunisians in sabratha, in libya, where noureddine sometimes sheltered."

3537,inside,a friend inside isis agreed to get them out.
3538,inside,"her body felt itchy with fear, mostly for her friend inside isis, the fear of what could happen to him if it was discovered he had helped them."
3539,guard,"when she handed her id card to the isis border guard at the checkpoint, she was convinced he knew they were trying to escape."
3540,inside,"she tried to remind herself that her thoughts and terrors were inside her head, not visible outside her like free-floating ticker tape."
3541,war,"the  syrian war had permanently changed the face of the city, just as it had done to cities like istanbul and beirut; its central boulevards and thoroughfares teemed with impish, rumpled syrian children begging and selling packets of kleenex."
3542,where,"the pool adjacent to the ancient mosque swarmed with fat carp that were considered sacred, swimming in the spot where king nimrod was believed to have thrown the prophet abraham into the fire."
3543,state,"the gleaming new mall, piazza, seemed out of place, as though airlifted in by the turkish state to tutor local residents in buying shoes from air-conditioned shops, rather than the shoe heaps spread out on blankets at the mouth of the bazaar."
3544,war,"they missed their families and felt alienated and out of place in urfa, which felt about three generations behind raqqa before the war, and they hoped to move on to a more lively, modern part of turkey."
3545,where,she found pleasure where she could; she had recently had a brazilian blow-dry that took three consecutive days of treatment at the hair salon.
3546,war,"occasionally they argued about syria and the future, even though none of them knew when the war would end or what would come after that."
3547,power,aws saw no place for the intolerant sectarian armed groups in power.
3548,power,"but dua, more pious and conservative, had learned about islam only when isis took over, and wished to see religious politicians—moderate and genuine ones, certainly not these fanatics who used religion as flourish—in power."
3549,state,"her problem with isis was not that it had sought to establish an islamic state and impose islamic law, but that it showed disregard for basic islamic legal tenets."
3550,war,"dua had come to prefer jabhat al-nusra, or the nusra front, one of the most prominent rebel groups fighting in the syrian war."
3551,state,"unlike isis, nusra had not imposed a jihadist “state” on local populations."
3552,power,"this point of view was shared by many western states, which ultimately calculated that a jihadist rise to power in syria—either isis itself or the most extreme of the rebels—was a greater strategic threat than assad."
3553,question,"whether enough agreed to tip the balance in assad’s favor, absent russia’s military intervention, is a question people will argue for years to come."
3554,case,"the women avoided discussing the future, because when they did, as was the case one sweltering afternoon in the summer of 2016, their conclusions made what felt like a shabby, temporary existence seem permanent."
3555,building,"in the apartment of the free syrian army man who had helped them escape, where they gathered, a sour, salty smell wafted up from the sheep-brain restaurant on the ground floor of the building."
3556,case,"if the widows were widows twice or even thrice over, as was the case with many women, the problem of envy took on monstrous dimensions."
3557,state,"to be a widow in the islamic state was to be condemned to a rough, deprived existence in a guest house for widows."
3558,war,"in the midst of the turbulent war, these women coveted the protection of a husband who would provide them a home."
3559,state,such was the state of things in raqqa in 2017 that a woman like lina could be envied for a one-legged man.
3560,death,"lina was pregnant again, and she and jafer wanted to start over, to erase the memories of their baby boy’s death."
3561,ward,"lina and jafer went to see a local sheikh for a recitation of the ruqyah al-sharia, an incantation of the quran meant to ward off or dispel the evil eye."
3562,situation,"— lina was an adept coper, too adept, perhaps, in that she coped so hard and so well that usually when she  decided it was time to extract herself from a situation, it was well past the point of deadly."
3563,death,she had survived since the death of the baby by narrowing her world down to the island of her household.
3564,state,"perhaps the birth of the new baby infused her with some courage, or perhaps the encounter at the sheikh’s house made it apparent to her that the islamic state was collapsing; in times of desperation, people’s behavior would only grow more dark and unpredictable."
3565,imprisoned,"if he was caught escaping, he would be executed or imprisoned."
3566,detainees,"if they tried, at least they would have a chance; if they stayed, they would die in an air strike or be captured by the iraqi army or the shia militias, which were now rapidly closing in and reportedly executing isis detainees on the spot."
3567,law,"lina was to be the smuggler’s wife; her children would be their children; an old man they were taking along was to be his father, her father-in-law; and a fleeing fifteen-year-old was to be a deaf-mute cousin."
3568,state,"they were posing as an ordinary civilian family from raqqa, people who had no ties or sympathies to the islamic state."
3569,where,"if all went well, they would be allowed to pass into turkey, where they would be free."
3570,ordered,"the smuggler stopped the car a hundred meters from a checkpoint, ordered everyone to get out, and drove away, taking all of lina’s money with him."
3571,authority,"many of the foreign women thought that this, this fear they struck into syrians, was the correct response to their authority as isis women."
3572,inside,"but dunya could not adjust in this way; all these little things, the frightened stares of the children, the snubbing behavior of the local vendors, hummed inside her, reminding her she was despised and that isis might not always have the upper hand."
3573,state,many recruits had not expected that the islamic state would ask them to fight against and kill other sunni muslim insurgents.
3574,punishment,"but even the faint suspicion of not wanting to fight—or worse, wanting to leave—could result in severe punishment."
3575,custody,one german fighter told his friends he was considering going back home; within a week the organization took him into custody.
3576,tortured,"he was waterboarded and given electric shocks, and then sent back out with the hooded, grave look of one who has been tortured."
3577,state,"the islamic state leadership disappointed selim—he recognized its brutality and unfairness, but he seemed to be internalizing its extremism all the same."
3578,authorities,when the authorities ordered women to cover their eyes and hands in public—to wear face veils that obscured the eyes and black gloves in the heat—dunya thought he didn’t seem as distressed as he should be.
3579,law,"“don’t you realize by agreeing to the terms and conditions, you’re consenting to american law?"
3580,law,"kuffar law?” she couldn’t believe he was serious, and tried to make light of it."
3581,war,"are you going to make takfir of the spider crawling on that wall?” it was one of their first major arguments, and it marked the point when she began to realize that— apart from the hardship of living in a war zone, apart from the stretches of time he left her alone, without her knowing whether he was dead or alive—he was turning into a different person."
3582,state,"but as time passed, his personality grew more rigid; the austere rules of the islamic state infiltrated their daily life."
3583,state,the guest house for widows was a state of mind.
3584,punishment,"trips out to the market were tightly controlled by ill-natured house wardens, usually moroccans, who barked at the residents and withheld toiletries and other necessary items as punishment."
3585,where,"when he was out one day, she arranged to meet up with a smuggler, who helped her get to the turkish border, where she turned herself over to the border guards."
3586,state,"no matter what happened to the islamic state, no matter what ultimate fate awaited the syrians themselves, selim wanted to live an austere, orthodox islamic lifestyle forever."
3587,where,"ideally they would settle in turkey, where he could live among muslims, hear the call to prayer five times a day, and nurture the hope that one day, a better caliphate would rise from the ruins of the one he was fighting for."
3588,war,it was war.
3589,state,"did he know that in germany, there were state-mandated rules about the size of a hamster cage?"
3590,situation,"a german woman she knew was circulating this message: hello, this is an urgent message from besieged aleppo, buses are stuck since yesterday morning at check points, people’s situation is extremely hard, because of cold and shortage of water and food supplies."
3591,situation,as the situation can’t hold till morning.
3592,inside,"she felt fury mount inside her, and started texting."
3593,war,"“dumb asses go to kill tourists when the war is here.”  sharmeena, kadiza, amira, and shamima  december 2015, raqqa, syria kadiza, to whom the high school world of bethnal green now seemed the most elusive, distant memory, spent her days wandering listlessly through a dilapidated mansion in mosul, trying to figure out who among the widows remained an isis zealot, who was disillusioned, and who was the former posing as the latter in order to snitch to the isis authorities."
3594,freedom,"as a foreigner, she could move about with a degree of freedom, and was able to go out to the market and to internet cafés."
3595,justice,"the caliphate was not a land of honor and justice where muslims could hold their heads high, where the call to prayer filled the air and the pavement was littered with roses."
3596,war,"instead it was a vortex of violence and corruption where men hoarded cars and women settled scores against neighbors and foes, as though it were one long mafia war."
3597,death,rumors had spread that an austrian girl caught trying to escape had been beaten to death.
3598,court,"her husband tracked her down, had her prosecuted and imprisoned by a sharia court, and took their daughter away, to be looked after by his second wife."
3599,war,"i’m never gonna do that.” this part of the war was simple: the territory she had to pass through, to get out of syria, was controlled by groups that hated isis; she thought they wouldn’t hesitate to kill someone associated with the caliphate."
3600,where,"eventually kadiza managed to move to raqqa, still the capital of isis-controlled territory, where she hoped she could mount her escape under less watchful eyes."
3601,building,"umm layth, the teenage blogger from glasgow, lived in the same building, though she had stopped writing now that tech companies were finally patrolling isis content."
3602,lawyer,"kadiza’s family, with the help of their lawyer, used cellphone tracking to identify her position within a five-hundred-meter range."

3604,inside,"i want  to speak to mum.”  rahma and ghoufran  february 2016, sabratha, libya the american fighter jets flew over sabratha in the early hours of friday, well before anyone would be stirring for the dawn prayer inside the training camps on the fringes of the city, or in the houses in the western and southern districts."
3605,where,rahma didn’t know where to go.
3606,sentences,rahma began crying and speaking in broken sentences.
3607,guilt,"in the space of a minute, she had careened through her usual carousel of emotions: guilt, self-recrimination, and then intense frustration with her younger daughter, who—even now, even surrounded by death and destruction, with her sister in the hospital—clung to blindness."
3608,detained,"may 2016, mitiga airport prison, tripoli, libya after the air strike on sabratha, rahma and ghoufran were detained by the militia of the un-backed government that ruled tripoli, which had determined they were members of isis."
3609,taken,they were taken to the airport prison.
3610,police,"she told everyone who asked—olfa on the phone, the prison wardens, journalists—that she would rather stay in the libyan prison, where she was treated with dignity, than return to tunisia, to live in poverty at the permanent mercy of the police."
3611,police,"she had given birth to tameem in turkey and they returned to tunis when he was a few months old, but after endless middle-of-the-night raids by police looking for information about isis sympathizers, she traveled to libya to join her husband."
3612,authorities,"the libyan authorities were helpful, but the tunisians threw up bureaucratic obstacles."
3613,where,"what could you say about a world where your baby grandson was kept for months on end in a prison, because bureaucrats wanted to punish families for the path their children had taken?"
3614,state,"tunisia’s government, and many of its people, remained in denial about just how many tunisian citizens had left to join the jihad, because this was an indictment of the state itself."
3615,detention,"“we ask of god peace, and that is all.” a tunisian delegate traveled to tripoli in april 2017 to visit the tunisian women and children in libyan detention, but failed to meet with them."
3616,detained,"some of the children were detained alongside their mothers; tunisian authorities floated a plan to repatriate the children only, which everyone refused."
3617,authorities,"in october 2017, after over a year and a half of negotiations, the tunisian authorities allowed tameem to come home."
3618,taken,"his picture appeared in a newspaper with his grandfather, both of them grinning and flashing a thumbs-up, the first photo taken of tameem that shows him smiling."
3619,authorities,the authorities in tunis failed to bring home the other forty-four tunisian children held in libya.
3620,police,"the play conveyed what it was like to be young, muslim, and male, and to be humiliated by “random” police searches."
3621,war,"it had young people making beheading jokes; it included a devastating scene about mohammed emwazi, who became the executioner jihadi john, that seethed with condemnation, empathy, and disturbing reality (“i know kids like him”); it aired the indignation of muslim girls who were told that their religion was misogynistic; it showed that even teenagers knew it didn’t make sense for their government to be at “war with radical islam” while also “playing kiss-ass with saudi businessmen.” it leveled painful jokes about liberal islamophobia: “who’s more nervous than a muslim man on the tube?"
3622,police,"the police had asked to read the script, attend the first three shows, plant plainclothes officers in the audience, and sweep for bombs."
3623,state,"in 1968, with the passage of the theatres act, the united kingdom ended a 230-year-old system of formal state censorship."
3624,police,"since 1968, no play had been banned by a theater or the police without clear indication that it might spark violence."
3625,question,"a leaked email written by the nyt’s director faulted the play’s “one-dimensional tone and opinion” and accused the writer and director of an “extremist agenda.” various groups protested, from english pen to the index on censorship, which said the government had “created an atmosphere” that made arts groups increasingly nervous to tackle controversial subjects, “specifically the question of islamic extremism.”  but it wasn’t simply that plays dealing with islamist extremism were hard to put on."
3626,state,"indeed, about a year later the national theatre itself performed another world: losing our children to islamic state, which included the stories of kadiza, amira, and shamima as part of the narrative."
3627,state,"most of all, how could you allow them to reveal that while they rejected isis itself, they agreed with its overarching portrayal of the state of the middle east and its apportioning of blame on western state interventions and policies for that state?"
3628,freedom,"it was censorship, of course, but in the united kingdom of that time, policing was an imperative over artistic freedom or even, really, freedom of expression."
3629,police,"their disappearance raised many more questions than answers, but their story seemed to prompt one angry conclusion after the other, as everyone—the media, the police, prevent officers, muslim feminists, western feminists, human rights groups—vied to impose their answers onto the girls’ disappearance."
3630,building,"kadiza  may 2016, raqqa, syria an air strike ripped through the building where kadiza was living."
3631,inside,"she was inside, and died instantly."
3632,police,"sabira  spring 2016, walthamstow, northeast london after the rout at the airport, sabira spent weeks entangled with courts, the police, and counter-terrorism officers."
3633,taken,thanks for getting my passport taken away!—but decided none of them were worth the bother.
3634,wall,sabira felt the vibrations shaking through the wall.
3635,sentence,"she was obliged to attend the country’s highest court to learn her sentence; her father accompanied her to the courthouse on the strand, in london."
3636,court,"like dozens of other young women in britain whom the authorities viewed as at risk of travel to syria, the judge made her a ward of court."
3637,court,"she was grateful that everyone at the court treated her with respect and kindness, and that, apart from losing her passport and being barred from traveling, for a given period of time, to any muslim country, the united kingdom was giving her another chance."
3638,sentence,"had she been a young american woman in similar circumstances, caught by american authorities, it’s likely she would have been prosecuted under vaguely defined statutes around “material support for terrorism” and been forced to serve a years-long prison sentence."
3639,officers,"she underwent psychiatric evaluations and endured visits from prevent officers, who sat awkwardly in her living room and asked about islam and where she stood with her religion."
3640,situation,"sabira wanted to tell them she was fine, that she wasn’t a mental patient, that a terrible situation had occurred—but given the simplistic questions they were asking her, she was certain they would never understand."
3641,abuse,"didn’t they realize parents were sometimes hapless and didn’t notice abuse under their noses, and even if they did, they were often too cowed and worried about what people would say to do anything about it?"
3642,court,"but sabira responded with patience and humility, because she understood that both allah and these people from the court and the police had given her a second chance."
3643,term,"sabira’s long-term goals had always been to work productively, marry a nice muslim boy, and lead a comfortable life."
3644,state,"for much of the 2000s and 2010s, due to austerity measures, the state cut programs that were intended to help less-skilled immigrants find work and integrate."
3645,national security,"though most recent uk governments had resisted the european trend of banning face veils, by early 2016 both the ordinary hijab and face veils rose to become national security concerns."
3646,authorities,"cameron called on institutions like courts and schools to devise their own “sensible rules,” while other authorities made clear banning face veils in certain spaces wasn’t simply about sensible security, but also liberal empowerment."
3647,freedom,"a top education official, speaking about face veils in 2016, said that “our liberal west values” must be protected and that “the muslim community needs to listen,” because british society has come a long way “to ensure that we have equality for women” and “mustn’t go backward.” amid all of these rows and interventions, officials clearly never considered that for a vast number of girls like sabira, wearing a headscarf secured them freedom, autonomy, access to public space and education."
3648,state,"it was about how the state felt obliged, now that it had conflated muslim conservatism with extremism, to nudge the community toward liberalism."
3649,abuse,"there are suffocating proscriptions around marriage, problems with forced marriage, domestic violence, stark double standards in the treatment of daughters and sons, and taboos around confronting and reporting sexual abuse."
3650,where,"they behaved as though they were still back at home in bangladesh or ethiopia, where there was a surrounding cushion of extended family and friends supporting their parenting, casting a protective eye on all the children around them, because that is the way children had always been raised, collectively."
3651,crime,"in london, there was no such protection; there were gangs and knife crime, predators on facebook and instagram, whole collections of virtual and physical threats."
3652,poverty,"add to this poverty and broken families, absent fathers, unemployed fathers, fathers who couldn’t provide for and protect their families and marinated in that humiliation—realities that cut across all these girls’ lives."
3653,war,parenting of millennial muslims in the age of the war on terror demanded levels of awareness that immigrant parents often didn’t have the capacity for.
3654,state,"because the state’s understanding of integration was security-driven, it led to policies that increasingly aggravated the country’s muslims, who felt discriminated against, surveilled, and stigmatized."
3655,state,"the thorny fact was that the structural factors that bred extremism—the arab tyrannies and coups, western wars and state collapses that extremists exploited—hardly lent themselves to counterterror policing in the west."
3656,police,a young afghan british boy who attended school with a “free palestine” badge on his backpack had counterterrorism police show up at his door.
3657,inside,“the modesty has to come from inside you.
3658,inside,like it’s inside sabira.” it was late morning; there was a milky sky and two hours of driving before them.
3659,suspect,i won’t believe it until i see it.” it hadn’t occurred to sabira to suspect it could be false news.
3660,war,"on a certain level, it was simply inconceivable: to have ended up in britain, the daughter of a pakistani transplant whose family had abandoned its farm amid the violence of partition, to have done your best to raise a happy son over a difficult cultural divide, to watch him increasingly chafe at feeling british in a way you never did yourself, even though he blended in better than you ever had, to watch that son retrace half of your own family’s path eastward and end up fighting and dying in the arab levant in someone else’s civil-territorial war under the banner of jihad."
3661,where,"was he a martyr who died fighting for the idea of a caliphate, a kingdom of heaven where muslims could live in dignity under allah’s will?"
3662,death,what was the legacy of his death?
3663,injustice,"did it mean she had raised her son with a heart that burned against injustice, or that she had let him down, not noticing that he was being preyed upon?"
3664,war,"the image looked like the mangled syrian bodies they had gathered around their phones to look at together over eighteen months ago, back when the syrian war was beginning."
3665,death,"— in october 2016, short months after his baby was born, eight months after nadim’s death, soheil was  killed by a sniper shot to the head during an extended fighting campaign outside manbij."
3666,where,"i’m waiting for the afterlife, where we can be together.” the family’s mourning for nadim bled into their mourning for soheil, a period of counting days: the seventh day, the fortieth day."
3667,wall,"but if someone were to create a memorial wall of all the hundreds and thousands of bright, educated, promising, bighearted young people who had gone to syria, would it be possible to look into their faces and not see something to learn from?"
3668,case,"she knew of many others who had managed to cross the border into turkey, but while the german consulate in ankara said repeatedly it was working on her case, no help ever materialized."
3669,authorities,"the idea of winging it, just walking or driving up to the border and handing herself over to the turkish authorities, this frightened her, even though it was probably what others had done."
3670,detention,"what if they threw her into a filthy detention center where she had to spend weeks sleeping on a dirt-encrusted floor and eating gruel, surrounded by drug addicts and prostitutes?"
3671,authorities,what if they interrogated her for hours à la midnight express before turning her over to the german authorities?
3672,situation,"then there was the problem of her cats, only slightly less complicated than her own situation."
3673,police,"journalists who had her whatsapp number and called with questions; intelligence agents who showed up at the house pretending to be local ngo workers or municipal police, as though she couldn’t figure out immediately who they were."
3674,inside,"she poked her head inside the room if she didn’t emerge, tended to her when she got sick from bad kebab or had chronic chest colds."
3675,state,"the ypg was a syrian kurdish militia closely linked to a group that the united states considered a “terrorist entity,” but now, recently scrubbed and rebranded as the syrian democratic forces, the militia was working together with the american and european militaries to dislodge the islamic state from the areas around the east and northeast, now edging closer to raqqa."
3676,case,"dunya jumped up to wash off her face mask, in case the generator went off."
3677,escaped,"now that she had escaped from the caliphate, dunya devoted herself to wellness."
3678,stretch,"she made scrubs out of salt and honey, masks out of almonds and olive oil, and found that organic self-care could reliably fill a long stretch of the average day."
3679,war,"as for the war, it continued as the backdrop."
3680,situation,"she decided it was time to contact his family; whatever had transpired between them in the past, they deserved to be updated on his situation."
3681,state,"the islamic state faced an onslaught from every direction—from coalition forces, from kurdish fighters and the iraqi army, from the assad regime, from the iran-backed shia militias."
3682,war,"was it in the early days, when the war seemed just and right?"
3683,conviction,"they were the men of the purest ideals and conviction, who came to fight for god."
3684,police,"it was late spring of 2016 and her window, overlooking the street, was open a crack, so she could hear the police shouting as they pounded against her front door."
3685,locked,"she locked the door to her bedroom, panicking; she needed to hide her mobile phone before they got to her."
3686,police,"the police were in the hallway now, demanding that she open the door."
3687,where,"“i’m just putting on my headscarf,” she called out, fumbling with the wardrobe, where she stuffed the phone, wrapped in a sock, into a mess of clothes."
3688,case,your case is closed.
3689,where,"we just want to know where your husband is,” the officer said."
3690,ordered,"this was their leverage: they ordered her father to deal with his daughter, or else they’d make life hell for the whole family."
3691,officers,nour kissed her mother on the forehead before the officers escorted her back out to the waiting car.
3692,police,"the police asked her to reinstall her facebook account, and she obliged."
3693,police,"there were some salafi girls there, and the police asked who they were."
3694,freedom,"now, they were exercising their newfound freedom to request a very awkward thing: that society include and accept them in the framework of a highly conservative, orthodox vision of islam."
3695,police,"politicians scarcely knew how to respond, let alone the police, who looked at a woman like nour and, truth be told, just wanted to beat the disobedient piety out of her."
3696,police,"“they buy stuff from me, they’re my customers,” nour said, in answer to the police’s question about  the salafi women."
3697,death,"“exactly what does this mean?” she had posted, “there is no god but god, and mohammad is his messenger,” and underneath it, “my last words before death.” “you want to be a martyr, huh?” the policeman said."
3698,arrested,"those who she knew had been arrested before, she pretended not to know."
3699,arrested,"those who she knew hadn’t been arrested yet, she admitted to knowing."
3700,officers,"nour asked if she could go home, but the officers pushed the untouched sandwich toward her and told her not yet."
3701,police,"around the time for the evening prayer, they brought her little brother to the police station and sat him down in the corner."
3702,interrogation,"seeing his well-worn, faded fc barcelona t-shirt in the interrogation room made her feel faint."
3703,officers,"when the officers demanded that she look at the list again, she told them she wouldn’t do it until they took her brother home."
3704,interrogation,"the interrogation room was small and windowless, with a stained linoleum floor."
3705,sharia,ansar al-sharia?
3706,case,"daesh?” nour wondered if the officer even knew how these groups differed from one another, and if he didn’t, as seemed the case, why he was even a policeman."
3707,police,"if all the police did, apart from taking bribes, was hunt islamist militants, shouldn’t they have some basic knowledge about different factions?"
3708,wall,the girl shuffled back and forth against the wall.
3709,police,"the police hustled three more women in, with the officers demanding that nour say whether she recognized them and nour pretending not to know them at all."
3710,detention,"around 10 p.m., after a full day of interrogation, the police put nour in a van and drove her to algorjani, the detention center where terrorism suspects were handled."
3711,police,"tourism had evaporated in tunisia after the terror attacks the past year, on the beach in sousse and a museum in tunis, giving the police ample reason to pursue extremists."
3712,abuse,"the tunisian police were predisposed to abuses, and then they were given a task that invited abuse: fighting terrorism on a nationwide scale."
3713,sharia,"this new holding room at al-gorjani was slightly larger, and included a random assortment of women: a teenager, a wife of an ansar al-sharia member, and a woman who explained in bewilderment, “all they found was photos of bin laden on my phone, that’s all.” they all sat on the floor, legs outstretched; two of the women were pregnant, and kept moving wincingly from one position to another."
3714,state,the questions were the same too: “are you with isis?” “do you prefer al-qaeda?” “do you believe in the nation-state?” “what sheikh do you follow?” nour wanted to stay completely silent.
3715,police,"but she was afraid they would beat her, so she spoke only to deny everything, and it always ended up the same way too: “stupid takfiri bitch, you’d have us all killed!” the police varied their routine, trying to come up with new ways to scare her into talking."
3716,detainee,"one day they brought a young man into the room, a detainee, and punched and pummeled him until he crumpled to the floor, covering his face with his hands."
3717,officers,two officers kicked him until one eye caved in and blood was everywhere.
3718,wall,"as he grabbed his eye and turned away, he left a bloody handprint on the wall."
3719,cell,"nour slept on the soiled mattress on the floor, breathing the stench from the toilet in the cell, with an arm flung over her eyes to blunt the fluorescent light that blazed on, day and night."
3720,cell,"that morning at dawn, a prison guard had stopped her and the other women in the cell from praying together."
3721,detention,"the room where the new interrogator took her was in a different part of the detention center, a wing that was cleaner, with proper offices and desks and computers."
3722,lawyer,"she had asked for a lawyer two days prior, and they had allowed a man sent by her father to visit her."
3723,police,"but when the lawyer asked for her file, the police said no, and when he protested, they laughed and said, “go complain to the security chief, if it bothers you.” nour lost track of how long she had been at the prison."
3724,officers,"one night, one of the officers brought a young woman into the room."
3725,arrested,"the security services often arrested activists, religious and secular alike, on drug pretenses, sometimes detaining them for as long as a year, simply for possession of marijuana."
3726,state,"he whispered to her, in the little room reserved for visitations, that if they paid the lead officer two thousand dinars and changed lawyers, nour would no longer be a takfiri terrorist charged with being a member of ansar al-sharia and al-qaeda and with aiding a member of the islamic state."
3727,police,"neither nour nor her father knew it, but the bribe the officer had asked for was modest; depending on the type of case, police usually demanded between three thousand and twenty thousand dinars in terrorism cases."
3728,inmate,"with so many women detained simply for being “in contact with jihadists,” on top of the thousands of others arrested on suspicion of actual militant activity, the police had a generous inmate pool to squeeze for cash."
3729,police,"recommending a new lawyer was a popular way of dealing with this: the new lawyer would incorporate the bribe into his “fee,” and then divide the money with the police."
3730,state,"the corrupt, extralegal way it dealt with those accused of extremism was classic to the tunisian state."
3731,detention,"three weeks into detention, nour had lost weight and had scabs on her legs from the bug bites."
3732,arrest,she had not seen her daughter since her arrest.
3733,charges,"it’s enough, now.” once her family paid the bribe and changed lawyers, the police dropped all charges against her."
3734,arrest,i want you to know i have an order to arrest you right here in this car.
3735,where,"—khaled khalifa, no knives in the kitchens of this city the final time i met nour was at a café near avenue bourguiba, nearby where she works in a shoe shop."
3736,jail,"it is early 2017, and it has been over six months since nour’s release from jail."
3737,guilty,this reaction may be natural enough—we sympathize more readily with those who look like us—but it made me feel guilty.
3738,inside,i asked her what it felt like to look completely different on the outside than she felt on the inside.
3739,camp,"why should we?” july 2017, ain issa refugee camp, thirty miles north of raqqa it was near midnight as they set out from the refugee camp, ayesha with her three children, the dour turkess with her two, with ayesha feigning a broken foot that was, at moments, remarkably easy to walk on."
3740,camp,"they bribed the driver with cash they had managed to keep when they fled raqqa, and which they supplemented by selling the diapers the kurds had given them in the refugee camp."
3741,camp,"she had flirted, bribed, and wheedled her way into the graces of enough men at the refugee camp to slip out without anyone raising the alarm."
3742,taken,not that there was any functional hospital to be taken to.
3743,assault,"not that with the final assault against  raqqa unfolding just thirty miles south, an isis baby with a swollen belly was anyone’s priority."
3744,camp,"ayesha was just starting to relax, feeling satisfied with her resourcefulness—she was so unlike the other women, passively content to be corralled up at the refugee camp awaiting their fate—when they arrived at the fourth checkpoint."
3745,camp,"within an hour, they were back at the camp, and ayesha, the turkess, and their children filed back into their quarters."
3746,camp,"at the center of the camp there is a market, heaps of used clothes and shoes laid out on tarps, refugees combing through them as much for something to do as for need of an extra faded t-shirt."
3747,stretch,"they are setting up outposts across this northeastern stretch of syria called rojava, land that is administered by the syrian kurds, outside the reach of the regime."
3748,war,"no one knows how long these bases will stay—whether the united states is just helping prosecute the final phases of the ground war against isis and interrogating captured fighters, or whether it intends to stay and permanently occupy this part of syria."
3749,court,"this is not iraq in 2003, when american officials flaunted their administrative occupation of baghdad and held court in the green zone, wearing crisp khakis, dreaming up anti-smoking campaigns for iraqis over cocktails and pork hot dogs flown in by halliburton, only belatedly realizing there were problems when sunni insurgents began planting roadside bombs under their military convoys."
3750,camp,"the camp has only one permanent structure: a low-slung, four-room cement shelter."
3751,camp,"in the eyes of the camp’s seven thousand tent-housed inhabitants—mostly civilians from the eastern district of raqqa, streaming up as kurdish fighters clear isis from the city—the shelter is a luxury hotel."
3752,where,"it is here where the isis women reside with their children, in comfort and privacy, protected from the sun, the mosquitoes, the nightly arguing of neighbors wafting through the tents."
3753,camp,"everyone in the camp has arrived after enduring weeks and months of bombardment, the eerie  permanent tinnitus of hovering drones, which can itself drive you mad."
3754,camp,"they now spend their hours dazed, lying listlessly in tents or wandering about the camp."
3755,camp,"the camp is raqqa transplanted about thirty miles north, but whether it is liberated raqqa or reoccupied raqqa, no one quite knows."
3756,state,"the refugees believe they have escaped the islamic state, and women are now dressing as they used to, in long sleeves, long skirts, and headscarves."
3757,camp,"but then the isis women appear in their black niqabs, just as they wore them on the streets of raqqa, wraiths floating through the camp, stark against the chalk-white earth."
3758,power,"they hear from the adults that they are safe, that the black-robed women no longer have any power over them."
3759,where,"in the guarded compound where the isis women stay, the kurdish soldiers run what might be called a deradicalization program or an indoctrination program, depending on your perspective."
3760,question,whether these isis women are civilian wives or female jihadists in their own right is a question no one feels ready to answer.
3761,detained,"commander salar is a senior member of the syrian democratic force, charged with the security of ain issa refugee camp and the isis women detained there."
3762,war,he was well positioned to know the difference between these women and women actively involved in war.
3763,war,"salar grew up in syria among kurdish families who split down political lines as the civil war unfolded: daughters who joined the pkk, sons who went to isis out of despair at the kurds’ “failing national project.” there are many paths to militancy, he has seen, that aren’t about militancy per se."
3764,repression,"often the militancy is a reaction to repression and broken aspirations and false hopes, a disavowal of circumstances that feel unbearable."
3765,detention,"his job is to offer the most humane, international-norm-abiding detention possible in the middle of this desert heat, in order to further the kurds’ dreams of retaining this patch of syria as an independent statelet."
3766,stretch,"kurdish fighters have kept the assad regime out of this large eastern stretch of syria for years now—it is a de facto, temporary autonomy that makes genuine autonomy feel tantalizingly within reach."
3767,taken,"some of the isis women have taken wildly circuitous routes to arrive here, hoping to avoid falling into the hands of the iraqi forces battling isis to the south, inside iraq."
3768,state,"now that al-baghdadi’s aspirant state is crumbling, it is expedient, indeed a matter of survival, for its fleeing ruler-inhabitants to declare to have never believed in it."
3769,detained,"nearly all of the isis women detained in this camp claim to be victims, dissenters at heart who were forced to stay in islamic state territory because getting out was impossible."
3770,roads,they cite happenstance and conniving husbands and bad roads for how they ended up with isis.
3771,state,"they admit they were originally true believers in the state-building project, but maintain that they quickly lost faith when they saw it was a miserable, vicious lie."
3772,camp,the civilians in the camp don’t buy it for a second.
3773,officers,neither do some of the officers and staff who are tasked with looking after them.
3774,state,"if the courtyard of the women is a microcosm of the islamic state in exile, then the wider camp is the future of syria, teeming with questions of complicity and regret, everyone competing for a share of victimhood."
3775,camp,"— ayesha, the woman who failed to escape the camp, glides around with the air of a beleaguered exiled  aristocrat—as though she were a white russian washed up in paris, a post-shah persian in kensington— keen to establish that her current status doesn’t reflect her proper station in life."
3776,taken,"the direct northern route she would normally have taken, she says, was blocked because of the fighting, and she had to travel circuitously east across the country, to approach the turkish border north of raqqa."
3777,police,"“and in the morning the isis police came to the house, and told me it is forbidden to live in the land of unbelief,” she says."
3778,killing,"he asked them, ‘where’s your father?’ and they said, ‘we have no father!’ ” the man next door was moroccan, a gold trader from the medina of tangiers, who was “persuaded by facebook friends” that assad was killing muslim women, that he should come to their aid and join the fight; that he could practice his islam freely in syria."
3779,where,“where is this assad that i came to fight?” she recounts him saying.
3780,where,"we both kept saying to each other, ‘i wish i had met you earlier!’ ” ayesha seems aware that parts of her story sound implausible, and she moves briskly on to other topics where she sounds more persuasive: “isis was really preying on young europeans’ vulnerabilities, the ones who already had problems with their families."
3781,camp,"they were very clever to prey on the europeans like this.” she mentions that a journalist who works for a dubai-based television network recently visited the camp, and wonders what has been said about her and the other women."
3782,where,"not even fresh vegetables.” as her kids surround her in the concrete room where we are talking, they appear conspicuously cleaner than some of the other isis women’s children."
3783,camp,"“they sell them for money at the kiosks.” the camp is starting to receive visits from international aid groups, military intelligence officials, and journalists."
3784,camp,"when the company of the isis women grows unbearable, she calls on hoda, a nineteen-year-old indonesian, who, along with the rest of her twenty-twomember family, lives in a capacious tent at the head of the camp."
3785,state,"she chronicled her experiences on her blog, detailing the free health care, education, jobs, and largesse that were on offer in the islamic state, calling on fellow muslims to join her."
3786,state,she told them about a place in syria where devoted muslims were building an islamic state.
3787,slavery,"the beheading of the aid worker alan henning, and the reports of yazidi women being forced into sex slavery?"
3788,state,"“do you know what it’s like when you love the idea of something so much you’re willing to overlook the bad in it?” the truth that lurks behind her sentences is that if the islamic state had actually formed a proper state, if it had upheld its obligations, behaved justly, and provided its citizens with security and livelihoods, the violence might have been forgiven—regarded as a means to an end, the brutality required to achieve independence."
3789,state,"getting anything out of the islamic state, she soon found,  was like trying to cajole a drug cartel into following the rule of law."
3790,state,"they said to us, ‘what have you done for the state?"
3791,state,"what have you done for islam, that we should support you?’ ” hoda spent her days writing argumentative emails to the islamic state authorities, laying out why her family’s demands were legitimate."
3792,state,"they lived in a state of permanent fear, and the isis municipality also charged them three times more for electricity."
3793,sentence,"they would say, ‘he’s from this or that place.’ one sentence!"
3794,detention,"the others spent three months in detention while hoda worked the internet, trying to get help."
3795,camp,"at one of the cisterns in the center of the camp, people stop to chat under a sky that is starting to blush at the horizon; more people slowly come out of their tents to talk and stroll in the precious two-hour stretch of time, before and after sunset, when the heat gradually softens and the mosquitoes do not yet prey."
3796,camp,"when i ask if nahla thinks any of the isis women in the camp might have also suffered at the hands of men, men rabid enough to execute mechanics for minor impudence, nahla narrows her eyes and laughs."
3797,crime,“have you ever heard of a criminal admitting his crime?
3798,camp,around two hundred new people arrive at the camp every day.
3799,stretch,he has walked the thirty-mile stretch from raqqa.
3800,building,"— as ayesha and the turkess are mounting their escape, commander salar retreats to the two-story,  gutted-out municipal building in ain issa where he and his soldiers sleep."
3801,situation,the isis women’s situation preys on salar’s mind.
3802,camp,their presence in the camp is disruptive and precarious.
3803,due process,to afford them due process is costly and timeconsuming; evidence is often inadmissible or hard to come by.
3804,sentences,"this makes it difficult to prosecute every isis woman or fighter who has committed atrocities, and the risk is that courts will have to allow many to go free or to impose light sentences."
3805,coercion,but equally there is no mechanism to account for the violence and coercion many members endured themselves at the hands of the group.
3806,state,"how to sieve out the regretters and the dissenters, those who were appalled at what they found in the islamic state and tried to escape but could not?"
3807,criminal,"most western countries have been content to make their isis citizens the problems of others— the syrian kurds, the iraqi kurds, the iraqi criminal justice system."
3808,war,"to inflict this on fragile countries already deeply securitized and struggling to recover from years of war is immoral; it also runs the risk of allowing isis members, men and women alike, to receive vengeance-as-justice or perhaps even worse, no justice at all."
3809,war,"states like britain, france, and the united states passed on “kill lists” early in the war to the iraqi military."
3810,case,"a british official said openly that “unfortunately, the only way of dealing with them will be, in almost every case, to kill them.” “it’s too difficult to take them back,” i say to commander salar."
3811,camp,"i would take them.” — one of the only isis women at ease in the camp is khadija omri, twenty-nine, a sturdy and olive-  skinned tunisian."
3812,camp,"she understands that the civilians in the camp see her as a blight, and that she has the first thirty seconds of each encounter to conquer that."
3813,situation,“how come your situation is like this?
3814,state,"he gave up on any prospect of a future in tunisia and decided it was his duty to fight for god in syria, to lend a hand to the brothers trying to establish a state."
3815,locked,"if a widow offended her, she would ban her from the common rooms in the house, and keep her locked up in a small room with her children the whole day."
3816,state,"“by then, i hated the state,” khadija says."
3817,executed,"in their circle of tunisians, many men had been executed for refusing to fight or trying to escape."
3818,where,"some tunisians tried to move to the distant countryside, where isis had little or no presence."
3819,gang,"in the end, they moved to mayadin, one of isis’s most important strongholds near the iraqi border, and abdi joined a gang of fighters trying to raise money to escape by stealing isis cars and selling them in nearby rural towns."
3820,taken,the friend explained that the yazidi girl had recently given birth and that her isis captor had taken the baby away and given it to his infertile wife.
3821,where,"it was a house where fighters visited kept women, because they were tired of polygamy and squabbling cowives, tired of the whatsapp groups with pictures of yazidi girls for sale, tired of having to bear responsibility for a woman through formal possession and subjugation."
3822,state,“i lived under the islamic state for four years.
3823,power,"all they cared about was women, pleasure, money, and power."
3824,where,"if he does, why doesn’t he show his face?” there are kurdish soldiers continuously passing through the cement room where khadija sits, recounting these stories."
3825,state,"but it was not easy, leaving the state."
3826,arrested,"soon after they reached the border, they were arrested by american and kurdish soldiers."
3827,rape,“how come he did not rape me?
3828,camp,khadija likes walking near the kiosks and talking to other women in the camp.
3829,camp,"life in the camp would be easier if she stopped wearing her black robes, but she clings to them, defensive about their meaning."
3830,state,"these strikes are conducted by a command center 1,200 miles away in the persian gulf state of qatar, based on scant seconds of observation and often outdated intelligence."
3831,death,"journalists who visit sites of coalition strikes in iraq find that one in five result in civilian death, a rate thirty-one times that acknowledged by the coalition."
3832,death,"in raqqa, the u.s. military operates on the belief that raqqa is no city for civilians anyway; that to be in raqqa is to have asked for death."
3833,camp,"at the ain issa refugee camp, the night is sometimes quiet, sometimes punctured with the sound of aircraft."
3834,camp,"they are soaring toward raqqa city, just thirty miles south of the camp, where we sit outside under the dark night sky frantic with stars."
3835,camp,could they not have slipped in among the women who made it to this camp?
3836,detention,"commander salar says her father-in-law is an important senior isis figure and that during the first few days of her detention, hajar threatened his men with torture and beheading, were they to harm her."
3837,camp,"she does not know that mahmoud is from ain issa itself, the town that houses the camp."
3838,where,"she left them with a neighbor to go collect her husband’s isis salary in raqqa, and then she was captured by kurdish fighters en route back to mayadin, where they were living."
3839,suspect,"she is really asking, if kurdish soldiers killed my isis fighter husband, as i suspect, would they then have thrown him into a ditch or set him on fire, or wrapped him in a shroud and given him an islamic burial?"
3840,question,mahmoud recoils at this question.
3841,punishment,"last week they burned an imam to death in front of his mosque.” he is really saying, how dare you impute such a punishment to us?"
3842,detainees,"he was taken by them.” “no, they don’t kill detainees."
3843,where,"they take the injured to hospitals.” “i asked one of the commanders,” she says, nodding her head toward the outpost where the kurdish soldiers sit."
3844,where,"“he told me, ‘your husband is in hell.’ ” “we don’t know where he is.” “i need to know if he is alive or not."
3845,court,will there be a court hearing for the women?” hajar.
3846,war,"not some sincere but insufficiently skeptical believer who thought a kingdom of heaven, forged in the middle of bloody war, would save her husband or family from debt and joblessness."
3847,power,"but even hajar has a story, and it is the story of syria itself: the authoritarian rule of the assad dynasty, and the lengths it has always been willing to go—massacres, oppression, and bloodshed—to retain absolute power."
3848,where,"there was a cemetery not far from the playground near her house, where many of those killed in the uprising were buried."
3849,war,"the syrian civil war, now drawing to a close, is most often viewed as a sectarian war between shia and sunnis, a proxy conflict between iran and gulf arab states, and a contest for the upper-hand among those arab states themselves."
3850,war,"those who wish to excuse america’s role in exacerbating the conflict call it a war of iranian aggression, abetted by russia; those who wish to challenge u.s. hegemony minimize assad’s war crimes and paint his opposition as al-qaeda fanatics."
3851,camp,"—  it was in al hol, on the western flank of syria, about two hundred and fifty kilometers west of ain issa, in  that fetid, freezing camp brimming with people, that shamima begum surfaced again, in the eyes of the world."
3852,war,"her young daughter and son were  sick, but it was difficult to be seen by a doctor; the hospitals in the areas where they were staying, around mayadin and hajin, were overwhelmed by people with war injuries."
3853,state,"she joined the crowds moving away from the fighting, streaming toward the territory held by the militias fighting the latest dredges of the islamic state."
3854,camp,"her daughter, increasingly ill, died before they reached the camp at al hol, where isis families and civilians who had fled were sheltering."
3855,state,"— the fact that she had been groomed and recruited as a fifteen-year-old, primed and indoctrinated by  the islamic state, evaporated from the national conversation about her."
3856,authorities,"would she accept it if the british authorities took her child away, in the event they were admitted back to the uk?"
3857,where,"“i think a lot of people should have, like, sympathy towards me for everything i’ve been through.” — but sympathy was not where public sentiment was headed."
3858,ordered,"short days after shamima surfaced and  asked for help to be brought home, the uk home secretary ordered her to be stripped of british citizenship."
3859,camp,"she named him jarrah, and posed for a photographer,  standing in the camp with a sea of white tents in the background, holding the infant in a blue-and-whitestriped blanket."
3860,camp,"— outside, near the kiosks that sell tea where people gather to smoke or chat as the sky darkens, there  are tales traded about the outlandish stories circulating in the camp, stories that fleeing isis members will tell as they try to hide what they have done: there is the man who says he came to the caliphate as a simit seller and stayed to write short stories; there is a sudden profusion of cooks and clerical assistants."
3861,detained,"all through 2017 and into 2019, camps in syria and iraq swelled with thousands of isis women and children, whose husbands and fathers were either dead or detained by iraqi or u.s.-allied kurdish forces."
3862,sentencing,courts in baghdad began sentencing many of the foreign women to death.
3863,state,"the office of the un high commissioner for human rights warned these trials would lead to “irreversible miscarriages of justice,” but for the iraqi state, the summary trials were retribution for the extreme savagery isis and its predecessors had shown toward shia iraqis."
3864,authorities,"the judicial authorities were also pragmatic: if most of these women’s countries of origin refused to take them back, what was to be done?"
3865,death,what if they still believed that everyone who wasn’t affiliated with isis was an enemy of god who deserved death?
3866,state,"the uk home office argued this was “in the public good” and that citizenship was “a privilege, not a right,” even as it rendered these individuals stateless, leaving them without the recourse or oversight of any state’s legal process or rules."
3867,war,"after 9/11, in the netherworld of the war on terror, western security states set down a dark path; they began rejecting the very idea that war had rules, that prisoners were still humans with rights."
3868,war,"america’s war on terror had created an enduring, transnational third dimension, a lethal space of limbo, untethered from the rules-based international order, in which suspects were passed around, held indefinitely, tortured, and executed."
3869,state,— the islamic state was now vanquished as a military force.
3870,state,"the leaders of countries whose citizens had flocked to join the islamic state, from morocco to saudi arabia, pretended to recognize the need for changing the conditions that had propelled their young women and men to “syria’s field of jihads.” but virtually many of their failed policies remained in place."
3871,where,"in tunisia, where nour was raising her daughter alone in a country where she had been unable to get an education because of her faith, there was at least a glimmer of change."
3872,police,"the economy still kept her family at borderline poverty, most encounters with the police still ended with a bribe, and her brand of salafi activism was banned."
3873,detention,"rahma, speaking to journalists from her detention in libya, made it clear she felt the same way."
3874,state,"but to a great many tunisians, their fumbling, more inclusive government—the only state in the whole of the region where the pre–arab spring opposition was still in the political game, and the old elites had met some semblance of justice—was something to value."
3875,where,"the new tunisia faced powerful regional foes, particularly saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, who chafed at seeing a country where moderate islamists had prevailed."
3876,where,nour’s daughter would grow up in a country where such things were possible.
3877,war,"for asma and aws, who once had promising futures as educated women, poised to achieve more independence than any generation of syrian women before them, the war had blighted any such prospects."
3878,killing,"dua, who had only ever wanted a simple life of dignity, was stranded in a foreign country, with no skills or education, separated from her family, alone with the memory that her saudi husband had died killing other muslims."
3879,repression,"in government-controlled syria, the broken land over which bashar al-assad presided as nominal victor, there was no sign that the regime would cease the policies of repression and violence that had provoked the original uprising."
3880,detention,"in july 2018, the government issued death certificates for sixty thousand people who had simply disappeared in government detention."
3881,war,"those who remained in syria, on both sides of the regime/opposition divide, found themselves corrupted and straining for basic subsistence amid the lawlessness and insecurity of seven years of war."
3882,death,"reopening a shop, procuring a death certificate, requesting information about disappeared relatives: every small act required exorbitant payments to either local militias, predatory lawyers, or bureaucrats."
3883,war,"the war had decimated much of the country’s male population; millions had fled, and of those who had stayed, a great many had been maimed or killed."
3884,racism,"the far right were ascendant, the right wing of angela merkel’s party agitated for the upper hand, and the everyday racism and exclusion she had seen muslimborn germans endure in her youth were only exacerbated by the influx of syrian refugees."
3885,injustice,"whether the next generation of muslims in germany took a similar path, if they felt global injustice acutely enough to be led down the dark hole of militancy, only god could know."
3886,assault,"the u.s. military, for its part, refused to count the civilians it had killed in the blitz-style final assault against isis."
3887,war,"had such terms been achievable, the war would likely not have dragged on for seven years, defying any resolution in the first place."
3888,exercise,"some collaborated or acted knowingly; some were so young that, despite the outward appearance of deliberate choice, they were not mature enough to exercise anything approaching adult judgment."
3889,war,"this is largely because the counterterrorism discourses, from the united nations and across national governments, seek to discuss and craft policies targeting women across a vast range of political and social contexts—from the hipster neighborhoods of peaceful east london to the collapsed, war-torn cities of syria and iraq to the battlefields of somalia and nigeria, where unpopular, weak, or corrupt states confront armed and popular opponents."
3890,repression,"doctors in the nineteenth century believed women “hysterics” were possessed by demons and deviant sexual desires; in the twenty-first century, professional “deradicalizers” believe women militants are consumed by wicked religious ideologies and sexual repression."
3891,power,"the comparison is useful mainly for the sake of identifying the power of the diagnostician in relation to the subject: hysteria was a made-up disease, constructed by medical forces in a culture that prized female docility and purity."
3892,repression,"but it is more politically expedient to suggest that women have been bewitched than to acknowledge the overarching wars, conflicts, and authoritarian repression that have created the grievances and space for extremism to thrive."
3893,where,"progressive analysis certainly helps us see how women distinctly experience repressive political orders, where they are marginalized and disempowered by their social status, religious sect, political affiliation, or identity mosaics of all these things."
3894,punitive,"they will at best fail and waste resources, and at worst may aggravate conditions by imposing punitive and wrong-minded solutions."
3895,case,"i hope, after having spent time in the lives of these women, you will understand instinctively why this is the case."
3896,state,"there is a shortage of accounts that consider how ordinary women in the middle east are drawn to militancy as a last resort—after having sought peaceful, civic, alternative ways to negotiate themselves out of circumstances of poverty, instability, lawlessness, discrimination, corruption, state repression, and abuse."
3897,state,"women may certainly experience wars, volatility, and state repression differently than men."
3898,building,"a sour, salty smell wafts up from the sheep’s brain-and-tripe restaurant on the ground floor of the building."
3899,where,"it was partly why the three of them thought constantly about leaving this world of syrian refugees behind, to try to slip into some european city where they could start over again."
3900,war,it is said that war transforms women’s status in a society faster than any other sort of change.
3901,sharia,"she is still stunned that many in her community, the boys she had grown up with, had wanted a future like that, so inward-turning and orthodox, an islam of sharia and little more."
3902,industrial,"what strong, bright current could really have emerged from a murky sinister rule like that of the assads, distinct and untouched by the industrial-scale brutality, ready to take a different course?"
3903,power,"there was no faction in the syrian conflict that had ennobled itself, that hadn’t descended into a raw craving for power and had refrained from hurting others."
3904,war,"that community that had existed before the war, so humdrum in its habits, but in hindsight so innocent, was destroyed now, and irretrievable."
3905,war,"people carried war wounds into their old age, handed memories and enmities down from generation to generation."
3906,awaiting,"i’m not talking just about isis, but among everyone.” in the european cities that beckon in the distance, promising some better days on this earth, there remains an enduring fear of precisely this: that women like asma, aws, and dua, as well as men who carried guns in syria, would arrive as refugees and walk the streets, awaiting residency."
3907,state,this residual fear is all that lingered of the islamic state caliphate in the eyes of those who had never longed for one.
3908,state,"to live as perpetual others within the west, within it but never of it, part of it; increasingly reviled; marked as different by their religion, even if that religion was only one thread of their identities; disconnected from any power; obliged to watch one middle eastern state fall after another."
3909,where,"where possible, i consulted as many sources as possible surrounding these stories and events as well as alternative perspectives, in an attempt to verify the truthfulness of the accounts."
3910,where,"in sections where i portray a wider social and political context in significant detail, i spent months and years, in some cases, reporting the background story myself."
3911,establishment,"in london, i spent years investigating and writing about the complex backstory to the bethnal green girls’ disappearance, which is foregrounded by the evolution of the british muslim community itself and its increasingly tense relationship with a political and media establishment sympathetic and tilting to the far right."
3912,question,the question may arise as to whether my iranian background might have complicated my research.
3913,war,"i am acutely aware that these stories do not tell the comprehensive story of all isis women, and that many engaged in atrocities that amounted to war crimes."
3914,suspects,"ethical considerations matter, even with isis suspects."
3915,detention,"i will state openly, and wish more colleagues would do the same, that women associated with isis being held by kurdish or iraqi security forces consent  to interviews in the context of civilian detention, but detention nonetheless."
3916,abuse,"the things they say, whether truthful, false, or simply coerced, may put them at risk of abuse."
3917,abuse,"journalists dart back to the safety of western capitals, their front-page stories or podcast material in hand, rarely thinking about the fate of the female sources they leave behind, whether they are now more vulnerable to abuse or wrongful prosecution because of things they have said, their identities almost never protected."
3918,detention,"i elected not to include the experience of at least one interviewee in the narrative, because i felt the conditions of her detention were too securitized to consider her nominal consent freely given."
3919,war,"i relied on a number of publications by academics, journalists, and researchers in the course of my writing, including work by nadia marzouki, hamza meddeb, fabio marone, rory mccarthy, youssef cherif, habib sayah, darryl li, thomas hegghammer, shadi hamid, max weiss, stéphane lacroix, shiraz maher, joas wagemakers, guido steinberg, madawi al-rasheed, michael ayari, sam heller, and richard atwood, as well as the following books: arun kundnani, the muslims are coming: islamophobia, extremism, and the domestic war on terror; lisa wedeen, ambiguities of domination: politics, rhetoric, and symbols in contemporary syria; hanna batatu, syria’s peasantry, the descendants of its lesser rural notables, and their politics; lisa stampnitzky, disciplining terror: how experts invented “terrorism”; mohammad abu rumman, hasssan abu hanieh, infatuated with martyrdom: female jihadism from al-qaeda to the “islamic state”; mohammad-mahmoud ould mohamedou, a theory of isis: political violence and the transformation of global order, global salafism: islam’s new religious movement, edited by roel meijer; rania abouzeid, no turning back: life, loss, and hope in wartime syria."
3920,state,"i am grateful to the support of the new america fellows program, as well as to arizona state university: awista ayoub, peter bergen, and daniel rothman."
3921,wall,"when we had deprived the house of all its items, when the objects had vanished and the colors had faded into eight gray suitcases, like errant genies evaporating into their bottles, my students and i stood against the bare white wall of the dining room and took two photographs."
3922,wall,"in the first there are seven women, standing against a white wall."
3923,law,"they are, according to the law of the land, dressed in black robes and head scarves, covered except for the oval of their faces and their hands."
3924,wall,"in the second photograph the same group, in the same position, stands against the same wall."
3925,taken,only they have taken off their coverings.
3926,building,"in one, i am standing with eight of my students in the small garden facing our faculty building, the scene of so many farewell photographs over the years."
3927,criminal,"but to steal the words from humbert, the poet/criminal of lolita, i need you, the reader, to imagine us, for we won't really exist if you don't."
3928,taken,"and then imagine us again with all this confiscated, driven underground, taken away from us."
3929,wall,"my mother would go crazy each time she saw the paintings leaning against the wall and the vases of flowers on the floor and the curtainless windows, which i refused to dress until i was finally reminded that this was an islamic country and windows needed to be dressed."
3930,wall,"there was a love seat against one wall, over which i had thrown a lace cover, my mother's gift from long ago."
3931,war,"opposite the window was the former american hospital, once small and exclusive, now a noisy, overcrowded medical facility for wounded and disabled veterans of the war."
3932,exercise,"sometimes a child or two would ring our doorbell and run away, repeating their perilous exercise at intervals."
3933,wall,"i could not see my favorite mountains from where i sat, but opposite my chair, on the far wall of the dining room, was an antique oval mirror, a gift from my father, and in its reflection, i could see the mountains capped with snow, even in summer, and watch the trees change color."
3934,where,"the university of allameh tabatabai, where i had been teaching since 1987, had been singled out as the most liberal university in iran."
3935,question,i had asked myself this question many times.
3936,where,where will you go from here?
3937,pleaded,"please, please, i pleaded with myself, putting on my shoes and going into the kitchen."
3938,where,"she wore the scarf even before the revolution, and in her class diary, she wrote about the lonely mornings when she went to a fashionable girls' college, where she felt neglected and ignored-ironically, because of her then-conspicuous attire."
3939,jail,"after the revolution, she was jailed for five years because of her affiliation with a dissident religious organization and banned from continuing her education for two years after she was out of jail."
3940,jail,i cannot imagine her in jail.
3941,jail,"over the many years i have known mahshid, she has rarely alluded to her jail experiences, which left her with a permanently impaired kidney."
3942,jail,"one day in class, as we were talking about our daily terrors and nightmares, she mentioned that her jail memories visited her from time to time and that she had still not found a way to articulate them."
3943,wall,"then one day when we had guests and i was eating my soup in the dining room, my eyes fell on a painting i had seen on the wall ever since i could remember, and i instantly knew the color of my paradise."
3944,imprisoned,"she had a small, pale face, skin so transparent you could count the veins, full eyebrows, long lashes, lively eyes (brown), a small straight nose and an angry mouth: an unfinished miniature by some master who had suddenly been called away from his job and left the meticulously drawn face imprisoned in a careless splash of dark color."
3945,thief,"she looked harassed, as if she had been running from a stalker or a thief."
3946,taken,"he had taken to proving his masculinity by spying on her, listening to her phone conversations, driving her car around and monitoring her actions."
3947,where,"they wrote to each other, sent photographs, and recently, when the number of sanaz's suitors increased, there were talks of engagement and a reunion in turkey, where iranians did not require entrance visas."
3948,possession,"she shook her magnificent hair from side to side, a gesture that i later noticed was a habit with her; she would toss her head and run her fingers through her hair every once in a while, as if making sure that her most prized possession was still there."
3949,where,"he never gets up before ten, but he wanted to know where i was going."
3950,case,"reading lolita in tehran  i have been worrying in case any of you would get into trouble for this class, i said, inviting them all to take their seats around the table in the living room."
3951,illegal,we tell them we don't have illegal books and alcohol in our houses.
3952,where,"i had settled into my usual chair, opposite the mirror, where the mountains had come to stay."
3953,taken,"mahshid, after some hesitation, had taken the chair to my right."
3954,power,"i mentioned that one of the criteria for the books i had chosen was their authors' faith in the critical and almost magical power of literature, and reminded them of the nineteen-year-old nabokov, who, during the russian revolution, would not allow himself to be diverted by the sound of bullets."
3955,situation,"i formulated certain general questions for them to consider, the most central of which was how these great works of imagination could help us in our present trapped situation as women."
3956,death,"they do not quite exist, because they leave no trace in their anonymous death."
3957,authority,the queen's infidelity does not rob the king of his absolute authority; it throws him off balance.
3958,authority,both types of women-the queen and the virgins-tacitly accept the king's public authority by acting within the confines of his domain and by accepting its arbitrary laws.
3959,serving,"brewing and serving tea is an aesthetic ritual in iran, performed several times a day."
3960,law,"in this novel, nabokov differentiates cincinnatus c., his imaginative and lonely hero, from those around him through his originality in a society where uniformity is not only the norm but also the law."
3961,term,"except for four or five students, no one had any idea what i could possibly mean, a point i did not forget to remind them of every once in a while throughout the rest of that term."
3962,sentence,"i proposed that for the next time, they each write a sentence or two explaining what the word meant to them."
3963,crime,"invitation to a beheading begins with the announcement that its fragile hero, cincinnatus c., has been sentenced to death for the crime of ""gnostic turpitude"": in a place where all citizens are required to be transparent, he is opaque."
3964,execution,"the principal characteristic of this world is its arbitrariness; the condemned man's only privilege is to know the time of his death-but the executioners keep even this from him, turning every day into a day of execution."
3965,prisoner,"the moon from the window is fake; so is the spider in the corner, which, according to convention, must become the prisoner's faithful companion."
3966,jail,"the director of the jail, the jailer and the defense lawyer are all the same man, and keep changing places."
3967,prisoner,"the most important character, the executioner, is first introduced to the prisoner under another name and as a fellow prisoner: m'sieur pierre."
3968,execution,"the executioner and the condemned man must learn to love each other and cooperate in the act of execution, which will be celebrated in a gaudy feast."
3969,death,"every act is bereft of substance and significance, and even death becomes a spectacle for which the good citizens buy tickets."
3970,term,nabokov had a special russian term for this: poshlust.
3971,torture,what nabokov creates for us in invitation to a beheading is not the actual physical pain and torture of a totalitarian regime but the nightmarish quality of living in an atmosphere of perpetual dread.
3972,where,"what nabokov captured was the texture of life in a totalitarian society, where you are completely alone in an illusory world full of false promises, where you can no longer differentiate between your savior and your executioner."
3973,taken,"there was something, both in his fiction and in his life, that we instinctively related to and grasped, the possibility of a boundless freedom when all options are taken away."
3974,state,"both embody the ""fragile unreality""-to quote nabokov on his own state of exile-of our existence in the islamic republic of iran."
3975,inside,the second photograph belonged to the world inside the living room.
3976,where,"but outside, underneath the window that deceptively showcased only the mountains and the tree outside our house, was the other world, where the bad witches and furies were waiting to transform us into the hooded creatures of the first."
3977,where,"not just our reality but also our fiction had taken on this curious coloration in a world where the censor was the poet's rival in rearranging and reshaping reality, where we simultaneously invented ourselves and were figments of someone else's imagination."
3978,where,"this was a country where all gestures, even the most private, were interpreted in political terms."
3979,state,"there, in that living room, we rediscovered that we were also living, breathing human beings; and no matter how repressive the state became, no matter how intimidated and frightened we were, like lolita we tried to escape and to create our own little pockets of freedom."
3980,guard,"my sister, guard your veil."
3981,guard,"my brother, guard your eyes."
3982,where,"yet in taxis, which accept as many as five passengers, men and women are squeezed together like sardines, as the saying goes, and the same goes with minibuses, where so many of my students complain of being harassed by bearded and godfearing men."
3983,situation,does she compare her own situation with her mother's when she was the same age?
3984,police,"is she angry that women of her mother's generation could walk the streets freely, enjoy the company of the opposite sex, join the police force, become pilots, live under laws that were among the most progressive in the world regarding women?"
3985,punishment,"does she feel humiliated by the new laws, by the fact that after the revolution, the age of marriage was lowered from eighteen to nine, that stoning became once more the punishment for adultery and prostitution?"
3986,jail,"in the course of nearly two decades, the streets have been turned into a war zone, where young women who disobey the rules are hurled into patrol cars, taken to jail, flogged, fined, forced to wash the toilets and humiliated, and as soon as they leave, they go back and do the same thing."
3987,power,"is she aware, sanaz, of her own power?"
3988,where,"we have reached sanaz's house, where we will leave her on her doorstep, perhaps to confront her brother on the other side and to think in her heart of her boyfriend."
3989,taken,"9 it is amazing how, when all possibilities seem to be taken away from you, the minutest opening can become a great freedom."
3990,gate,"about a month after i had decided privately to leave allameh tabatabai, yassi and i were standing in front of the green gate at the entrance of the university."
3991,gate,what i remember most distinctly about the university now is that green gate.
3992,gate,"in my memory the iron gate acquires an elastic quality and becomes a magic door, unsupported by walls, guarding the university grounds."
3993,gate,i owe my memory of the green gate to yassi: she mentioned it in one of her poems.
3994,gate,"in it, she describes her favorite objects-an orange backpack, a colorful coat, a bicycle just like her cousin's-and she also describes how much she likes to enter the university through the green gate."
3995,gate,"the gate appears in this poem, and in some of her other writings, as a magical entrance into the forbidden world of all the ordinary things she had been denied in life."
3996,gate,"yet that green gate was closed to her, and to all my girls."
3997,gate,next to the gate there was a small opening with a curtain hanging from it.
3998,authority,"it was an aberration that attracted attention, because it did not belong there: it gaped with the arrogant authority of an intruder."
3999,gate,"imagine yassi standing with me in front of that green gate, laughing between conspiratorial  reading lolita in tehran  whispers, our bodies close together."
4000,death,"three months after his wife's death, he had married her younger sister, because a man-and here yassi lowered her voicea man has his special needs."
4001,power,her power came from her modesty.
4002,where,"i cannot see that laughter in most of her photographs, where she stands at some distance from the others, as if indicating that she, as the junior member of our class, knows her place."
4003,where,"we went to a small shop, where, sitting opposite each other with two tall cafés glacés in between us, our mood changed."
4004,jailed,"they were all but one arrested, tortured and jailed."
4005,jail,yassi felt that they had survived the jail but could not escape the bonds of traditional marriage.
4006,taken,"as a teenager she had defied family traditions and, in the face of strong opposition, had taken up music."
4007,where,"in one sense it was more limited than her home, where she was blessed with a loving and intellectual environment."
4008,guilty,"she missed her parents and family, and she felt guilty for the pain she had inflicted on them."
4009,guilt,"later, i discovered that her guilt caused her long hours of disabling migraine headaches."
4010,ward,i remember the movement of her hand as she said this-flitting in front of her face as if to ward off an invisible fly.
4011,rape,the desperate truth of lolita's story is not the rape of a twelve-year-old by a dirty old man but the confiscation of one individual's life by another.
4012,taken,"warming up and suddenly inspired, i added that in fact nabokov had taken revenge against our own solipsizers; he had taken revenge on the ayatollah khomeini, on yassi's last suitor, on the dough-faced teacher for that matter."
4013,power,"so he decided to stop writing, to stop making a living for as long as the communists were in power."
4014,wall,the only decoration in the living room was a large painting on the otherwise empty wall facing the entrance.
4015,sentences,"i remember one of his oft-repeated sentences: ""i want to be forgotten; i am not a member of this club."""
4016,state,"what i did not tell yassi that day was that nabokov's magician, the man who was as dangerous to the state as an armed rebel, did not exist-or, at least, not in fiction."
4017,where,"he was real and lived less than fifteen minutes away from where she and i were sitting, aimlessly stirring our long spoons in the tall glasses."
4018,death,"10 i have asked you to imagine us, to imagine us in the act of reading lolita in tehran: a novel about a man who, in order to possess and captivate a twelve-year-old girl, indirectly causes the death of her mother, charlotte, and keeps her as his little entrapped mistress for two years."
4019,camp,"let us go to the part when humbert arrives at lolita's summer camp to pick her up after her mother's death, of which she knows nothing."
4020,captivity,"this scene is the prelude to two years of captivity, during which the unwitting lolita drifts from one motel to another with her guardian-lover: ""let me retain for a moment that scene in all its trivial and fateful detail: hag holmes writing out a receipt, scratching her head, pulling a drawer out of her desk, pouring change into my impatient palm, then neatly spreading a banknote over it with a bright '."
4021,wall,"'; photographs of girlchildren; some gaudy moth or butterfly, still alive, safely pinned to the wall ('nature study'); the framed diploma of the camp's dietitian; my trembling hands; a card produced by efficient holmes with a report of dolly haze's behavior for july ('fair to good; keen on swimming and boating'); a sound of trees and birds, and my pounding heart ."
4022,guilty,"ordinary objects in this seemingly descriptive scene are destabilized by emotions, revealing humbert's guilty secret."
4023,jailer,"those who tell us lolita is a little vixen who deserved what she got should remember her nightly sobs in the arms of her rapist and jailer, because you see, as humbert reminds us with a mixture of relish and pathos, ""she had absolutely nowhere else to go."""
4024,wall,"when i think of lolita, i think of that half-alive butterfly pinned to the wall."
4025,jailer,lolita's image is forever associated in the minds of her readers with that of her jailer.
4026,jailer,and more and more i thought of that butterfly; what linked us so closely was this perverse intimacy of victim and jailer.
4027,question,"she had written, ""i am not ready for that question yet."""
4028,where,where they opened up and became excited was in our discussion of the works.
4029,hole,"there was a certain innocence with which we read these books; we read them apart from our own  reading lolita in tehran  history and expectations, like alice running after the white rabbit and jumping into the hole."
4030,question,"curiously, the novels we escaped into led us finally to question and prod our own realities, about which we felt so helplessly speechless."
4031,where,this was one domain where ideology played a relatively small part.
4032,rape,"then there are others-among them lionel trilling, no less-who see the  reading lolita in tehran  story as a great love affair, and still others who condemn lolita because they feel nabokov turned the rape of a twelve-year-old into an aesthetic experience."
4033,jail,"humbert's narration is confessional, both in the usual sense of the term and in that he is literally writing a confession in jail, awaiting trial for the murder of the playwright claire quilty, with whom lolita ran away to escape him and who cast her off after she refused to participate in his cruel sex games."
4034,crime,"as the story unfolds, a deeper crime, more serious than quilty's murder, is revealed: the entrapment and rape of lolita (you will notice that while lolita's scenes are written with passion and tenderness, quilty's murder is portrayed as farce)."
4035,taken,"humbert's prose, veering at times towards the shamelessly overwrought, aims at seducing the reader, especially the high-minded reader, who will be taken in by such erudite gymnastics."
4036,taken,"as such, she becomes a double victim: not only her life but also her life story is taken from her."
4037,crime,we told ourselves we were in that class to prevent ourselves from falling victim to this second crime.
4038,sentence,"sentence by sentence and word by word, humbert destroys charlotte even as he describes her: ""she was obviously one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or a bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul."""
4039,liberty,"what we have here is the first lesson in democracy: all individuals, no matter how contemptible, have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
4040,crime,humbert makes fullest use of his art and guile in setting the reader up for his most heinous crime: his first attempt at possessing lolita.
4041,juvenile,"[n]ot a trace of modesty,"" he confides, ""did i perceive in this beautiful badly formed young girl whom modern co-education, juvenile mores, the campfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved."
4042,criminal,"so far it would seem that humbert the criminal, with the help of humbert the poet, has succeeded in seducing both lolita and the reader."
4043,rape,"in the case of lolita, he never succeeds in possessing her willingly, so that every act of lovemaking from then on becomes a crueler and more tainted act of rape; she evades him at every turn."
4044,where,"were he to paint the murals in the enchanted hunters, the motel where he first raped her, he tells us, he would have painted a lake, an arbor in flames and finally there would have been ""a fire opal dissolving within a ripple-ringed pool, a last throb,  reading lolita in tehran  a last dab of color, stinging red, smarting pink, a sigh, a wincing child."""
4045,question,"i felt i had not adequately answered mitra's question, and was tempted to call my magician and talk to him about our discussion."
4046,disaster,most nights i lay awake waiting for some unexpected disaster to descend on our house or for a telephone call that would give us the bad news about a friend or a relative.
4047,jailed,"there i was told that they had just heard on the radio that my father, the youngest mayor in tehran's history, had been jailed."
4048,taken,"i learned later that the general had taken a special liking to him after my father's welcoming speech, which was delivered in french and filled with allusions to great french writers such as chateaubriand and victor hugo."
4049,imprisonment,the reality of my father's imprisonment was established for me when i landed at the tehran airport and did not find him waiting for me there.
4050,jail,"for the four years that they kept him in his ""temporary"" jail-in the jail's library, adjacent to the morgue-we were told alternately that he was going to be killed or that he would be set free almost at once."
4051,charges,"he was eventually exonerated of all charges except one, insubordination."
4052,sentence,"much later, when i read a sentence by nabokov-""curiosity is insubordination in its purest form""-the verdict against my father came to my mind."
4053,jail,"i never recovered from the shock of that moment when i was pulled out of the security of mr. holmes's-i think that was his name-stern classroom and told that my father, the mayor, was now in jail."
4054,jail,"later, the islamic revolution took away whatever sense of security i had managed to reestablish after my father's release from jail."
4055,inside,"she could not turn around, open the door and hide inside."
4056,illegal,"later, nima told us that the son of one of his friends, a ten-year-old, had awakened his parents in  reading lolita in tehran  horror telling them he had been having an ""illegal dream."""
4057,illegal,he kept repeating to his parents that he was having illegal dreams.
4058,jail,"in invitation to a beheading, on the wall of cincinnatus c.'s jail, which is decorated like a thirdrate hotel, there are certain instructions for the prisoners, such as: ""a prisoner's meekness is a prison's pride."""
4059,inmate,"rule number six, one that lies at the heart of the novel, is: ""it is desirable that the inmate should not have dreams at all, or if he does, should immediately himself suppress nocturnal dreams whose context might be incompatible with the condition and status of the prisoner, such as: resplendent landscapes, outings with friends, family dinners, as well as sexual intercourse with persons who in real life and in the waking state would not suffer said individual to come near, which individual will therefore be considered by the law to be guilty of rape."""
4060,question,"after our first discussion of lolita, i went to bed excited, thinking about mitra's question."
4061,power,"but the magic comes from the power of good, that force which tells us we need not give in to the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by mcfate, as nabokov called it."
4062,juvenile,"'and it struck me,' "" she read, "" 'as my automaton knees went up and down, that i simply didn't know a thing about my darling's mind and that quite possibly behind the awful juvenile clichés, there was in her a garden and a twilight, and a palace gate-dim adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me, in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions ."
4063,case,"look at salman rushdie's case."""
4064,where,"there must be some blasted space in life,"" she added crossly, ""where we can be offensive, for god's sake."""
4065,crime,"""i mean, my parents are very religious-is that a crime?"""
4066,question,"""well, that is the crux of the great novels,"" manna added, ""like madame bovary or anna karenina, or james's for that matter-the question of doing what is right or what we want to do."""
4067,authority,"""and what if we say that it is right to do what we want to do and not what society or some authority figure tells us to do?"""
4068,case,"our discussion had plunged us into more personal and private arenas, and my girls found that they could not resolve their own dilemmas quite as neatly as they could in the case of emma bovary or lolita."
4069,assault,"i was sure that azin's assault had been partly directed against mahshid, and perhaps indirectly against manna, too."
4070,question,she drew into herself and refused to fill the void that azin's question had left behind.
4071,inside,their only concession had been to try and leave each other alone inside the class.
4072,suspect,would they suspect us of political conspiracy or of a lovers' rendezvous?
4073,awaiting,"after some hesitation, i brought him some photographs of my girls, anxiously awaiting his pronouncement."
4074,inside,"cincinnatus's release by his jailers depends on his discovery of this invisible cord deep inside himself that joins him to another world, so that he can finally escape the staged and fake world of his executioners."
4075,cell,"she said that step by step she could feel herself gradually leaving reality behind her, leaving the dark, dank cell she lived in to surface for a few hours into open air and sunshine."
4076,cell,"then, when it was over, she returned to her cell."
4077,state,"they came to my house in a disembodied state of suspension, bringing to my living room their secrets, their pains and their gifts."
4078,taken,"one student, a girl who had returned from the united states the previous year with her family, was taken to the principal's office: her nails were too long."
4079,guilty,"negar had seen her classmate after they were dismissed, in the school yard, waiting to go home, nursing the guilty finger."
4080,death,"she kept saying, mom, she just doesn't know about our rules and regulations; you know, she just came back from americahow do you think she feels when they force us to trample on the american flag and shout, death to america?"
4081,where,over where?
4082,where,where you buried your dead canary by a rose-bush with your grandfather?
4083,where,where your grandmother brought you chocolates we had forbidden you to eat?
4084,sentence,"from the open dining room door we could hear different noises, the sound of running tap water, the thin clink of pots and pans, half a sentence addressed to the children, who were in the hall by the kitchen, alternately laughing and quarreling."
4085,officers,"there were two plainclothes officers at the door, she explained, men from the revolutionary committee."
4086,arrest,"tahereh khanoom explained that ""they"" wanted to arrest mr."
4087,warrant,"as tahereh khanoom wisely put it, what good is a committee official who doesn't have a search warrant and can only go into people's houses  reading lolita in tehran  through their neighbors' yards?"
4088,warrant,"they needed no search warrant when it came to barging into decent people's houses at all times, so why were they so helpless when it came to this one particular crook?"
4089,wall,they explained that they no longer needed our garden wall to jump over to the neighbor's house: the culprit had now jumped into our garden and was armed and hiding there.
4090,crimes,"they let us know, by implication and gesture, that their prey was dangerous: not only was he an armed drug pusher, but he had other crimes to his name."
4091,guilty,"we, like all normal iranian citizens, were guilty and had something to hide: we were worried about our satellite dish."
4092,charge,"yassi was in charge of looking after my two bewildered children, and i accompanied the two men to our balcony, which opened into our bedroom and gave onto the garden below."
4093,warrant,"like the genie in the aladdin cartoon, one moment i was on the balcony in the middle of cross fire, listening to the committee men threatening the culprit while relating in bits and pieces his sinful history, intimating that he was supported by ""people in high places,"" which explained why they had no official search warrant; next, i was upstairs, assured by tahereh khanoom that the guards were too busy to pay attention to our satellite dish."
4094,criminal,"he warned me insistently about the evil nature of this criminal, who had now taken cover at the farthermost corner of our garden, under the generous shade of my favorite willow."
4095,criminal,"with  reading lolita in tehran  comical despair, they took to bewailing the hopeless nature of their mission to us-we, who considered both sides equally criminal and intrusive and wanted them both out of our lives as soon as possible."
4096,inside,the guards gave us the inside scoop on mr.
4097,arrest,"as it turned out, these predictions were correct: not only was he released, but he came to our door one day soon after his return and tried to persuade tahereh khanoom to lodge a complaint against the revolutionary committee members who had barged into our house to arrest him, something we did not do."
4098,arrested,"in the process, they discovered in the toolshed a small tape recorder in the arrested man's black leather jacket, which he had hidden there."
4099,law,"we were law-abiding citizens and, after listening to an incomprehensible conversation about some trucks, we handed the tape recorder and the jacket over to the committee, despite passionate protests from the children."
4100,power,"despite all the jokes and the power we felt then, the house became a little less secure after that, and for a long time we  reading lolita in tehran  were startled by the sound of the doorbell."
4101,assault,"this constant assault, this persistent lack of kindness, was what frightened me most."
4102,inside,manna used to get excited in a very quiet way; her happiness seemed to come from some unknown depth inside of her.
4103,where,"while we sorted papers and reorganized my office at home, placing the novels side by side, arranging my notes in different files, they shared stories and gossip from the university of tehran, where i had held a post years before."
4104,taken,what was disturbing was that these texts were taken seriously by people who ruled us and in whose hands lay our fate and the fate of our country.
4105,illegal,"they claimed to have received a report of illegal activities, and wanted to search the premises."
4106,warrant,"the truth of the matter was that their search for alcoholic beverages, tapes and cds had led to nothing, but they already had a search warrant and didn't want it to go to waste."
4107,jail,the guards took all of them to a special jail for infractions in matters of morality.
4108,jail,"their jail wardens came into their room two or three times in the middle of the night to wake up those who might have dozed off, and hurled insults at them."
4109,where,"apart from brief excursions to the rest room at appointed times, they left the room twice-the first time to be led to a hospital, where they were given virginity tests by a woman gynecologist, who had her students observe the examinations."
4110,trial,"the girls were then given a summary trial, forced to sign a document confessing to sins they had not committed and subjected to twenty-five lashes."
4111,punishment,"in some perverse way, the physical punishment was a source of satisfaction to her, a compensation for having yielded to those other humiliations."
4112,taken,"when they were finally released and taken home by their parents, sanaz had to deal with another indignity: her brother's admonitions."
4113,guilty,"on top of everything else, i am now the guilty party, she said."
4114,question,"they were not ready then to face that question, but every once in a while i returned to it and asked them again."
4115,jail,"it belongs to sanaz, who handed it in shortly after her jail experience at the seaside."
4116,case,its terribleness goes beyond the fact that in each case an act of violence has been committed.
4117,jailer,"it goes beyond the bars, revealing the victim's proximity and intimacy with its jailer."
4118,prisoner,"our focus in each is on the delicate spot where the prisoner touches the bar, on the invisible contact between flesh and cold metal."
4119,taken,yet we had a past to compare with the present; we had memories and images of what had been taken away.
4120,taken,"it was this lack, their sense of longing for the ordinary, taken-for-granted aspects of life, that gave their words a certain luminous quality akin to poetry."
4121,jailer,i had asked my students if they remember the dance scene in invitation to a beheading: the jailer invites cincinnatus to a dance.
4122,cell,"in a corner they run into a guard: ""they described a circle near him and glided back into the cell, and now cincinnatus regretted that the swoon's friendly embrace had been so brief."""
4123,prisoner,"as long as he accepts the sham world the jailers impose upon him, cincinnatus will remain their prisoner and will move within the circles of their creation."
4124,crime,"the worst crime committed by totalitarian mind-sets is that they force their citizens, including their victims, to become complicit in their crimes."
4125,execution,"dancing with your jailer, participating in your own execution, that is an act of utmost brutality."
4126,power,"they had not become part of the crowd who watched the executions, but they did not have the power to protest them, either."
4127,jailer,"the only way to leave the circle, to stop dancing with the jailer, is to find a way to preserve one's individuality, that unique quality which evades description but differentiates one human being from the other."
4128,execution,"they invaded all private spaces and tried to shape every gesture, to force us to become one of them, and that in itself was another form of execution."
4129,execution,"in the end, when cincinnatus is led to the scaffold, and as he lays his head on the scaffold, in preparation for his execution, he repeats the magic mantra: ""by myself."""
4130,death,their mood is echoed in the black and bloodred slogans: death to america!
4131,building,"it seemed as if a bad witch with her broomstick had flown over the building and in one sweep had taken away the restaurants, the children and the women in colorful clothes that i remembered."
4132,taken,i was taken to a corner.
4133,guard,"bijan, my husband, observed me anxiously, not knowing whom to fear most, the morose guard or me."
4134,case,"first they emptied my bag: lipstick, pens and pencils, my diary and glasses case."
4135,guard,"the guard picked them up disdainfully, as if handling someone else's dirty laundry."
4136,term,"i tried to persianize the landscape and even transferred for a term to a small college in new mexico, mainly because it reminded me of home."
4137,jailed,"when my father was jailed, i went back home and was allowed to stay for a year."
4138,jail,"reading lolita in tehran  i moved with him to norman, oklahoma, where he was getting his master's in engineering at the university of oklahoma, and in six months' time i had reached the conclusion that i would divorce him as soon as my father was out of jail."
4139,law,"my father was all in favor of divorce, and threatened to sue for alimony, a woman's only protection under islamic law."
4140,building,"we would demonstrate in the mornings, taking over the administration building, singing songs on the green in front of the english department, called south oval, watching as the occasional streakers ran across the green towards the redbrick building that was the library."
4141,war,"i marched while the suffering rotc students, in those days of protest against the vietnam war, tried to ignore our presence on the grass."
4142,jail,"later, when my father fell out of favor, my parents managed to make us feel more proud of his term in jail than we had ever been when he was mayor."
4143,imprisonment,"my father's imprisonment and my family's vague nationalist sympathies had sensitized me towards politics, but i was more of a rebel than a political activist-though in those days there was not much difference between them."
4144,assault,one attraction was the fact that the men in the movement didn't try to assault or seduce me.
4145,state,"instead, they held study groups in which we read and discussed engels's origin of the family, private property, and the state and marx's the 18th brumaire of louis bonaparte."
4146,jail,"they were active, and even confrontational, going to jail for occupying the iranian consulate in san francisco."
4147,locked,"during the long and confrontational meetings between rival factions, i would often leave the room under different pretenses, and sometimes locked myself in the bathroom to escape."
4148,jail,"the other one, the tall, friendly department head i had met on my first visit, i was informed, was now in jail."
4149,war,i felt in those days that there was a turf war going on between different political groups and that this struggle was being fought out mainly at the university.
4150,pen,"with coffee in one hand and a pen and notebook in the other, i was preparing to go to the balcony to work on my class syllabus."
4151,death,"over the next two decades, this particular chant would be used for many others, a symptom of the  reading lolita in tehran  symbiosis between the revolution's founders and death."
4152,guilt,"that was the first time i experienced the desperate, orgiastic pleasure of this form of public mourning: it was the one place where people mingled and touched bodies and shared emotions without restraint or guilt."
4153,term,"5 before the new term began in september 1979, i spent most of my time hunting for the books on my syllabus."
4154,law,"i had left most of them in the u.s. with my sister-in-law, along with an antique mirror: my father's present."
4155,law,"i thought i would bring them back later, not knowing that i would not return for another eleven years, by which time my sister-in-law had given away most of my books."
4156,freedom,"the strongest of the opposition groups were ayatollah shariatmadari's muslim people's republican party and the national democratic front, made up of secular progressives who were at the forefront of the struggle to preserve democratic rights, including women's rights and freedom of the press."
4157,death,"they were very popular at the time and drew about a million people on the twelfth anniversary of the death of the late nationalist hero mossadegh to the village of ahamad abad, where mossadegh was buried."
4158,executed,"""after each revolution several thousands of the corrupt elements are executed in public and burned and the story is over."
4159,state,"citing the example of the october revolution and the fact that the state still controlled the press, he went on to say, ""we will close all parties except the one, or a few which will act in a proper manner ."
4160,term,"the students were curious about me and dr. k, the curly-haired young man i had bumped into at dr. a's office, strange new recruits at a time when most students were doing their best to expel their professors: they were all ""anti-revolutionary,"" a term that covered a vast range-anything from working with the previous regime to using obscene language in class."
4161,term,"i told them we would come back to this term, because my understanding of it was somewhat different from its usual definition."
4162,question,the best fiction always forced us to question what we took for granted.
4163,murder,"i remember one day when my leftist students had canceled classes, protesting the fresh murder of three revolutionaries, i was walking downstairs when they caught up with me."
4164,wall,"we went on talking fitzgerald as we walked down the wide staircase, past the various tables with their political goods for sale and the rather large crowd assembled in front of a wall plastered with newspapers."
4165,criminals,"6 ""criminals should not be tried."
4166,criminal,the trial of a criminal is against human rights.
4167,criminals,"human rights demand that we should have killed them in the first place when it became known that they were criminals,"" proclaimed ayatollah khomeini, responding to protests by international human rights organizations of the wave of executions that followed the revolution."
4168,murder,"the jubilant mood of celebration and freedom that had followed the shah's overthrow soon gave way to apprehension and fear as the regime continued to execute and murder ""anti-revolutionaries"" and a new vigilante justice emerged as bands of self-organized  reading lolita in tehran  militants terrorized the streets."
4169,detention,"name: omid gharib sex: male date of arrest: 9 june 1980 place of arrest: tehran place of detention: tehran, qasr prison charges: being westernized, brought up in a westernized family; staying too long in europe for his studies; smoking winston cigarettes; displaying leftist tendencies."

4176,death,"when in the states we had shouted death to this or that, those deaths seemed to be more symbolic, more abstract, as if we were encouraged by the impossibility of our slogans to insist upon them even more."
4177,death,there was seldom a day when our routine was not interrupted by a death or assassination.
4178,building,"on a mild day in october, i tried to make my way through a crowd that had gathered in front of our building around a well-known leftist professor from the history department."
4179,where,"i hastily made my way up the stairs to the conference room of the english department, where i had an appointment with a student, mr. bahri."
4180,war,"in between these lunches we went to the film club, which had not yet been closed down, and watched mel brooks and antonioni movies, marched off to exhibitions and still believed that the khomeini crowd could not succeed, that the war was not yet over."
4181,jail,"after a while even the revolution found its rhythm: the violence, the executions, public confessions to crimes that had never been committed, judges who coolly talked about amputating a thief's hand or legs and killing political prisoners because there was not enough room for them now in jail."
4182,crimes,only they were casually agreeing that his crimes were so heinous that the only way he could atone for them and save his family's honor was to embrace death.

4189,taken,"unlike the generals, these were not photographs taken after the executions."
4190,sentences,"he spoke slowly, as if forming his ideas in the process of expressing them, pausing between words and sentences."
4191,power,"she resented the fact that her veil, which to her was a symbol of her sacred relationship to god, had now become an instrument of power, turning the women who wore them into political signs and symbols."
4192,state,"where  reading lolita in tehran  do your loyalties lie, mr. bahri, with islam or the state?"
4193,where,9 i do not remember what i was doing or where i was on that sunday when i first heard the news that the american embassy had been occupied by a ragtag group of students.
4194,criminals,"it is strange, but the only thing i remember was that it was sunny and mild, and the news did not sink in until the next day, when ahmad, khomeini's son, announced his father's support of the students and issued a defiant statement: ""if they do not give us the criminals,"" he said, referring to the shah and bakhtiar, ""then we will do whatever is necessary."""

4200,police,i hear the american police are confiscating all portraits of the imam.
4201,term,long-term allies .
4202,death,even those who wished its death were obsessed by it.
4203,where,"i had just returned to my home, where i could speak at last in my mother tongue, and here i was longing to talk to someone who spoke english, preferably with a new york accent, someone who was intelligent and appreciated gatsby and häagen-dazs and knew about mike gold's lower east side."
4204,court,"this was partly based on fact, since the first two times i tried to leave i was turned down at the airport and once i was even escorted back to the headquarters of the revolutionary court."
4205,term,the essay in its time attracted a great deal of attention and gave birth to a new term in the annals of american literature: the proletarian writer.
4206,taken,the fact that it could be influential and taken seriously by serious authors was a sign of changing times.
4207,where,"this made gatsby seem oddly irrelevant, a strange choice to teach at a university where almost all the students were burning with revolutionary zeal."
4208,outlaw,"this made it easier for the new ruling elite to pass some of the most reactionary laws, going so far as to outlaw certain gestures and expression of emotions, including love."

4210,crimes,"adultery in tehran was one of so many other crimes, and the law dealt with it accordingly: public stoning."
4211,conviction,"and to the subtle but invincible conviction of solidarity that knits together the loneliness of innumerable hearts, to the solidarity in dreams, in joy, in sorrow, in aspirations, in illusions, in hope, in fear which binds men to each other, which binds together all humanity-the dead to the living and the living to the unborn."""

4213,sentences,such sentences could have come out of any newspaper in iran.
4214,inside,"fitzgerald does not tell you-he takes you inside the room and re-creates the sensual experience of that hot summer day so many decades ago, and we, the readers, draw our breath along with tom as we realize what has just happened between gatsby and daisy."

4216,death,"""-""death to america!"""
4217,war,"one of the most significant of these was over women's rights: from the very start, the government had  reading lolita in tehran  waged a war against women, and the most important battles were being fought then."
4218,power,"the unveiling of women mandated by reza shah in 1936 had been a controversial symbol of modernization, a powerful sign of the reduction of the clergy's power."

4220,taken,"i did not want to enter a debate with mahtab and her friends, whose marxist organization had tacitly taken sides with the government, denouncing the protesters as deviant, divisive and ultimately acting in the service of the imperialists."

4222,death,"do you mean the prostitutes they recently stoned to death or my former school principal, mrs. parsa, who, like the prostitutes, was accused of ""corruption on earth,"" ""sexual offenses"" and ""violation of decency and morality,"" for having been the minister of education?"
4223,alleged,for which alleged offenses she was put in a sack and either stoned or shot to death?

4240,trial,"she described how one day she had been watching the trial of a secret-police agent on television when a familiar voice, dr. a's, attracted her attention."

4244,trial,dr. a's student regrets in her account that she participated in his trial without voicing a protest.
4245,murder,but if you understand their different dimensions you cannot easily murder them.

4249,case,"i told him they had no proof that the gentleman in question was a cia agent, and in any case i doubted the cia would be foolish enough to employ someone like him."
4250,guilt,"but even those whom he  reading lolita in tehran  called the functionaries of the old regime, regardless of their guilt, shouldn't be treated this way."
4251,executed,"i could not understand why the islamic government had to gloat over these people's deaths, brandishing their photographs after they had been tortured and executed."
4252,sentences,why did our students every day shout slogans demanding new death sentences?
4253,trial,they are on trial for their past deeds.
4254,crimes,the iranian nation will not tolerate their crimes.
4255,crimes,and these new crimes?
4256,crimes,he repeated that people had to pay for their past crimes.
4257,trial,i asked him if i too was on trial for my past.
4258,crimes,"we all had to pay, but not for the crimes we were accused of."
4259,power,"his two hands were joined in front of him in an expression of reverence for me, his teacher, but in his strained grimace i could feel his sense of power."
4260,case,and i reminded him that any such action would in any case be useless as the gentleman was already dead.
4261,trial,"i suggested, in these days of public prosecutions, that we put gatsby on trial: mr. nyazi would be the prosecutor, and he should also write a paper offering his evidence."
4262,trial,"we could not have a proper trial, of course, but we could have a prosecutor, a lawyer for the defense and a defendant; the rest of the class would be the jury."
4263,prosecution,but then mr. nyazi and his friends objected: this student was biased against the prosecution.
4264,case,"i argued that in that case, i should be not the defense but the defendant and promised to cooperate closely with my lawyer and to talk in my own defense."
4265,trial,it was agreed that in this trial the rest of the class could at any point interrupt the defense or the prosecution with their own comments and questions.
4266,trial,was it necessary to put this book on trial?
4267,taken,i was somewhat taken aback.
4268,trial,"17 all through the week before the trial, whatever i did, whether talking to friends and family or preparing for classes, part of my mind was constantly occupied on shaping my arguments for the  reading lolita in tehran  trial."
4269,law,"bijan, who seemed quite amused by all of this, told me one day that i was studying gatsby with the same intensity as a lawyer scrutinizing a textbook on law."
4270,case,so you have to win this case.
4271,trial,"on the day of the trial, i left for school early and roamed the leafy avenues before heading to class."
4272,trial,"mahtab, with more animation than usual, told me that nassrin's english was better than most college kids', and when she'd told her about gatsby's trial, she was so curious that she'd read the whole book."
4273,trial,"after the trial, nassrin asked permission to continue attending my classes whenever she could."
4274,term,"i told nassrin she could come to my class on one condition: at the end of term, she would have to write a fifteen-page paper on gatsby."
4275,guilty,her responses were always reluctant and forced; one felt almost guilty for making her talk.
4276,charged,"when i entered the classroom that afternoon, i felt a charged silence follow me in."
4277,trial,i spoke briefly about the next week's assignment and proceeded to set the trial in motion.
4278,wall,"i sat beside zarrin on the left side of the room, by the large window, and mr. nyazi sat with some of his friends on the other side, by the wall."
4279,case,and so began the case of the islamic republic of iran versus the great gatsby.
4280,state,mr. nyazi was called to state his case against the defendant.
4281,pen,"that is why our imam says that the pen is mightier than the sword."""
4282,court,"mr. farzan was too inept a judge to pay attention, but one of mr. nyazi's friends cried out: ""your honor, could you please instruct the gentlemen and ladies in the back to respect the court and the prosecutor?"""
4283,inside,today we have planted islam's flag of victory inside the nest of spies on our own soil.
4284,taken,"""the prosecutor has taken up fifteen precious minutes of our time without saying a single word about the defendant."
4285,where,"where is this all going?"""
4286,court,"then mr. nyazi said, without looking at zarrin, ""this is an islamic court, not perry mason."
4287,case,"i can present my case the way i want to, and i am setting the context."
4288,power,"""all through this revolution we have talked about the fact that the west is our enemy, it is the great satan, not because of its military might, not because of its economic power, but because of, because of""-another pause-""because of its sinister assault on the very roots of our culture."
4289,rape,"this i would call a rape of our culture,"" mr. nyazi stated, using a term that later became the hallmark of the islamic republic's critique of the west."
4290,rape,"""and if you want to see cultural rape, you need go no further than this very book."""
4291,prosecution,"mr. nyazi was clearly agitated as he conjured the fornicators, liars and adulterers roaming freely in fitzgerald's luminous world, immune from his wrath and from prosecution."
4292,captive,"""what kind of model are we setting for our innocent and modest sisters,"" he asked his captive audience, ""by giving them such a book to read?"""
4293,illegal,"""he earns his money by illegal means and tries to buy the love of a married woman."
4294,trial,somehow it did not occur to any of us to suggest that he return to his original seat as the trial proceeded.
4295,case,18 zarrin was summoned next to defend her case.
4296,prosecutors,"she waited a few seconds after mr. nyazi's outburst before saying calmly, ""i seem to be confronting two prosecutors."
4297,freedom,"""i would like to remind the prosecutor and the jury of the quotation we were given at our first discussion of this book from diderot's jacques le fataliste: 'to me the freedom of [the author's] style is almost the guarantee of the purity of his morals.'"
4298,trial,"""gatsby is being put on trial because it disturbs us-at least some of us,"" she added, triggering a few giggles."
4299,state,"""this is not the first time a novel-a non-political novel-has been put on trial by a state."""
4300,case,in each case the novel won.
4301,prosecution,"he apparently is both witness and prosecution, but let us bring our witnesses from the book itself."
4302,suspects,"""nick, of course, and you remember how he describes himself: 'everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: i am one of the few honest people that i have ever known.'"
4303,term,"""the other characters are ultimately judged in term of their honesty."
4304,crime,"his dishonesty is more obvious: he cheats on his wife, he covers up her crime and he feels no guilt."
4305,case,"daisy's case is more complicated because, like everything else about her, her insincerity creates a certain enchantment: she makes others feel they are complicit in her lies, because they are seduced by them."
4306,burglar,'it never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people-with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.'
4307,question,"so the question of honesty and dishonesty, the way people are and the way they present themselves to the world, is a sub-theme that colors all the main events in the novel."
4308,question,i was startled by zarrin's sudden question but appreciated this opportunity to focus on a point that had been central to my own discussions about fiction in general.
4309,power,"""and if,"" she continued with some warmth, ""mr. farzan, in real life fitzgerald was obsessed with the rich and with wealth; in his fiction he brings out the corrupt and decaying power of wealth on basically decent people, like gatsby, or creative and lively people, like dick diver in tender is the night."
4310,trial,"during the course of my preparations for the trial, i had found that no matter how hard i tried, i could not articulate in words the thoughts and emotions that made me so excited about gatsby."
4311,trial,i joined them and asked them what they thought of the trial.
4312,law,"""and this is the law, and whoever ."
4313,law,"""the law?"""
4314,law,is it the law?
4315,nazi,so was wearing the yellow star in nazi germany.
4316,law,"should all the jews have worn the star because it was the blasted law?"""
4317,authority,"""i think it's about time i used my authority,"" i whispered to nassrin, who was standing by, transfixed."
4318,trial,"we wouldn't vote on the outcome of the trial, but we should hear from the jury."
4319,jailed,one woman novelist was jailed for her writings and charged with spreading prostitution.
4320,jailed,"reporters were jailed, magazines and newspapers closed and some of our best classical poets, like rumi and omar khayyam, were censored or banned."
4321,trial,"personally, the gatsby ""trial"" had opened a window into my own feelings and desires."
4322,trial,i hear he quieted down the voices of outrage and somehow convinced the islamic association that you had put america on trial.
4323,trial,"20 a few days after the gatsby trial, i hastily gathered my notes and books and left the classroom somewhat preoccupied."
4324,trial,the aura of the trial still dominated the class.
4325,conviction,"the voice gave as his reason his conviction that as far as he was concerned, there was no one, and he meant no one, certainly no revolutionary leader or political hero, more important than racine."
4326,trial,he had walked to the podium in the silence that had already put him on trial.
4327,imprisoned,"i was told that he almost imprisoned himself in his apartment, meeting with a select group of friends and disciples."
4328,question,"we have been talking about what gatsby is all about and we've mentioned some themes, but there is an overall undercurrent to the novel which i think determines its essence and that is the question of loss, the loss of an illusion."
4329,criminals,"""he earns his money through unlawful activities and he consorts with criminals."""
4330,where,"he did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.'"
4331,where,"one autumn night they stop at a place where ""the sidewalk was white with moonlight."
4332,possession,""" for gatsby, access to wealth is a means to an end; it is a means to the possession of his dream."
4333,power,"that dream removes from him the power to differentiate between imagination and reality-of ""foul dust"" he tries to create a fairyland."
4334,power,"but it is also about wealth, its great attraction as well as its destructive power, the carelessness that comes with it, and, yes, it is about the american dream, a dream of power and wealth, the beguiling light of daisy's house and the port of entry to america."
4335,where,"we would walk to our favorite pastry shop, where they had amazing cream puffs, made with real cream."
4336,where,"i walked down the street until the bookstores gave way to other shops, and to a movie house where we used to go as children that was now closed."
4337,death,"i had a feeling that day that i was losing something, that i was mourning a death that had not yet occurred."
4338,where,"i felt as if all things personal were being crushed like small wildflowers to make way for a more ornate garden, where everything would be tame and organized."
4339,war,"for the past year the government had been preoccupied with suppressing opposition groups, closing down the progressive newspapers and magazines, punishing former government functionaries and carrying on a war against the minorities, especially the kurds."
4340,power,"now it turned its attention towards the universities, hotbeds of dissent, where the muslim revolutionaries did not hold power."
4341,suppression,the universities played the role of the now-banned newspapers in protesting the suppression of progressive forces.
4342,building,"one morning as i entered the department building, i could sense that something was wrong."
4343,wall,"an enlarged photograph of hashemi rafsanjani, who at the time was the speaker of the parliament, was pasted to the wall opposite the entrance."
4344,power,this committee was given  reading lolita in tehran  the power to reconstruct the universities in such a way as to make them acceptable to the leaders of the islamic republic.
4345,power,"they were given the power to expel undesirable faculty, staff and students, to create a new set of rules and a new curriculum."
4346,power,"if the leftists had come to power, they would have done the same thing."
4347,gate,"one moment we were standing in front of the wide iron gate of the university and then i found myself running towards the bookstores, most of which had closed because of the unrest."
4348,where,"she told me everyone was moving towards the hospital near the university of tehran, where the bodies of murdered and wounded students were supposedly being kept."
4349,police,the rumor now was that the police and guards had stolen the bodies of murdered students in order to prevent the news of their death from getting out.
4350,building,"i walked towards the main building, and now in my memory i seem to be forever walking towards that building, never quite reaching it: i was walking in a trance, with people running towards me as well as in the opposite direction."
4351,where,no one knew where the bodies had been transferred.
4352,police,"they kept their vigil until, in what almost amounted to a bloody battle-although the government forces were the only ones with guns-they were evacuated and the militia, the revolutionary guards and the police conquered the university grounds."
4353,jailed,some students were killed or jailed; others simply disappeared.
4354,law,the newly elected committee for the implementation of the cultural revolution visited the faculty of law and political sciences and the faculty of persian and foreign languages and literature at the auditorium in the school of law.
4355,torture,farideh took the committee to task for using the university grounds to torture and intimidate the students.
4356,freedom,the issue was not so much the veil itself as freedom of choice.
4357,jailed,"little did i know that i would soon be given the choice of either veiling or being jailed, flogged and perhaps killed if i disobeyed."
4358,guard,"and the morality squads, with their guns and toyota patrols, would guard the streets to ensure our adherence."
4359,trial,the government would make the veil mandatory and put more students and faculty members on trial.
4360,arrested,"over a thousand people were arrested, many, including teenagers, executed on the spot."
4361,where,"i would like to know where mr. bahri is right now, at this moment, and to ask him: how did it all turn out, mr. bahri-was this your dream, your dream of the revolution?"
4362,executed,who will pay for the snapshots of the murdered and the executed that we hid in our shoes and closets as we moved on to other things?
4363,war,"part iii james 1 the war came one morning, suddenly and unexpectedly."
4364,death,"the newscaster announced it matter-of-factly, the way people announce a birth or a death, and we accepted it as an irrevocable fact that would permeate all other considerations and gradually insinuate itself into the four corners of our lives."
4365,war,reading lolita in tehran  what triggered the war?
4366,war,"for me, as for millions of ordinary iranians, the war came out of nowhere one mild fall morning: unexpected, unwelcome and utterly senseless."
4367,war,"all through that fall i took long walks around the wide, leafy alleys near our home, surrounded by scented gardens and meandering streams, and thought of my own ambivalence towards the war, for my anger was mixed with feelings of love and a desire to protect my home and country."
4368,war,"down the slope of the street, on the wall to my right, in big black letters, was a quotation from ayatollah khomeini: this war is a great blessing for us!"
4369,war,2 the war with iraq began that september and did not end until late july 1988.
4370,war,"everything that happened to us during those eight years of war, and the direction our lives took afterward, was in some way shaped by this conflict."
4371,war,"it was not the worst war in the world, although it left over a million dead and injured."
4372,war,at first the war seemed to pull the divided country together: we were all iranian and the enemy had attacked our homeland.
4373,inside,"not only were the forces of god fighting an emissary of satan, iraq's saddam hussein, but they were also fighting agents of satan inside the country."
4374,war,"at all times, from the very beginning of the revolution and all through the war and after, the islamic regime never forgot its holy battle against its internal enemies."
4375,national security,all forms of criticism were now considered iraqi-inspired and dangerous to national security.
4376,war,those groups and individuals without a sense of loyalty to the regime's brand of islam were excluded from the war effort.
4377,war,"iran's war with iraq was the same as the war carried on by the third and most militant imam, imam hussein, against the infidels, and the iranians were going to conquer karballa, the holy city in iraq where imam hussein's shrine was located."
4378,war,"it took us a while to understand what the war really meant, although the radio, television and papers were filled with it."
4379,war,never once during the eight years of war did the government create a cohesive program for the safety and security of its citizens.
4380,war,our ambivalent attitude towards the war mainly stemmed from our ambivalence towards the regime.
4381,executed,"hashemi rafsanjani, then speaker of the parliament, in an effort to appease the frightened population, claimed in a friday prayer ceremony that the bombing so far had done no real harm, as its victims were the ""arrogant rich and subversives,"" who probably would have been executed sooner or later anyway."
4382,where,"my friend laleh cried before sitting down at a table in our favorite restaurant,  reading lolita in tehran  where i had been waiting for her."
4383,death,"since we can't drink publicly to my newly acquired status, let's eat ourselves to death,"" she added in a brave effort to make light of a development that would leave her penniless and, more important, force her to give up a job she loved and was good at."
4384,situation,"she had gone to the university that day to discuss her situation with the head of the psychology department, where she had been teaching since her return from germany a few years earlier, and she had not worn a head scarf, of course."
4385,gate,the guard at the gate had called out to her from inside his cage.
4386,guard,"as i imagine it now, the guard's post is literally a cage, a large protrusion of bars, but it may have been more of an outpost; made of metal perhaps?"
4387,guard,have you come across that new guard?
4388,captive,"she asked me, a limp captive lettuce leaf dangling from the end of her fork."
4389,guard,"no, i had not had the pleasure of meeting the aforementioned guard."
4390,pleaded,"could you please lay off the guard of the mournful countenance, i pleaded with her, and get on with your story?"
4391,gate,"i said, i've been going in through this gate like this for the past eight years."
4392,authority,i said with all the authority i could muster.
4393,authorities,"i mean, all he had to do was take the bloody phone and call the higher authorities."
4394,inside,she made a swinging movement with her fork inside the mashed potatoes.
4395,guard,"laleh and the fat guard had sprinted across the wide, leafy avenues of the university."
4396,building,"laleh ran by three startled students, made it down the short steps leading to the faculty of persian and foreign languages and literature, nearly toppled herself as her heel caught in a crack, passed the wide open area in front of the building, ran up past the open door into the cool, dark hall and up the wide flights of stairs to the second floor, where she came to a sudden halt at the entrance to the department of psychology and nearly fell into the arms of her department head, who was standing in the doorway talking to a colleague."
4397,guard,"a few moments later the dutiful guard, sweat trickling down his cheeks like tears of desperation, his cap in his hand, came to a grinding halt by the door."
4398,authorities,"there he made his explanations and the department head, not knowing whether to laugh or frown, dismissed him, promising to make a proper report to the proper authorities."
4399,gate,"an hour later laleh had emerged from the door of the department, walked back to the entrance gate and, without so much as glancing at the guard, had marched out, a free woman."
4400,taken,"later, when she would climb the trees with my three-year-old daughter, i could see the amount of discipline it must have taken for her to control her wayward longings."
4401,ordered,"our appetites that day seemed insatiable: laleh ordered a crème caramel and i two scoops of ice cream, vanilla and coffee, with turkish coffee and a side of walnuts."
4402,gate,"i was fully prepared for a running contest at the gate, but to my surprise i was not accorded the same treatment as laleh."
4403,guard,the morose guard on duty was not the one she had described.
4404,taken,"they both stood up when i entered, and waited until i had taken a seat before settling back down."
4405,pen,"all through the meeting his eyes appeared to be glued to a black fountain pen, which he kept turning around and around in his hands like a curious object whose mystery he was hoping to fathom."
4406,chain,the big iron bolt and chain they installed on the door signified the finality of their action.
4407,case,"i picked up some dorothy sayers and, to my utter delight, found trent's last case, two or three new agatha christies, a selection of ross macdonalds, all of raymond chandler and two dashiell hammetts."
4408,guilt,"now that i would have a great deal of time on my hands, i could read without any feelings of guilt."
4409,jail,"disobedience was punished by fines, up to seventy-six lashes and jail terms."
4410,notorious,"later, the government created the notorious morality squads: four armed men and women in white toyota patrols, monitoring the streets, ensuring the enforcement of the laws."
4411,war,"as i try now to piece together the disjointed and incoherent events of that period, i notice how my growing sense that i was descending into an abyss or void was accompanied by two momentous events that happened simultaneously: the war and the loss of my teaching job."
4412,illegal,"now that i could not call myself a teacher, a writer, now that i could not wear what i would normally wear, walk in the streets to the beat of my own body, shout if i wanted to or pat a male colleague on the back on the spur of the moment, now that all this was illegal, i felt light and fictional, as if i were walking on air, as if i had been written into being and then erased in one quick swipe."
4413,guard,"the female guard told me to hold my hands up, up and up, she said, as she started to search me meticulously, going over every part of my body."
4414,inside,the woman's coarse hands were reverse x rays that left only the surface intact and made the inside invisible.
4415,authority,"then, of course, from time to time i would make part of me return, like when i wished to defy an obstructionist figure of authority and i would leave a few strands of hair out and make my eyes reappear, to stare at them uncomfortably."
4416,where,"they saw hands, faces and pink lipstick; they saw strands of hair and unruly socks where i saw some ethereal being drifting soundlessly down the street."
4417,term,"he felt creative and he felt wanted, and, in the very best sense of the term, he felt he was of some service to his country."
4418,murder,"i picked up murder on the orient express, sense and sensibility, the master and margarita, herzog, the gift, the count of monte cristo, smiley's people-any book i could get my hands on in my father's library, in secondhand bookstores, in the still-unravaged libraries in friends' houses-and read them all, an alcoholic drowning her inarticulate sorrows."
4419,justice,"my daughter, negar, blushes every time i tell her that her particular brand of obstinacy, her passionate defense of what she considers to be justice, comes from her mother's reading too many nineteenth-century novels when she was pregnant with her."
4420,authority,negar has a way of throwing her head to the right and back in one move and pursing her lips just a little in defiance of whatever authority she is protesting at the moment.
4421,power,"there was such a teasing, playful quality to their words, such joy in the power of language to delight and astonish."
4422,where,"between us on the table he had set a tray with two dark green mugs of tea and a box of chocolates, immaculate squares of red with black lettering: lindt, a rare luxury, all the more so because they could not be found in the shops where foreign chocolates were sold at exorbitant prices."
4423,sentences,"he finished my sentences for me, articulated my wishes and demands, and by the time i left, we  reading lolita in tehran  already had a plan."
4424,state,"we had talked about my present life, the intellectual state of affairs and then about james and rumi all in one breath."
4425,term,"he called me ""lady professor""-a term less odd and more often used in iran than here."
4426,war,the lack of progress in the war with iraq was taking its toll.
4427,power,"those who had been ardent revolutionaries at the start of the revolution-people now in their late teens and early twenties-and the younger generation, who were coming of age, were discovering the cynicism and corruption of the leaders who had taken power."
4428,war,"i remember our first meeting well, partly because it was during one of those periods known in the history of the war as ""the war of the cities."""
4429,where,"we then moved to the hall, where we felt more secure, because there were fewer windows."
4430,inside,"what i cannot describe is her energy, which seemed to be caged inside her body."
4431,state,"sometimes she would come to my house unexpectedly, in such an anxious state that i would think some disaster had befallen her."
4432,death,she always framed these requests as matters of life and death.
4433,state,"the state of literature in this country could not be any worse, and the state of english literature is most hopeless of all."
4434,freedom,what about the freedom to teach what i wanted?
4435,pleading,"she was like an intermediary pleading on behalf of an unfaithful and unforgotten lover, pledging complete loyalty in return for my affections."
4436,wall,"the space inside was narrow and shaped like a wide curve, with seven or eight stools on one side of the bar and, on the other, next to the wall-length mirror, another set of stools."
4437,ordered,"we ordered and i said breathlessly, this is an emergency."
4438,situation,"then somehow i managed to divert my own emergency meeting into a discussion of the book i was immersed in at the moment, dashiell hammett's the continental op, and steve marcus's marvelous essay on hammett in which he cited a line from nietzsche that struck me as pertinent to our situation."
4439,where,"he raised an eyebrow with an indulgent smile: lady, he said at last, will you please wise up to where you live?"
4440,law,"i told him that this was now the law of the land, that i could no longer appear anywhere in public without the veil and that therefore i would wear it."
4441,freedom,"he was surprised, but decided to accede, at least in principle, to my requirement for freedom."
4442,wall,"he focused on the design of the carpet, or targeted the wall."
4443,pen,"sometimes he would play with his pen, looking at it intently, reminding me of my last meeting with mr. bahri."
4444,situation,"had we not lived in the islamic republic, i might have shown some sense of humor about our awkward situation, for it was obvious that it was more embarrassing and painful to him than it was to me; and it was clear that he was curious and eager to discuss with me matters of which he knew little, like english literature, and just as eager to show off his knowledge of plato and aristotle."
4445,taken,"in asking me to join the faculty, they had taken certain risks."
4446,criminal,i called their indifference criminal.
4447,war,"i cannot separate the eight years of war from that shrill voice that several times a day, at the most unexpected hours, would intrude into our lives."
4448,case,"usually the red siren sounded too late, after the bomb had already been dropped, and in any case, even at the university we had no real shelters to repair to."
4449,wall,"a few minutes later i was ready with my pillows up against the wall, two lit candles and my book."
4450,war,"i am afraid of the dark, but the war and its explosions had made that fear insignificant."
4451,sentence,"there is so much courage in that sentence, and irony in the fact that what winterbourne was afraid of was not his aunt but miss daisy miller's charms."
4452,taken,"almost every night after the explosions, my mother came in with her candle; her action had taken on the form of a ritual."
4453,death,"this had also become a ritual, to call friends and family to make sure they were safe, knowing that your own relief implied someone else's death."
4454,building,"12 there were the sirens and the mechanical voice that commanded you to attention, the sandbags in the streets and bombs usually early in the morning or after midnight; there were long or short periods of calm in between the bombings and their resumption, and there were austen and james and the different classrooms on the fourth floor of the building that housed the faculty of persian and foreign languages and literature."
4455,building,"suddenly and magically, without passing the green gate and the guard, without passing the glass entrance door to the building with signs denouncing western culture, i am inside the faculty of persian and foreign languages and literature, standing at the bottom of the stairs."
4456,war,"they are mainly black-and-white photographs of the war with iraq, and slogans denouncing the great satan, namely america, and the emissaries of that satan."
4457,war,this war has been a divine blessing for us!-accompany the pictures.
4458,inside,"i still have both the envelope and the yellowing piece of paper i found inside, folded once to fit."
4459,charges,"what made me feel cheap, and in some way complicit, was the knowledge that so many people had been deprived of  reading lolita in tehran  their livelihood on the basis of similar charges-because they had laughed loudly in public, because they had shaken hands with a member of the opposite sex."
4460,escaped,should i just thank my lucky stars that i escaped with no more than one line scrawled on a cheap piece of paper?
4461,where,"i asked her as i picked up my book and notes, where have you been?"
4462,arrested,"in the barest outline, which i never dared ask her to detail, she informed me that soon after that day when i had last seen her, she and a few of her comrades had been arrested while distributing leaflets in the streets."
4463,executed,"they executed so many of my friends, but initially gave me only ten years."
4464,probation,"then for a while they wouldn't let me pursue my education and i was, still am, under probation."
4465,wall,"to their right, by the wall, are the two members of the muslim students' association."
4466,wall,"as i talk, my gaze involuntarily shifts to the last chair by the wall in the last row."
4467,where,"when i spoke, he paused respectfully, and as soon as i finished, he would go on in the same monotonous way and continue exactly where he had left off."
4468,war,"the first time, my first semester at allameh, he hardly ever attended, under the pretext that he was in the militia and involved in the war effort."
4469,war,his war efforts always remained vague: he had not enlisted and had never been to the front.
4470,war,the war had become a good excuse for some of the islamic activists to force undeserved privileges from the faculty.
4471,war,"i never quite knew if the lie about the war had become so much a part of his life that he had begun to believe in it, but he seemed to be genuinely hurt and for no good reason i felt almost guilty every time i encountered him."
4472,abuse,"whenever i confronted students like him, i missed mr. bahri, who had had enough respect for the university never to abuse his position."
4473,question,"ever since clarissa harlow and sophia western-two modest and seemingly obedient daughtersrefused to marry men they did not love, they changed the course of narrative and laid open to question the most basic institutions of their times, beginning with marriage."
4474,death,he wants to know why miss f in the third row felt that death was not her just reward.
4475,war,"we are more moral, because we've experienced real evil; we are in a war against evil, he says, a war both at home and abroad."
4476,war,"when he was  reading lolita in tehran  young, there was a civil war in america, and before he died he had witnessed the first world war."
4477,question,and why did her simple question irritate me so?
4478,authority,"i am now positive that my hedging and hesitation, my avoidance of a straight answer, my insistence on the fact that ambiguity was central to the structure of the jamesian novel, badly disappointed her and that from then on i lost some of my authority with her."
4479,death,but her death is almost predetermined by winterbourne's reaction.
4480,death,miss ruhi asked why the novel did not end with daisy's death.
4481,death,daisy's death seemed like a nice ending for all parties concerned.
4482,guilt,"mr. ghomi could gloat over the fact that she had paid for her sins with her life, and most others in the class could now sympathize with her without any feeling of guilt."
4483,death,"now, after daisy's death, winterbourne ironically reminds his aunt, "" 'you were right in that remark that you made last summer."
4484,where,"you see this is a chair, but when you come to describe it, you do so from where you are positioned, and from your own perspective, and so you cannot say there is only one way of seeing a chair, can you?"
4485,case,"in one instance she mentioned that she had objected to wuthering heights's immorality until she read somewhere about its mystical aspects, but in james's case there seemed to be no mysticism involved-he was very earthy, if at times too idealistic."
4486,murder,he also took to pasting in his notebook newspaper clippings reporting murder and corruption in the united states.
4487,inside,"this slogan, when it appeared, was usually accompanied by a drawing of a predatory half-open oyster shell revealing a glossy pearl inside."
4488,where,"mina had been recalled from a two-year sabbatical at boston university, where she'd gone to write her book."
4489,sentence,"she had studied under leon edel, and when i first saw her, it was difficult for her, quite an effort, to utter the simplest sentence."
4490,arrested,"her favorite brother, the president of a large company, had been arrested at the start of the revolution."
4491,jail,"although he was not politically active, he supported the  reading lolita in tehran  monarchy and like his sister he spoke his mind, even in jail."
4492,executed,he was executed.
4493,where,"it was sparsely furnished; there were empty spaces where there should have been chairs, tables and a piano."
4494,case,"i said if that is the case, then they must love james."
4495,inside,"inside, the sudden burst of luminous colors on the screen brought a hushed silence over the audience."
4496,inside,"i had not been inside a movie theater for five years: all you could see in those days were old revolutionary movies from eastern europe, or iranian propaganda films."
4497,deprivation,"looking back on that time it seems to me that such rapture over tarkovsky by an audience most of whom would not have known how to spell his name, and who would under normal circumstances have ignored or even disliked his work, arose from our intense sensory deprivation."
4498,execution,"there was a sense of wonder at being in a public place for the first time in years without fear or anger, being in a place with a crowd of strangers that was not a demonstration, a protest rally, a breadline or a public execution."
4499,war,"the film itself was about war, and about its hero's vow never to speak again if his family was spared from the ravages of war."
4500,war,"it concentrated on the hidden menace behind the seemingly calm flow of everyday life and the lush beauty of nature: the way war made itself felt by the rattle of the furniture caused by the bomber planes, and the terrible sacrifice required to confront this menace."
4501,where,"the sky was blue and pink, the mountains capped with snow; at a distance the smoke curled upwards from the fire where the missile had landed."
4502,war,"after eight years of war, the iranian government had done virtually nothing other than expand its propaganda effort to protect the city."
4503,war,"two years into the war, iran liberated the city of khorramshahr, which had been captured by the iraqis."
4504,where,"any and all methods were used to achieve their purposes, including what became known as ""human wave"" attacks, where thousands of iranian soldiers, mainly very young boys ranging in age from ten to sixteen and middle-aged and old men, cleared the minefields by walking over them."
4505,war,"the islamic associations used every opportunity to disrupt the classes, playing military marches to announce a new victory, or to mourn for a member of the university community who had been martyred in the war."
4506,war,"as the war raged on, with no victories, into the eighth year, signs of exhaustion were apparent even among the most zealous."
4507,war,"by now, in the streets and in public places, people expressed anti-war sentiments or cursed the perpetrators of the war, while on television and radio the regime's ideal continued to play itself out undeterred."
4508,where,these were the dwindling remainders of a once vast group of young people who had been mobilized by the excitement of carrying real guns and the promise of keys to a heaven where they could finally enjoy all the pleasures from which they had abstained in life.
4509,death,"life in death, the death wish of the regime and the obliging missiles of iraq, could only be tolerated when one knew that the missile would deliver the final message at a moment exactly predetermined and that there was no point in trying to escape it."
4510,death,22 i can still hear the mourning and victory marches that disrupted so many classes to announce the death of a student or staff member in the line of duty or some victory of the army of islam over its heathen foe.
4511,death,"the day i have in mind, the march was playing to commemorate the death of one of the leaders of the muslim students' association."
4512,death,they joked that his death was a marriage made in heaven-didn't he and his comrades say that their only beloved was god?
4513,war,"this was an allusion to the last wills and testaments made by the martyrs of the war, which were given a great deal of publicity."
4514,death,"almost all claimed that death by martyrdom was their highest desire, because it promised them ultimate union with their true ""beloved."""
4515,crime,"i don't remember it well: ""indeed we live in dark ages, where to speak of trees is a sort of a crime,"" it went."
4516,building,it fell on an apartment building.
4517,death,they started shouting slogans: death to america!
4518,death,death to saddam!
4519,war,"they kept shouting, 'war!"
4520,war,war!
4521,death,"this was a ritual: after the bombings, these emissaries of death would prevent any sign of mourning or protest."
4522,death,"when two of my cousins were killed by the islamic regime, some of my relatives who were now on the side of the government called my uncle to congratulate him on the death of his son and daughter-in-law."
4523,jail,nassrin told me more about her time in jail.
4524,jails,"you're worried about our brutal thoughts against ""them,"" she said, but you know most of the stories you hear about the jails are true."
4525,execution,we knew they had been picked for execution.
4526,charge,they brought her in on some trumpedup immorality charge.
4527,guard,they passed her from one guard to another.
4528,jail,"that story got around jail very fast, because the girl wasn't even political; she wasn't with the political prisoners."
4529,where,"if i were not privileged, she said with rancor, if i were not blessed with a father who shared their faith, god knows where i would be now-in hell with all the other molested virgins or with those who put a gun to someone's head to prove their loyalty to islam."
4530,situation,"23 on august 4, 1914, henry james added an entry to his journal: ""everything blackened over for the time blighted by the hideous public situation."
4531,war,"in his last two years of life, henry james was radically transformed by his intense involvement in the first world war."
4532,war,"he wrote about his experience of world war i that it ""almost killed me."
4533,war,"when still very young, james had witnessed the civil war in america."
4534,war,"physically, he was prevented from participating in a war in which his two younger brothers fought with courage and honor by a mysterious backache, acquired on a mission to rescue a burning barn."
4535,war,"psychologically, he kept the war at bay by writing and reading."
4536,war,perhaps his frenetic activities to support and aid the british in world war i were partly to compensate for his earlier inactivity.
4537,war,it is also true that the war that had evoked his horror mesmerized him.
4538,disaster,"he wrote to a friend, ""but i have an imagination of disaster-and see life as ferocious and sinister."""
4539,state,"the only respectable state of mind is to constantly express one's perfect dissatisfaction with it."""
4540,power,in almost all of his novels the struggle for power is central to the way the plot moves and is resolved.
4541,power,this struggle for power is rooted in the central character's resistance to socially acceptable norms and in his desire for integrity and recognition.
4542,death,"in daisy miller, the tension between the old and the new leads to daisy's death."
4543,power,"in the ambassadors, it is mrs. newsome's almost awesome power and pressure over her ambassador and her family that creates the central tension in the plot."
4544,war,"during the civil war, when james was discovering his own powers, he wrote in part to  reading lolita in tehran  compensate for his inability to participate in the war."
4545,war,"in an interview on march 21, 1915, with the new york times, he said: ""the war has used up words; they have weakened, they have deteriorated like motor car tires; they have, like millions of other things, been more overstrained and knocked about and voided of the happy semblance during the last six months than in all the long ages before, and we are now confronted with a depreciation of all our terms, or, otherwise speaking, with a loss of expression through increase of limpness, that may well make us wonder what ghosts will be left to walk."""
4546,war,"despite his despair, he turned to words again, this time to write not fiction but war pamphlets, appeals to america to join the war and not to remain indifferent to the suffering and atrocities in europe."
4547,war,in some he expressed his horror at events; in others he consoled friends who had lost a son or a husband in the war.
4548,war,"he fell into a round of activities, visiting wounded belgian soldiers, and later british soldiers, in hospitals, raising money for belgian refugees and the wounded and writing war propaganda from the fall of 1914 until december 1915."
4549,war,"while visiting the hospitals, james likened himself to whitman visiting the wounded during the civil war."
4550,war,"what inner horror and fascination drove this man, who all his life had shied away from public activity, to become so actively involved in the war effort?"
4551,death,"one reason for his involvement was the carnage, the death of so many young men, and the dislocation and destruction."
4552,war,"while he mourned the mutilation of existence, he had endless admiration for the simple courage he encountered, both in the many young men who went to war and in those they left behind."
4553,war,james emphasized in his many letters one important resource to counter the senselessness of the war.
4554,war,"the first was from a letter he wrote to clare sheridan, a friend whose  reading lolita in tehran  husband-they were newly married-had gone to war and been killed."
4555,stir,feeling would stir up empathy and would remind them that life was worth living.
4556,war,one of the peculiarities of james's reaction to the war was the fact that his feelings and emotions were not aroused for patriotic reasons.
4557,war,"his own country, america, was not at war."
4558,where,"britain, the country where he had lived for forty years, was, but in all those forty years he had not asked for british citizenship."
4559,death,"in june 1915, a few months before his death, henry james was granted british nationality."
4560,war,"""hadn't it been for the war, i should certainly have gone on as i was, taking it as the simplest and easiest and even friendliest thing; but the circumstances are utterly altered now."""
4561,police,"his more immediate reason for this sudden reversal was that, because of wartime conditions, he had been categorized as a ""friendly alien"" and needed police permission every time he traveled from london to his home in sussex."
4562,war,but the more important and symbolic reason was his disenchantment with america's distance from the war.
4563,war,"in sussex, during the war, he had found it difficult to read and impossible to work."
4564,crime,"when, in september 1914, the germans attacked and destroyed the rheims cathedral in france, james wrote: ""but no words fill the abyss of it-nor touch it, nor relieve one's heart, nor light by a spark the blackness; the ache of one's heart and the anguish of one's execution aren't mitigated by a shade, even as one brands it as the most hideous crime ever perpetuated against the mind of man."""
4565,power,"all his life had been a struggle for power-not political power, which he disdained, but the power of culture."
4566,freedom,"he had said that the greatest freedom of man was his ""independence of thought,"" which enabled the artist to enjoy the ""aggression of infinite modes of being."""
4567,power,"it is no wonder he used all his powers, not least the power of words, to help those he believed to be in the right."
4568,wall,"mahtab sat on the edge of a chair, while nassrin stood beside her staring at the opposite wall."
4569,question,"she looked at me at first with docile resignation, as if she had not understood my question."
4570,where,"then she fiddled with her fingers, half hidden under the folds of her chador, and said, well, i have been where nassrin was."
4571,arrested,"shortly after the day i saw you at the demonstrations, i was arrested."
4572,jail,she left me to guess what good behavior meant to the kind of people who had put her in jail.
4573,cell,"after the initial interrogations, she  reading lolita in tehran  had been assigned to a cell with fifteen others."
4574,trial,"balancing the small cup of tea i had offered her in one hand, without letting her chador slip, she said, ""razieh told me about your classes on hemingway and james at alzahrah, and i told her about the gatsby trial."
4575,executed,"you know, she was executed."
4576,cell,"i did not want to know how they had lived in their cell, what other memories they had shared."
4577,question,could i ask her my favorite question: did you two fall in love?
4578,jail,"i had heard about so many girls who had married soon after their release from jail, married because they could appease the suspicions of their jailers, who somehow thought of marriage as an antidote to political activities, or to prove to their parents that they were ""good"" girls now, or simply because there was nothing else for them to do."
4579,trial,"we had fun at gatsby's trial, you know?"""
4580,jail,"the fact that they remembered gatsby and even remembered having fun with him would have been gratifying under different circumstances, but then, i was thinking among other thoughts, how the joy of reading gatsby would now be forever marred by being linked in my memory with mahtab's time in jail and razieh's execution."
4581,where,"from my office i could see the yard, where snow almost caressed the trees."
4582,war,"the other quotation from james on the pink index card records his reaction to the death of rupert brooke, the beautiful young english poet who died of blood poisoning during the war."
4583,cell,"yet there must have been something cheerful about razieh and mahtab in their cell, not knowing  reading lolita in tehran  if they will live or die, talking about james and fitzgerald."
4584,where,"i mention this because it is not where i had imagined they would take my favorite novels, my golden emissaries from that other world."
4585,jail,"i think of razieh in that jail, and of razieh facing the firing squad on some night, perhaps the same night i was reading the long goodbye or the bostonians."
4586,case,"i dismissed the class early, although the culprits and a few others stayed behind to plead their case."
4587,where,"""but you must think about where we are coming from."
4588,power,"both razieh and her mother were deeply religious, and it was her religious belief that attracted her to the mujahideen: she felt contempt for the islamists who had usurped power."
4589,poverty,"she said, you know, all my life i have lived in poverty."
4590,where,i don't think any rich kid has ever cherished rebecca or gone with the wind the way i did when i borrowed the translations from houses where my mother worked.
4591,abuse,"she is squeezed in between three colorful, clever, egocentric characters, who abuse and underestimate her while she remains loyal and good."
4592,alleged,"for catherine's heart must be broken twice, once by her alleged lover, and then by her father."
4593,crime,"he is guilty of the same crime of which he accuses morris, namely, lack of love for his daughter."
4594,disaster,"the dress is a disaster; the color does not suit her, and makes her look ten years older."
4595,crime,"thus, dr. sloper commits the most unforgivable crime in fiction-blindness."
4596,freedom,"my generation had tasted individual freedom and lost it; no matter how painful the loss, the recollection was there to protect us from the desert of the present."
4597,disaster,"one can believe james's claim to an ""imagination of disaster""; so many of his protagonists are unhappy in the end, and yet he gives them an aura of victory."
4598,taken,could they have taken him away?
4599,taken,"it kept reverberating like a mantra: they've taken him away, they've taken him away, they've ."
4600,police,"two weeks later they discovered that he had been whisked away by the secret police, for questioning."
4601,question,"i opened it the way we used to open hafez, closing our eyes, asking our question and letting our finger rest somewhere at random."
4602,where,stay where you are; they'll be back for you soon.
4603,situation,i called reza and explained the situation.
4604,transferred,"i let him in, and immediately received his comfort and transferred to him my anxiety and fear."
4605,arrested,"well, the least you could have done is get yourself arrested or come in with your interrogators, i said feebly."
4606,taken,"the kid could easily have taken an ad in the paper, like so many others did, denying that he belonged to the decadent and imperialist sect, disowning his parents-who, luckily, were out of harm's way in europe-and claiming to have been converted by some ayatollah."
4607,taken,that's all it would have taken and the doors would have been opened to him.
4608,possession,"when i returned, i heard reza saying, it's amazing, this obsession with taking possession not just of the living but also of the dead."
4609,toilet,"at the start of the revolution, the revolutionary prosecutor bulldozed reza shah's grave, destroying the monument and creating a public toilet in its place-which he inaugurated by pissing in it."
4610,guilty,"can you imagine feeling guilty about trying to bury your grandmother, to give her any kind of burial, never mind a decent one?"
4611,rape,"what do you say to someone who is telling you about the rape and murder of virgins-i'm sorry, i feel your pain?"
4612,guilt,"of course, with him it was worse: he felt guilt and anger."
4613,taken,"they drove down the same highway they had taken so many times, towards the caspian sea."
4614,inside,"the garden looked like any other garden; behind the mud-brick walls, he could see the tall trees  reading lolita in tehran  inside."
4615,gate,an old man opened the gate and they were led inside.
4616,building,"the kid and his aunt went into a small building, and my magician sat there holding a small bouquet of daffodils and narcissus he had bought along the way."
4617,war,"28 two nights before the announcement of the first cease-fire in the war of cities, a few friends came over to watch john ford's mogambo."
4618,where,"we would bet on when, where and how many missiles would hit the city."
4619,death,"the black-clad men on motorcycles-death's cupbearers, as they were called by some-disappeared from the scenes of bombings, where people increasingly shouted out their despair and anger, cursing both saddam and our own regime."
4620,power,his tremendous power over our destiny had turned him into an intrusive presence.
4621,where,"the place where the regime tried to keep its hold, ironically, was in the realm of our imagination."
4622,war,"this was not only to justify an increasingly unpopular and desperate war, whose end the regime had refused to contemplate until it had ""liberated"" the whole of iraq."
4623,possession,a new one began to spread that spring: iraq had in its possession new and far more powerful missiles that could land on any part of the city without any prior warning whatsoever.
4624,inside,"soon after that, the iraqi chemical bombing of a kurdish town inside iraq heralded an even more horrifying prospect."
4625,where,"rows of ordinary houses and shops gave way to broken windows; then a few houses where the damage was more extensive; then the ruins of a house or two, where only the barest structure could be discerned in the rubble."
4626,murder,"it looked white and innocent enough, like a child who has just committed a murder."
4627,question,"she had asked me this question a long time ago, and every once in a while that anxiety returned to her."
4628,where,"reading lolita in tehran  31 one of the last missiles to land before the cease-fire hit a nearby house, in an alley where two of our friends, a couple and their youngest daughter, lived."
4629,where,"they had a publishing house and bookstore not far from their home, where many iranian writers and intellectuals gathered and where debates raged late into the evening."
4630,where,"in the yard of the house where the missile had landed, two children were lying senseless."
4631,inside,"our hostess led us inside and, gracious as ever, served us fragrant tea and small, delicious pastries."
4632,building,"in the least damaged one, a man and a woman seemed to be searching for things to salvage from what must have been the second floor of the building."
4633,war,"32 the war ended the way it had started, suddenly and quietly."
4634,war,"the effects of the war would stay with us for a long time, perhaps forever."
4635,war,"at first we felt bewildered, and wondered how to go back to what had passed for ordinary life before the war."
4636,ward,the islamic regime had reluctantly accepted peace because of its inability to ward off iraq's attacks.
4637,war,"this mood was reflected in the universities, especially among the militia, the veterans of the war and their affiliates: for them, peace meant defeat."
4638,war,"the war with the external enemy was over, but the war with the domestic one was not."
4639,prisoners,"shortly after the signing of the peace agreement, ayatollah khomeini set up a three-man commission in the iranian jails to decide on the political prisoners' loyalty to the regime."
4640,jail,"several thousand,  reading lolita in tehran  including some who were in jail for years waiting for a trial and some who had served their terms and were to be freed, were executed summarily and in secret."
4641,execution,"the victims of this mass execution were murdered twice, the second time by the silence and anonymity surrounding their executions, which robbed them of a meaningful and acknowledged death and thus, to paraphrase hannah arendt, set a seal on the fact that they had never really existed."
4642,where,"when classes resumed at last, we picked up almost exactly where we had left off."
4643,war,"the war was lost, the economy was in shambles and there were few jobs to be had."
4644,war,those who had gone to the front with no real skills had to depend on the compensations promised to them as war veterans.
4645,war,most of the islamic foundations created in the name of martyrs of the war had degenerated into sources of wealth for their corrupt leaders.
4646,power,those in the islamic associations had tasted power and things western; they used their power principally to gain privileges denied to others.
4647,war,"after the war, islamic jihad, the student association that mr. forsati belonged to, became more open, and also came into more open conflict with the members of the more conservative muslim students' association."
4648,where,"in the next-to-last row on the window side, where mr. ghomi and mr. nahvi would sit, i find a quiet young man, an elementary school teacher."
4649,death,"his death was not officially announced until the next morning at seven a.m., although many iranians, in fact the majority, already knew or suspected it by then, and thousands had gathered outside his house on the outskirts of tehran waiting to hear the news."
4650,taken,"before the announcement, the government had taken the precaution of shutting down the airports, the borders and the international telephone lines."
4651,death,i remember the morning we heard the news of khomeini's death.
4652,state,"our whole family had gathered in the living room, lingering in that state of dull shock and bewilderment that death always brings  reading lolita in tehran  with it."
4653,death,and this was no ordinary death.
4654,death,"it gave us all a feeling of unity and closeness to be sitting in the living room, with the inevitable smell of coffee and tea, speculating about that death: desired by many, feared by many, expected by many and, now that it had occurred, oddly anticlimactic to both friends and foes."
4655,death,"ever since khomeini's first heart attack and hospitalization in the early eighties, rumors of his impending death would crop up like persistent weeds, only to be rooted out again."
4656,law,"my father, who had been separated from my mother for a few years but was living temporarily, after an accident, in my brother's vacant apartment, was present and so was my brother's ex-mother-in-law, who had also taken up temporary lodging in his apartment."
4657,transferred,"his utter comfort in my lap transferred his sense of ease to me as i unconsciously stroked his fine, stillcurly hair and every once in a while touched his soft skin."
4658,death,i always associate khomeini's death with negar's simple pronouncement-for she was right: the day women did not wear the scarf in public would be the real day of his death and the end of his revolution.
4659,building,"when i arrived on campus, only a few people were inside the building."
4660,law,"later, khomeini's book of sufi poems, which he had dedicated to his daughter-in-law, would be published."
4661,death,"in death there was a need to humanize him, an act he had opposed during his life."
4662,law,"and there was, in fact, a human side to him, one that we seldom saw, in his regard for his beautiful  reading lolita in tehran  young daughter-in-law, in whose notebooks he had written his last poems."
4663,fugitive,"i bought a copy of the slim volume and carried it with me to america, along with the leaflets, relics from a time whose reality seems so fragile at times that i need such hard evidence to prove its fugitive existence."
4664,death,i am not good with dates and figures-i had to double-check the date of khomeini's death-but i remember feelings and images.
4665,transferred,"at dawn on monday, ayatollah khomeini's body was transferred from his residence in jamaran, in tehran, to a vast wasteland in the hills to the north, an area known as mosalla, designated as a place of prayer."
4666,case,"khomeini lay in an air-conditioned glass case covered in a white shroud, his feet pointing towards mecca."
4667,death,we gave people more rank and space in death than in life.
4668,war,"then there were the martyrs of war and revolution, each of whom had his own special space at the graveyard, with artificial flowers and photographs to mark the grave."
4669,death,"dissatisfaction at the time of khomeini's death was so high that at first, the officials had thought of burying him in the night so as to cover the sparse attendance."
4670,case,"and when it was returned a few hours later, inside a metal case, the revolutionary guards and some members of the inner circle forced the people back."
4671,death,khomeini's death carried its own illuminations.
4672,taken,"at the start of the revolution, a rumor had taken root that khomeini's image could be seen in the moon."
4673,war,"what they mourned after a well-timed death-for after the defeat in the war and the disenchantment, all he could do was die-was the death of a dream."
4674,murder,"added to the crimes, to the murders and tortures, we would now face this last indignity-the murder of our dreams."
4675,where,"one was in the preface, where james mentions a famous and oft repeated scene as the ""essence"" of his novel; the other was the scene itself."
4676,freedom,"still, we have the illusion of freedom; therefore don't, like me to-day, be without the memory of that illusion."
4677,case,"i was  reading lolita in tehran  either, at the right time, too stupid or too intelligent to have it, and now i'm a case of reaction against the mistake."
4678,where,"and then there is the ambassadors, i continued, where we find several different kinds of courage, but the most courageous characters here are those with imagination, those who, through their imaginative faculty, can empathize with others."
4679,where,"nima, could you please read the passage where strether describes her-"" 'that is just her difficulty-' "" "" 'that is just her difficulty-, that she doesn't admit surprises."
4680,war,"i thought of him on that stretcher, going down the staircase, passing the now irrelevant photographs of the war, passing by ayatollah khomeini, who even after death was glaring down on the procession with his usual stern and impenetrable gaze and passing his precious slogans about the war: whether we kill or are klled we are victorious!"
4681,power,"the revolution must have meant many things to them-mainly power, and access."
4682,power,"but they were also the usurpers, who had been admitted to the university and given power not because of their own merit or hard work but because of their ideological affiliations."
4683,war,"they repeated the story of another leader of the muslim students' association, one who had died during the war, who claimed to have been sexually aroused by the sight of a white patch of skin peeking out from under a head scarf."
4684,penalty,not even death could erase the memory of that white patch and the penalty the young girl had been made to pay for it.
4685,war,"he had turned himself into a revolutionary, a martyr and a war veteran, but not an individual."
4686,power,"it did not occur to me or to my students and colleagues as we shared stories and anecdotes that day, like conspirators delighting in the setback of a far more powerful adversary, that he who seemingly wielded so much power was in fact the one with the strongest urge to self-destruction."
4687,death,reading lolita in tehran  he who in life had been nothing to me in death had become an obsession.
4688,war,he had gone to the war as a volunteer.
4689,war,"the excitement of the war was gone, and with that, many young revolutionaries had lost their power."
4690,war,this war has been a blessing for us!
4691,war,"for us, it was a war that we never felt quite a part of."
4692,war,"yet for people like him, in a strange way the war must have been a blessing."
4693,power,it gave them a sense of community and purpose and power.
4694,power,"his privilege and power meant nothing to him now, and his fellow islamic students had already moved on."
4695,war,"what must have gone through his mind when he saw that his old comrades were more eager to watch the oscar celebrations, via forbidden satellite dishes, than clips from the war?"
4696,war,"i kept thinking of him coming early to the university with two full cans of gasoline-probably not searched, because he was a privileged war veteran."
4697,war,he had returned from a war where he belonged to a university he had never been a part of.
4698,death,only his moment of death could spark interest.
4699,death,"it was ironic that this man, whose life had been so determined by doctrinal certainty, would now gain so much complexity in death."
4700,where,"nothing was said about him-no commemoration, no flowers or speeches, in a country where funerals and mourning were more magnificently produced than any other national art form."
4701,term,cozy-a word too common for yassi's usage-would be the right term for how we felt.
4702,sentence,how could one read the opening sentence of pride and prejudice and not grasp that this was what austen demanded of her readers?
4703,taken,"looking at her, i thought of her own recent marriage to hamid; their furtive courtship must have taken place right under my unsuspecting nose."
4704,question,"i had asked mitra anxiously, causing manna to say, ""that boring question again."""
4705,question,it was a joke among my friends and colleagues that i could never resist posing my obsessive question to married couples.
4706,taken,"""the islamic republic has taken us back to jane austen's times."
4707,law,i had to argue with a friend-a male friend-that the only way he could convince me this was progressive was if the law gave women the same rights as men.
4708,where,"where does that leave uswhat sort of legacy, i mean?"
4709,sentence,and this was how we started our play on  reading lolita in tehran  austen's famous opening sentence-a temptation that almost every austen reader must have felt at least once.
4710,case,"but in this case, even i was too excited to wait."
4711,sharia,"at the start of the twentieth century, the age of marriage in iran-nine, according to sharia lawswas changed to thirteen and then later to eighteen."
4712,freedom,we all wanted opportunities and freedom.
4713,law,"by the time my daughter was born five years later, the laws had regressed to what they had been before my grandmother's time: the first law to be repealed, months before the ratification of a new constitution, was the family-protection law, which guaranteed women's rights at home and at  reading lolita in tehran  work."
4714,death,"the age of marriage was lowered to nine-eight and a half lunar years, we were told; adultery and prostitution were to be punished by stoning to death; and women, under law, were considered to have half the worth of men."
4715,sharia,sharia law replaced the existing system of jurisprudence and became the norm.
4716,sentenced,"after the revolution, these same two women were sentenced to death for the sins of warring with god and spreading prostitution."
4717,where,"one of them, the minister for women's affairs, had been abroad at the time of revolution and remained in exile, where she became a leading spokesperson for women's rights and human rights."
4718,death,"the other, the minister of education and my former high school principal, was put in a sack and stoned or shot to death."
4719,power,they had tasted power and were not about to give it up without a fight.
4720,war,"interesting, i thought, how war and revolution have made us even more aware of our own personal ordealsespecially marriage, at the heart of which was the question of individual freedom, as jane austen had discovered two centuries before."
4721,guilty,"would her mother, with her martyr's look, make sanaz feel guilty, as if she had failed her on purpose?"
4722,question,"""you'll always be taking a risk when you decide to marry, but the question is, do you love him now?"""
4723,authority,"as part of your homework, i added, and it was one of the rare times i actually enjoyed my authority."
4724,power,"it is daring and beckoning, designed to attract, to pull in, but at the same time it retracts and refracts with a power she loses as soon as she stops dancing."
4725,taken,"it predicts its effect before another little step is taken, and then another little step."
4726,where,"i know as little about where this road leads as alice knew when she first ran after the white rabbit, the one who was wearing a waistcoat and a watch and muttering, ""i'm late, i'm late."""
4727,charged,"at netherfield they meet again, and this time they dance, a dance that, despite its civilized appearance, is charged with tension; his attraction to her increases in direct ratio to her repulsion."
4728,situation,"their desire for privacy and reflection is continually being adjusted to their situation within a very small community, which keeps them under its constant scrutiny."
4729,where,this was where austen's danger lay.
4730,taken,she had taken to polishing them a bright tomato red and appeared totally preoccupied by their shape and color.
4731,imprisonment,"polished nails, like makeup, were a punishable offense, resulting in flogging, fines and up to one year imprisonment."
4732,locked,"mahshid recoiled into her shell, and nassrin leaned forward, her hands locked together in a ferocious grip."
4733,case,"first i recounted them to bijan after dinner, and then i talked to my best friend, a great lawyer with a weakness for lost causes, and convinced her to accept her case."
4734,abuse,we talked about different instances in which the physical and mental abuse of women had been considered insufficient grounds for divorce by the ruling judge.
4735,case,"in our case, the law really was blind; in its mistreatment of women, it knew no religion, race or creed."
4736,political rights,"at the core of the fight for political rights is the desire to protect ourselves, to prevent the political from intruding on our individual lives."
4737,power,"now that the mullahs ruled the land, religion was used as an instrument of power, an ideology."
4738,power,"it was this ideological approach to faith that differentiated those in power from millions of ordinary citizens, believers like mahshid, manna and yassi, who found the islamic republic their worst enemy."
4739,war,"yet even for them, the contradictions and inhibitions in their personal lives involved them more directly than the great matters of war and revolution."
4740,war,"i lived in the islamic republic for eighteen years, yet i did not fully grasp this truth during the first years of upheaval, in the midst of the public executions and bloody demonstrations or over the eight years of war, when the red and white sirens mixed with the sounds of rockets and bombs."
4741,war,"it became clear to me only after the war and after khomeini's death, the two factors that had kept the country forcibly united, preventing the discordant voices and contradictions from surfacing."
4742,where,"you will remind me of the end of the previous section, where the choices for the radical revolutionaries appeared to be either to set fire to themselves or to change with the times."
4743,where,"times of peace often bring to the surface the extent of the damage, placing in the foreground the gaping craters where houses used to be."
4744,notorious,"our president, the powerful former speaker of the house, hojatol-islam rafsanjani, the first to earn the title of reformist, was the new hope, but he who called himself the general of reconstruction and was nicknamed ayatollah gorbachev was notorious for financial and political corruption and for his involvement in terrorizing dissidents both at home and abroad."
4745,arrest,"the result of such moderation was that sanaz and mitra were not afraid to wear their scarves more daringly, show a bit of hair, but the morality police also had the right to arrest them."
4746,jail,"when they reminded the police of the president's words, the revolutionary guards would immediately arrest and jail them, hurling insults against the president, his mother and any other son of a ."
4747,case,"but the president's liberalism, as would later be the case with his successor, president khatami, stopped there."
4748,jailed,"when the dissident writer saidi sirjani, who had the illusion of presidential support, was jailed, tortured and finally murdered, no one came to his assistance-another example of the constant struggle between the islamic republic of words and deeds, one that continues to this day."
4749,power,"hope for some means its loss for others; when the hopeless regain some hope, those in power-the ones who had taken it away-become afraid, more protective of their endangered interests, more repressive."
4750,war,"it was a time of peace, a time for reconstruction, for the ordinary rhyme and rhythm of life to take over again, and instead a cacophony of voices overwhelmed us and came to supersede the somber sounds of war."
4751,war,"the war with iraq had ended, but the government continued its war against internal enemies, against those it considered to be representatives of cultural decadence and western influence."
4752,jail,"political parties and political enemies were in jail and banned, but in the field of culture-literature, music, art and philosophy-the dominant trend was with the secular forces; the islamic elite had failed to gain ascendancy in any of these areas."
4753,pleaded,"he would always love her, he pleaded."
4754,conviction,"he'll change his mind, his father said with conviction; just give him time."
4755,locked,"yassi, who seemed to have suddenly shrunk to her normal size, sat up straight with her hands locked in her lap."
4756,where,"it felt good to know where to put the blame, one of the few compensations of victimhood-""and suffering is another bad habit,"" as bellow had said in herzog."
4757,sentence,"""remember that sentence you were quoting from him-one of the many we have been regaled with in the past two weeks-'first these people murdered you, then they forced you to brood over their crimes.'"
4758,where,"""where have you wandered off to?"""
4759,liberty,"""i was thinking about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, about the fact that my girls are not happy."
4760,freedom,"""but so long as we fail to grasp this, and keep fighting for political freedom without understanding its dependence on individual freedoms, on the fact that your sanaz shouldn't have to go all the way to turkey to be courted, we don't deserve those rights."""
4761,guilty,i felt guilty about my complaints to my magician.
4762,term,"yassi was narrating her latest adventure with a ""gentleman caller""-her term."
4763,where,"her playing of the instrument, her insistence on going to university in tehran, her choosing to come to this class-all were preparations that led her towards her final goal: to be physically where her uncles were and to get a taste of the tantalizing fruit that had always dangled over the lives of her mother and aunts, beckoning and just out of reach."
4764,freedom,"they, the women, had lacked nothing in intelligence and intellect, but they had lacked freedom."
4765,lawyer,my lawyer friend was having a great deal of difficulty in trying to help azin.
4766,law,"ten days later she had come to the lawyer's office with her husband, mother-in-law and sisters-in-law."
4767,taken,"soon after that, she barged in without an appointment; she was all bruised, claimed that he had beaten her again and taken their little girl to his mother's house."
4768,pleading,"then at night he had knelt by her bedside, weeping and pleading with her not to leave him."
4769,custody,"that girl was her whole life, and you know the courts, child custody always went to the father."
4770,question,this was a question i asked myself day and night.
4771,where,"where else in the world, he asked me, would a talk on madame bovary draw such crowds and nearly lead to a riot?"
4772,building,"he created this home, literally building our apartment and our place in the mountains, and established routines like watching the bbc and cooking barbecues for friends."
4773,freedom,"""the ordeal of freedom,"" nassrin said elliptically, echoing my favorite line from bellow."
4774,where,and about yassi and her irrepressible fantasies about that never-never land where her uncles lived.
4775,state,"everything in her present situation offended her, from the fact that she and her husband were still financially dependent on her family to the mediocre state of intellectuals and the everyday cruelties of the islamic regime."
4776,situation,"yet unlike yassi, manna obstinately refused to do anything about her situation."
4777,case,nowhere was this challenge more apparent than in the case of jane austen.
4778,guilty,he tried to tell me that austen was not only anti-islamic but that she was guilty of another sin: she was a colonial writer.
4779,slavery,"he told me that mansfield park was a book that condoned slavery, that even in the west they had now seen the error of their ways."
4780,where,"it was only later, on a trip to the states, that i found out where mr. nahvi was getting his ideas from when i bought a copy of edward said's culture and imperialism."
4781,inside,"inside the envelope, mitra had found a one-page letter, with the same dreadful color and smell, written in immaculate handwriting, in black ink."
4782,power,"nothing-no power-had ever done to him what her smile, which he hoped was for him and him alone, could do."
4783,taken,"all this had taken place in the middle of mitra and hamid's highly secretive courtship, sanaz reminded us."
4784,death,"""like the shadow of death,"" nassrin ominously interjected."
4785,inside,"inside he had written, to my bashful rose."
4786,power,"and, well, he reproduced a poem that you used to teach in your introduction to literature class: somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond any experience,your eyes have their silence: in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, or which i cannot touch because they are too near your slightest look easily will unclose me  reading lolita in tehran  though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as spring opens (touching skilfully,mysteriously) her first rose or if your wish be to close me,i and my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly, as when the heart of this flower imagines the snow carefully everywhere descending; nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals the power of your intense fragility:whose texture compels me with the colour of its countries, rendering death and forever with each breathing (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens;only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands it's enough to put you off teaching poetry, i said, infected by their girlish mood."
4787,where,"i felt at the time that she was overly ambitious, and that she used me and people like me to get where she wanted to go."
4788,power,"she yearned to become a literary personage: her love of literature was real, yet her talents were limited and her ambition for power and control sometimes surpassed and even came to clash with that love."
4789,law,"in the late summer of 1990, for the first time in eleven years, my family and i left for cyprus for a vacation and to meet up with my sisters-in-law, who had never seen our children."
4790,where,"she asked what i had done there, where i had gone."
4791,where,"one day, they went to the beach where we had gone swimming."
4792,where,"she hesitated about putting on a swimsuit, and when she did, she wanted to go to a deserted part of the beach, where no one could see her."
4793,taken,her intrusions now have taken a different form.
4794,taken,"that day, she had come to class later than usual and had casually taken off her coat, revealing a light blue shirt, a navy jacket and jeans."
4795,where,"he had been out with many girls, and when i went to oklahoma with him, where he went to college, his friends were surprised, because right up to the day he returned to iran for the summer, he had been living with an american girl he had introduced to everyone as his wife."
4796,wall,"there was a long pause during which i picked up the vase and pushed it to the side, next to the wall."

4804,illegal,how could it be experienced if its expression was illegal?
4805,pleading,"it's hard on me, i grumbled, pleading with some unknown interlocutor, who always questioned and mocked my every complaint."
4806,guilty,"it's really hard on me, i repeated one more time, ignoring the guilty knowledge that bijan bore his hardships without much complaint and should not be begrudged his vodka and his bbc."
4807,question,"by the time i added the salt and pepper to my dish, i had come up with an answer to this question."
4808,sentence,"i had not seen pride and prejudice till i read that sentence of yours, and then i got the book."
4809,term,"darcy seldom if ever addresses elizabeth by her name, but he has a special way of saying ""you"" when he addresses her a few times that makes the impersonal pronoun a term of ultimate intimacy."
4810,where,"one should appreciate such nuances in a culture such as ours, where everyone is encouraged to demonstrate in the most exaggerated manner his love for the imam and yet forbidden from any public articulation of private feelings, especially love."
4811,where,"elizabeth and darcy are placed near each other in several scenes, but in public places where they cannot communicate privately."
4812,state,the whole event is spent in a state of anxiety.
4813,institution,"it is obvious that she is more interested in happiness than in the institution of marriage, in love and understanding than matrimony."

4817,arrest,"this incident was preceded by many others: the attack on a small party given by a german consul at his house for intellectuals and writers, and their arrest; the disappearance of a well-known leftist journalist, the editor of a popular magazine who had been arrested with others and kept after they were released."

5750,imprisoned,"her neighbours’ houses had gable roofs, but her path would be so blocked that she would be imprisoned in her room, and then she would contract the disease that is said to have come from japan; she would vomit so much that her body would be drained, and rot away all alone, without a nurse, in her room: die and rot away."
5751,death,of course she wasn’t scared of death.
5752,death,"freewheeling guys aren’t scared of death, are they?"
5753,death,"she was scared of the snow and disease and loneliness and closed doors and the sulking of her son-in-law; but she wasn’t scared of death, provided that she wouldn’t suffer any pain, that is; provided that she wouldn’t notice that she was dying; provided that she died in her sleep."
5754,where,"heaven knew where in hell all those children had come from and poured into the alley, throwing snowballs  and sliding on the ice and making slippery the passage of pedestrians."
5755,death,"may your mother perish in sorrow, may i receive the news of your death, may you never have peace in your life: you who have separated my child from me!"
5756,where,"robabeh, where are you to see how ruined and abject has your mother become?"
5757,where,"you godforsaken demons of kids, you have thousands of relatives when someone utters a word to you; but where are your relatives now …?’ a few passers-by approached her."
5758,law,suddenly she thought that the young man was the son-in-law she had always wished to have but never did have; that the woman was her own daughter.
5759,sharia,"a whole week of staying in bed in the mornings, a whole week of playing in the alleys with a thousand and one male and female cousins; a whole week without the fear of seeing mrs superintendent or running into the bad-tempered maths teacher or reciting the sharia book or writing homework; one whole week without memorising a long meaningless poem, or practicing calligraphy with a cane pen and black ink; released from the claws of the school and the lessons; seven days of freedom and playing!"
5760,roads,how much fun was it when we had guests at home and the snow blocked the roads and all those who were in our house had to stay for two or three nights.
5761,taken,"from the very beginning, he had taken off his military uniform, replaced it with a women’s apron and stayed home."
5762,awaiting,"she frequently runs to the middle of the street, restlessly awaiting the line 70 bus."
5763,wall,"everywhere has turned completely white, and hassan aqa is standing by the wall like a blurred ghost."
5764,where,"i’m the only one who knows where his money is, but i don’t touch it."
5765,where,"hassan aqa goes to the rear of the bus where it’s warmer, and is fast asleep almost as he sits down."
5766,awaiting,"mother smells of the days to come, the smell of tomorrow and all the good things that are awaiting me."
5767,hole,"he stops the bus, shoves a piece of newspaper and some old cloth into the hole and sits behind the wheel again."
5768,question,but she doesn’t like my question and angrily threatens to skin me alive if i look at bus drivers or speak to them.
5769,taken,"apprehensively, mother calls dr kowsari and i hear father’s voice ordering to have me prepared to be taken abroad."
5770,where,"my cousins keep murmuring, and grandma hits their feet with a long twig from where she is lying."
5771,imprisoned,"i’ve been imprisoned in the room since i fell ill, and everything scares me."
5772,where,"from where he’s standing, aziz aqa greets me with a nod of his head."
5773,inside,it was jam-packed – eyebrow pencil and lipstick and comb and hairpin and paper sheets and bills and keys and several lottery tickets and cigarette tobacco were all jumbled up inside.
5774,inside,she put her train ticket in the pocket of the bag and put the lottery cards in order and slid them inside the pages of the magazine.
5775,inside,"it was warm inside the compartment, cold and silent outside."
5776,inside,a few people opened the compartment door and peered inside and then closed the door and left.
5777,where,"my older son – he’s in germany now – he’s fifteen …’ mahmoud interrupted her and said shyly, ‘he’s seventeen.’ parvin looked at her husband with daggers in her eyes and said, ‘what?’ then, without waiting for a reply, she said, ‘where was i?"
5778,inside,"in one of the compartments, a woman in a chador was sitting near the door with her milk-filled breast inside a baby’s mouth."
5779,toilet,the toilet was dirty and stinking.
5780,where,"she asked someone, ‘excuse me, mister, where’s the restaurant?’ the man pointed his hand in the opposite direction she was heading and said, ‘at the other end of the train.’ rezvan walked back all the way she had come."
5781,charged,"she asked parvin khanom, ‘have we already passed ahvaz?’ parvin hurriedly swallowed the orange that was in her mouth and said, ‘it’s six; we’ve passed andimeshk too.’ then with a tone more charged with adventure than affection, she asked, ‘did you want to get off?’ rezvan said, ‘no – i’m going to tehran."
5782,wall,"rays from the train’s light pierced a mere step into the dark and beyond that, a black wall stood against it."
5783,inside,it was too warm inside the compartment.
5784,law,"figures and faces were dashing rapidly through her mind: the faces of her daughter and her son and her son-in-law, her neighbours, her relatives, parvin, mahmoud, the boy’s face, the boy’s young face."
5785,where,then he bent over and kissed her where her neck joined the shoulder and caressed her hair.
5786,where,where’s this place?’ the young boy’s hair tickled rezvan’s face.
5787,where,"we’ve still got a long way to go.’ the first voice persisted, ‘where are we now?’ there were footsteps in the corridor and someone said, ‘dorood, we’re in dorood.’ several doors opened and closed and several shouts rose from inside and outside the train."
5788,inside,it seemed to her that the bed was rolling inside the tunnels and passing through them independent of the train.
5789,sentence,we’ll be in araak in ten minutes.’ and the sentence was repeated several times like an echo until it reached the end of the corridor.
5790,wall,rezvan yawned and turned to the wall.
5791,war,there was war and fear and darkness.
5792,war,massoud d. hated the war and was scared of death.
5793,death,"he had to leave, he had to escape and reside somewhere safe, somewhere far away from bustle and bombs and explosions, far away from the possibility of death … he prepared everything furtively and in a flash."
5794,war,"out of pain and desperation, his bowels twisted so terribly that for a moment he forgot about the war and death and decided to stay."
5795,wall,"she had kept sitting by the wall in a corner, on the large tabriz carpet – a relic of her ancestors – pitifully running her hand over its velvet flowers and gold-coloured figures: a residue of bygone days."
5796,inside,"she had kept sitting in a corner, quiet and invisible, full of wounds inside, witnessing the departure of the clock and the table and chairs and china plates and golden frames: like the sad journey of the children of an elderly mother to alien towns."
5797,awaiting,she had realised that hard times were awaiting her and she had accepted it.
5798,transferred,she had transferred her house deeds to him several years ago.
5799,war,"they had agreed not to sell the house before her death, but it was an old pact, belonging to those times, before the revolution and the war, before fear and trembling and the vagrancy of the kids."
5800,war,"however, amid the apprehension and chaos, amid the war and bombardments and the possibility of death, he had lost his mind and was no more responsible for his deeds and demands."
5801,wall,"her memories wandered in the rooms like thousands of images scattered in the air, and the footprints and fingerprints of her childhood remained on the cobblestones of the courtyard and the bricks of the wall."
5802,awaiting,she was awaiting the future; she was waiting for spring and summer.
5803,where,"and now, without a status and a place, she didn’t know on which moment of time she had fallen: who was she, where was she and what should she do."
5804,death,death was at a distance from her.
5805,law,"her english son-in-law was a kind man too, and he was ready to accommodate his mother-in-law."
5806,law,he searched his wife’s handbag or his sister-in-law’s suitcase.
5807,where,he hid away his worthless collection of junk and forgot where he had put things.
5808,taken,he was sure that mahin banoo had taken his glasses and lighter.
5809,law,"even the day when her finger was stuck in the door and her fingernail was torn out, or the night when her brother-in-law disturbed her bed and searched her pockets in search of his agate ring, she neither moaned nor objected nor complained."
5810,law,"notwithstanding all that, if she had been left to herself she would have liked to spend the whole day talking and kissing her grandchildren and son and daughter-in-law, to walk in that mouse-hole of a flat, and excited and agitated, ask them a thousand irrelevant questions."
5811,guilt,"she felt as though a weight of iron was on her chest, and an intruding unknown feeling, a kind of shame and humiliation and guilt circulated in her body."
5812,inside,"she remembered the upset look on her grandchildren’s faces, and the thought that she had usurped their room agitated and disturbed her; it was as though someone poked her, as if needles had been planted inside her mattress and pillow."
5813,wall,"she would rather have slept behind the door in the corridor or squatted in the corner of a chair by the wall, than occupy someone else’s place."
5814,where,where?
5815,law,"it was impossible to sleep in the couple’s bedroom, although her son had insisted and her kind daughter-in-law had no objection either."
5816,law,it was the worst night in mahin banoo’s life; she was so ashamed in front of her daughter-in-law.
5817,law,"her daughter-in-law was tolerant for three or four nights, but then she calmly informed her husband that it was not appropriate to carry on like that."
5818,where,"she sat on the chair in the corridor and waited; waiting for her heartbeat to subside, for her thoughts to come to order so that she would see where she could go."
5819,war,she ate her meal with eagerness and she remembered nanneh khanom bringing the dinner tray for her – in those days she was someone: she had authority – and how she felt pity and how she cried when she heard that nanneh khanom’s grandson had been martyred in the war and her son had been taken to the lunatic asylum.
5820,taken,"and nanneh khanom was taken back to her village, given a room and a monthly pension."
5821,law,her son-in-law also kissed her and squeezed her hand hard.
5822,law,"she had wished to have a moslem, iranian son-in-law."
5823,law,"she held his manly arm, laughed, and she only just then realised how frail and little she was; her head stood lower than her son-in-law’s waistline; she was like a chicken, no more than forty kilos – maybe less – with hollow bones and legs as narrow as pencils."
5824,law,"david oakley lifted his mother-in-law, who was as light as a feather, and mahin banoo screamed, became erect and stiff like a pencil, and remained that way."
5825,law,david oakley was in a good mood: he was holding his mother-in-law like a wooden doll under his arm and walking up the stairs.
5826,situation,she didn’t have a natural reaction or a ready response to accept or reject the situation; she thought that she wasn’t herself.
5827,law,"she didn’t understand her son-in-law’s language, and maggie had to speak with her husband in english or not speak at all."
5828,wall,"worse than all was the sound of her coughing, which prevented the next-door neighbour from sleeping; he banged his fist on the wall and mahin banoo hid her head under the pillow."
5829,law,david oakley took three days off and took her wife and mother-in-law for sightseeing and recreation.
5830,law,"and during those two months they rented out the house to help with the expenses: it was understandable, particularly since the mother-in-law had brought extra expenses with her and they needed some extra income."
5831,hole,"although they tried to talk in whispers and speak quietly, mahin banoo could hear their talks and arguments, and pressed the tip of her toes to the ground so that maybe a hole would open up and swallow her."
5832,where,"she asked herself what had attached her so much to life, and where on earth her strength came from."
5833,state,"he heard, through word of mouth, about the jarring state of his sister, and he blew his top."
5834,ordered,he ordered them to arrange for his sister’s move.
5835,inside,"she felt that a thousand tiny stars were twinkling in between her thoughts, and a lamp was lit inside of her."
5836,where,"all through the journey, in fever and drenched in sweat but joyful, she was sitting by the window and she was so intoxicated and fascinated by what was outside that she couldn’t remember where she was or who she was."
5837,power,"a woman raised to the power of infinity, women tied to each other in a chain of eternal return."
5838,awaiting,karim khan was impatiently awaiting her sister’s arrival.
5839,state,he telephoned her children and told them about their mother’s state.
5840,where,he was excited and overwhelmed with joy and he had so much to say he didn’t know where to begin.
5841,where,she couldn’t remember where she was.
5842,death,she listened: there were no sounds but the silence of the falling snow and the sweet quiet of death.
5843,guilty,massoud d. blamed his sister and considered her guilty.
5844,law,"david oakley said that such events happened all the time, and since he taught at the university, he spoke of the law of cause and effect and the rules of history and economy."
5845,war,"with all those problems and all that misery and work and fatigue, amid war and exile, how was it possible to retain one’s memory?"
5846,gate,"our house was at the end of the alley, and a little farther, the alley came to a dead-end at a large, wide gate."
5847,gate,"through the planks of the gate, which were decked with spikes, one could look at a vast garden, which the residents of the alley called the ‘alley-end garden’."
5848,gate,"during the days, other kids and i drew hopscotch grids in front of the garden’s gate, played with pebbles and rope-danced."
5849,wall,"but when the games ended and the kids went home, i climbed to the rooftop through stairs in the house’s porch and adjacent to the garden’s wall, and furtively watched the garden."
5850,gate,"the garden was rectangular and vast; from its gate stretched a narrow street paved with gravel, beyond it there were orderly furrows of vegetables framed by rows of blue cabbage."
5851,gate,"the garden’s trees were acquainted with me; i had divided them into families: opposite the garden gate was a thick old plane that would be grandfather to all the others, and then in the row of poplars there was a family with three kids: two tall and lean trees that easily swung – these would be the sons – and a shorter, bushier one that would make the little daughter."
5852,wall,"there were also a few elms at the eastern end of the wall; single and without mates, with a dark green hue; they all looked to me like the old maid who lived a few houses down from ours and was on fighting terms with everyone save the kids."
5853,awaiting,"if i heard the bells from far off i would distinguish whether the mules were loaded or not, coming or going, and if i didn’t go up to the rooftop every day it was as if i had lost something; i imagined that an unknown being was awaiting me in the garden, and this was not an irrelevant conjecture, for when i had enough of watching the garden and wanted to go down my glance was for no reason drawn to the western end."
5854,killing,"and killing a snake – moslem or infidel – brings bad luck; that’s why the barn is abandoned.’ some of the women said that on summer afternoons they had seen the snake twisting its wide body with its blotches and markings on the wet soil under the mulberry tree, sticking out its forked red tongue, panting and searching for water."
5855,wall,"we spread a kilim on the rooftop next to the wall, sprinkled water on rashti straw mats and spread them under the bedrolls and brought the samovar onto the rooftop."
5856,where,"i liked to sit down and watch the inside of the crystal hookah’s water container, where she used to put a few red rose or damascus rose petals."
5857,hole,"when there was not much water in the container sometimes a narrow strip of smoke came out of the pipe’s hole and crawled in the space above the water surface and the dolls remained dazzled and motionless and i saw the ghoul of grandmother’s stories growling through the hole in the hookah’s neck, searching for the wooden dolls to swallow them in one go."
5858,crime,"sometimes i recited the poem on the death of nassereddin shah, which i had learned from grandmother: nassereddin, the just king and prime minister of the land went on pilgrimage friday ladies of the harem became homeless children of the harem became fatherless less … less … less … in time with the refrain i first clapped and next time hit my knees with my hands, and i remember that instead of ‘prime minister’ i used to say ‘crime sinister’ without paying attention to the meaning of the poem."
5859,gate,"the day was another world, with much gambolling and a multitude of games; we drew grids with charcoal on the ground before the garden gate at the end of the alley, and our entire time was spent playing hopscotch and giving piggy-back rides to the winners, and how much humiliation we suffered when neighbours wiped off our black grid with their feet."
5860,law,"i’ve never seen anyone mourn so long for a son-in-law.’ at that time i couldn’t properly understand the meaning of such remarks, but based on all that i’d seen, i found a new feeling in me, and maybe it was the first time that i seriously thought of my father."
5861,where,"they picked the stone up from near my foot, yelling, ‘you failed in square four, so you must give someone else a piggy-back four times, you failed …’ for a while, i stood where i was, transfixed: so my father hasn’t gone on a trip, he’s dead, now i’m an orphan … i looked at the kids."
5862,where,"but then i asked myself, ‘where’s he gone then?’ i didn’t dare ask grandmother."
5863,wall,"sometimes she put them in couples between the lamp and the wall and moved them with a string, and their shadow on the wall became my little cinema."
5864,gang,she had named the paper dolls ‘the plum gang’.
5865,gang,the dolls of the plum gang were real and dear to me; i would cry if one of them was torn apart.
5866,wall,"i pledged not to use the chain of the water bowls of saqqakhaneh as a swing any more; i pledged to pick up bread crumbs from the pavement, kiss them and put them beside the wall so that noone would step on them."
5867,wall,"my father’s portrait, which used to hang on the wall in the dining room, was put on the mantle in the corner room."
5868,question,her heartbeat thumped against my cheek; i was waiting all over and i regretted having asked that question.
5869,where,she took a look at me from the corner of her eye; i was about to jump into her arms but she bit her lip and i was electrocuted where i was standing.
5870,where,for a moment i didn’t know where i was.
5871,chain,"the sound of beetles and crickets had surrounded me with a sharp, uninterrupted chain."
5872,gang,"my body was one-dimensional and made of paper, like the dolls of the plum gang."
5873,inside,for a moment i closed my eyes and plunged into the darkness inside me; there was nothing.
5874,wall,"i had gone round the corner when i saw their shadows on the wall, the shadows of tens of clusters that had been cast on the wall."
5875,wall,"the koran reader was standing under the taffeta of the tomb’s entrance and when i was passing him, i saw that he was looking at something between me and the wall, and his left hand was resting on the wall, and in his right hand he was holding the koran; i had seen the waiting look in his eyes."
5876,gate,"by the time i reached the cemetery gate, i was fed up with the muddy and heavy chador."
5877,wall,"and the point is that, whatever it was, it was by this very wall."
5878,situation,"hours before that, there was a situation that made me flee home."
5879,wall,"when i went round the corner, i saw him standing by this very wall."
5880,wall,i was wondering if i could hit him hard against the wall and go past him.
5881,wall,in my brain i had put my thoughts in order; but he was sitting right in the middle of the alley and his hands were touching the wall on the two sides.
5882,stretch,"‘what’s the use?’ this i had said, and he had replied, ‘we can go just straight on until we get to the wide stretch.’ i could only see the lights of the bus station at the end of the alley."
5883,wall,"i pressed myself against the wall; now the shadow was behind me and my heart pounded like a headless chicken, and our bodies were about to become one for a long moment; and our glances were intertwined."
5884,state,at the bottom of his eyes there was something that you could say was a state between crying and a feeling like regret.
5885,where,"i was squirming where i sat, watching from the corner of my eye the people who were staring at me in shyness and perplexity."
5886,where,"it was then that i noticed that i had no shadow, and that was why the shy, silent and kind people in the bus station were looking at me like that; the people whom i thought would welcome me easily among themselves, and we would set out together from the same station and in the same bus and go to a place where there was only light and grass."
5887,inside,"my whole body was boiling and sizzling from inside; but like when it’s cold, there was also numbness, and besides all these things, i had been sitting in a manner that any passerby could suppose that i was quite comfortable."
5888,wall,"i mean, she wasn’t sitting, for her shadow wasn’t on the wall."
5889,wall,"looking from the outside, the shadows of mother and dayeh khanom were cast on the wall; their heads were elongated and when they turned into silhouettes, you could see the intangible movements of their lips."
5890,death,maybe they were reciting the prayer for precarious death.
5891,death,"mother said, ‘it’s a year that she’s been in death agony; what reprise is she being punished for?’ i didn’t know."
5892,death,i’m ashamed of myself.’ during all that time when she had been in death agony – and it was months – i either walked under the trees or walked in my room.
5893,wall,"the room had a mirror and a chandelier and whenever i walked in the room, the colourful hues of the chandelier were on the opposite wall, and from there they were reflected in the mirror."
5894,wall,"the koran reader was reciting, and i was in the corner of the tomb, and during the entire time that my back was against the wall, the rain was falling."
5895,wall,"when light reaches them, it refracts and casts their shadows on the wall; on the contrary, the crystal pendants let light through easily and light becomes something among seven colours – so that they’ll perfect illusion in you; so that you’ll always be horrified."
5896,where,"the water is supposed to be imported from karbala, where shiite third imam hussein is buried."
5897,where,i knew where he was.
5898,insane,it was just last year when my man went insane.
5899,where,but where to?
5900,where,eventually we would find a place where we could find a loaf of bread to eat.
5901,inside,i went inside meaty esmail’s house to say goodbye to his wife.
5902,insane,"since that time my husband went insane and we stayed here; stayed by the hamoun so that one day, maybe one day the hamoun would be filled up again."
5903,where,"hamoun is a lake in the same region, where the river hirmand, originating from afghanistan, ends."
5904,punishment,identical punishment for non-identical sins; or perhaps for unequal sins.
5905,wall,"wounded by her indifference and frigidity, he was leaning against the corner of the wall, looking out into the alley through the lace curtain."
5906,imprisoned,the pounding ‘tom-tom’ of the midnight drums of those remote years and the cries of hidden scandals are still imprisoned behind her eardrums.
5907,death,"with a poison-clogged throat, she keeps waiting – a black waiting, contaminated with hatred and a longing for the man’s death."
5908,where,"i want to tell her, even assuming that mom could take us with her, where was she supposed to take us?"
5909,state,i felt i couldn’t work in that state; i took some bread and cheese and went into the room.
5910,where,"the boom of the sea is deafening, as if it wants to come in, reach out its blue hands and pick grandmother up and take her with it, take her where it keeps the fishermen."
5911,detained,"she said, ‘maybe they’ve detained him, maybe they’ve put chains on him.’ picking the henna left at the bottom of the cauldron and putting it on her hair, mansour’s mother said, ‘there’s no use thinking, madineh."
5912,where,"‘now she’ll be alright.’ ‘go to sleep, kid!’ grandmother’s voice is cheerful and the wind takes the murmuring of the village’s women to the bottom of the sea, where the blue ones dwell."
5913,guilty,"we can hear their voices: ‘madineh, what the devil should we do if the men don’t come back?’ ‘the blue ones don’t drown anybody; it’s the red ones that are nasty.’ ‘by god, if my mansour doesn’t return, i’ll hold every blue one guilty …’ ‘shhh, they’ll hear and take it to heart.’ the men aren’t back."
5914,sink,"the blue ones are nice and kind, but if they curse, a thousand ships will sink."
5915,taken,"bubuni said, ‘with all these amulets we can bring back all the men.’ grandmother says, ‘now that she’s taken away the amulets, the fishermen must appear by sunset.’ ‘grandmother, but there’s no fire in the water!’ she turns and looks at me."
5916,where,"‘why does she drive the moon crazy if she doesn’t want it?’ ‘she wants the moon to show her a place.’ ‘what place?’ ‘the alley where the house of the fisherman was …’ ‘doesn’t she know herself?’ ‘no, she’s lost the alley.’ ‘do you know where it is?’ ‘yes.’ ‘then tell her.’ ‘it’s useless; the fisherman has gone to a faraway place; and a mermaid can’t get too far from the sea.’ ‘grandmother, why did the fisherman leave?’ ‘nobody knows."
5917,insane,"grandmother’s voice is scared: ‘now she’s going insane.’ bubuni says, ‘our men won’t come back any more … our men.’ the voice of mansour’s mother echoes in the village."
5918,taken,"she’s gone.’ ‘our men, madineh, our men!’  3 mansour’s mother said, ‘the drums, the drums.’ ‘she won’t come back any more; she’ll just die there; she’d become so thin …’ golpar’s mother has taken her black clothes out of the chest; she still doesn’t know whether to put them on or not."
5919,where,"‘where’s grandfather now?’ ‘god knows.’ ‘is he fishing?’ ‘no, any kind of fishing would have been over by now.’ ‘where is he then?’ she doesn’t reply; she doesn’t say where he is; but i know: if the mermaid curses someone, all will go to the bottom of the sea, where it’s full of corals and starfish; they’ll stay right there in the water, sit in the mermaids’ houses and be sad."
5920,where,i wish the mermaid died … where’s my grandfather?
5921,sink,"if the mermaids heave at the sea, we’ll all sink underwater, and we’ll become food for fish right there …’ she’s still begging."
5922,where,where’s she going?
5923,where,where’s she taking her?
5924,where,where’s she?
5925,where,where’s she …?’ ‘come give a hand.
5926,case,"and in that case, you’re already finished.’ he laughed."
5927,where,i didn’t know where his home was or even what his name was; i was always afraid of knowing his name.
5928,where,"‘where’s your home?’ ‘far away, too far away.’ i asked him once and never again!"
5929,tortured,"i was afraid to ask, just as i was afraid to look at him; anxiety tortured me and i said to myself: what if there’s no home at all?"

6307,case,"“don’t aggravate your case!” they obey, sit in silence."
6308,locked,"isaac rises to his feet but his knees, locked into place like rusted doorknobs, make him fall back on the bench."
6309,building,he is led out of the building and onto the street.
6310,executed,"he thinks of his friend kourosh nassiri, whose name he had seen in the newspaper’s daily list of the executed one morning as he sipped his tea."
6311,death,"kourosh’s death had made him realize that executions were no longer reserved for the shah’s friends, generals, or hench-  9  dalia sofer  men; anyone was now eligible, anyone who was not liked or no longer fit in."
6312,where,but where would he have gone?
6313,sentences,"save us because of your mercy.” when he is done he whispers “amen,” and is surprised that a few sentences—a mere assembly of words—could fill him with such stillness, even if only for the seconds it took him to say them."
6314,inside,“there is a small step.” inside a hand reaches behind his head and unties the handkerchief.
6315,burglar,when isaac opens his eyes he sees a man wearing a black burglar’s mask.
6316,where,"mohsen leads him down a flight of stairs into a cement basement with no windows, where the air stands heavy, pregnant with the perspiration of the men who breathed it before him."
6317,inside,"am i being accused of something?” mohsen’s eyes narrow inside the mask’s cradle, tiny wrinkles forming on the outer edges."
6318,killing,"he walks to the door, opens it, and sticking his head out yells, “hossein-agha, bring me some tea, will you?” as he walks back toward isaac he mumbles, “this headache is killing me.” this intimate confession by his interrogator calms isaac."
6319,sink,"the night the first one chipped, farnaz stood still by the sink, water running over her hands."
6320,cell,“brother hossein will take you to your cell.” mohsen disappears and the man who brought in the tea earlier returns.
6321,where,"in the dim hallway isaac looks down at his wrist, at the empty spot where his watch used to be."
6322,cell,"it means nothing here.”  16  t wo  he guard, hossein, stands by the door of the cell, holding a candle to allow isaac to settle in."
6323,toilet,"the fullness in his bladder makes him wonder how many hours separate him from dawn, which most likely will be accompanied by  t  dalia sofer  a visit to the toilet."
6324,cellmate,"his cellmate must have made it to his mattress, which is adjacent to isaac’s and across from the boy’s."
6325,situation,"how long have you been in here?” “close to eight months now.” “the situation is the same,” he says."
6326,cell,someone in the neighboring cell clears his throat every thirty seconds or so.
6327,crime,"what is your crime?” “i don’t know yet,” isaac says."
6328,wall,"he lies awake, notices a shoebox window high up on the  wall, a sapphire sky wrapped around its black bars."
6329,cell,"the glass is broken, allowing a warm breeze to enter the cell."
6330,locked,"he tries to sleep but cannot, sees fickle shapes in bright colors, the same kaleidoscopic monsters that would visit him in the dark as a boy, when the voice of his drunken father and the faint whines of his mother would reach him through the locked door of his bedroom."
6331,where,"19  thr ee  n the dark farnaz traces the outlines of the furniture— the curving bedpost where isaac’s striped pajama pants still hang, the half-moon of the alabaster table lamp by her bed, and the sandalwood buddha, arms stretched toward the sky, a lotus blossom in his hands."
6332,taken,"“apparently picasso had specified in his will that the  i  the septembers of shiraz  painting could only be taken back to spain once the country became a republic.” “well, it’s not a republic,” he said."
6333,arrest,"since yesterday’s call from isaac’s brother, javad, who had heard about the arrest from a friend who had joined the revolutionary guards, the phone has not rung once."
6334,executed,"she thinks of kourosh nassiri, how she had seen his name among the list of executed in the paper."
6335,execution,they never spoke of kourosh nassiri’s execution again.
6336,pleading,"the day their gardener abbas brought  21  dalia sofer  her in, pleading that they adopt her, farnaz had resisted the idea."
6337,wall,"on the opposite wall, trees peering over the terrace make swaying shadows that most nights manage to put her to sleep."
6338,inside,"she goes back inside, makes her way down the stairs and out to the garden."
6339,inside,"feeling a chill settling in her thighs, she goes back in, to her quiet house, which suddenly seems unnecessarily vast—the white limestone facade, the lanterns illuminating the garden path, the shimmering blue of the pool, all posing as elaborate gatekeepers to the unraveling inside."
6340,where,"23  dalia sofer  “yes?” habibeh looks at the bed, at the unruffled side, where isaac should have been."
6341,where,"they got him.” she pushes back the comforter, brings her feet to the floor and stares at them, her toenails painted a pinkish white—like seashells—reminding her of promenades along the beach, where they had been, just weeks ago."
6342,where,where is he now?” “don’t think about that now.” habibeh walks to the windows and pulls open the curtains.
6343,illegal,"not only is it bad for you, it’s illegal now.” she puts the glass back down and leaves."
6344,illegal,illegal?
6345,law,but when did habibeh become so law-abiding?
6346,gate,"she stands by the iron gate, tea in hand, watching the day unfold—pedestrians walking hurriedly past, cars honking to salvage lost minutes, children bearing the anxious look of the first weeks of school, their backs hunched under massive book bags."
6347,war,"the war with iraq, already a year old, has made the most mundane items—eggs, cheese, soap—worthy of celebration."
6348,gate,"“yes, sister?” a young man at the gate walks toward her."
6349,clink,"summer is leaving, and with it the buzz of ceiling fans, the smell of wet dust rising through air-conditioning vents, the clink of noontime dishes heard through open windows, the chatter of families passing long, muggy afternoons in courtyards, eating pumpkin seeds and watermelon."
6350,interrogation,"show us the straight path.” during the morning prayer mehdi, who occasionally prays at the mosque to ingratiate himself to his captors, had shown him all the movements, but afterward he had been taken for interrogation and has not returned."
6351,cellmate,isaac tries to remember his cellmate’s lesson; the whole thing is like the memory of a dream trying to surface.
6352,guard,“what’s all this talk?” a guard yells from behind.
6353,situation,"like mehdi, he had hoped  29  dalia sofer  that attending would improve his situation, regardless of his religion."
6354,cell,it isn’t that simple.” “then go back to your cell!
6355,guard,this incident will be added to your file.” another guard takes hold of isaac’s arm and drags him across the desolate courtyard.
6356,inside,"isaac pictures the men inside the mosque, down on all fours facing mecca, bodies bowing to the floor and rising again, prayers forming underneath their breaths."
6357,cell,when they reach his cell he asks for an aspirin and the guard agrees to bring him one.
6358,where,"the sour scent of blood reaches him from across the room, where mehdi’s soiled bandages are piled up."
6359,wall,"he turns on his side, faces the wall, where someone has inscribed, “i have a bad feeling today."
6360,where,"every morning he would put on his trousers and starched white shirt, slip his feet into the leather oxfords that had made their way from the trash of the well-to-do villas of southern abadan to the closets of the modest khorramshahr port where he lived, and hop on the bicycle that would take him six miles south, to the center of the city where the refinery gurgled."
6361,ordered,"he sat at his regular table by the window overlooking a row of old houses, but instead of his regular tea he ordered a shot of arrack."
6362,ordered,"he felt fluid as he  31  dalia sofer  drank it, the chipping teal-colored walls spinning in slow motion, so he ordered another, then a third."
6363,escaped,"when the lyrics escaped him he simulated the sinuous sound of a trumpet, and the girl sang along, her mellow voice curving against the walls of sleepy homes and reverberating in the dark."
6364,prisoner,"he held the swelling between his legs like a prisoner, wished he could release it."
6365,war,"she was doing good, was helping the global force against the reich, and he, by putting on his clothes as quickly as possible and vanishing from her quarters, would be doing his bit for the war effort too."
6366,hole,"he cared less about leaving without it than about her finding it, the hole at the toe howling in daylight."
6367,guard,"“here,” the guard says."
6368,where,"“an aspirin.” isaac turns around,  stretches out his arm to take the pill, and seeing the guard in his black mask standing over him, he remembers where he is."
6369,where,"as soon as the garage gates would rattle open and the determined sound of his father’s car would fill the morning, he would leave his own bed and go to hers, where he would find her warm body, still filled with sleep."
6370,inside,"inside the apartment he unfolds the letter, reads it again—this time slowly: “september 8, 1981."
6371,where,"to enter their apartment would  41  dalia sofer  be like relegating himself to a ghetto, where the memories of all the wrongs committed against jews simmer year after year in bulky, indigestible stews."
6372,where,"outside the air is clean, cleaner than in his basement apartment where humidity swells like steam in a ship’s engine room."
6373,inside,"“may you be happy, my parviz,” his father had said, his right eye infected, the veins like rivulets spilling red inside it."
6374,gate,just take care of yourself.”  44  the septembers of shiraz  hugging his father by the gate parviz felt for the first time a slight curvature in his father’s shoulders.
6375,war,"“they’ve sent you off because of the war, yes?” an old woman sitting next to him said."
6376,war,"the war, the draft, the revolution—all of it."
6377,inside,"as the plane finally took off, he watched the city move farther and farther from him—the houses enclosed inside brick courtyards, the miniature cars trapped under smog, and the elburz mountains, shrouded in ghostly white, towering over it all."
6378,charge,"and he saw his little sister, her tongue blue from eating too many candies, color-coordinating her crayons, ready to charge a fee to anyone who wanted to borrow one."
6379,where,where are you?
6380,where,"afterward, she turned around, to the doorway where shirin stood."
6381,taken,"she knew she had not taken them, but  f  the septembers of shiraz  was there any way to be certain?"
6382,question,"it will turn up.” she hoped, all the while, that the question of the missing teapot would not arise."
6383,inside,"she imagines there are tiny elves inside her scarf, crumpling paper against her ears all day long just to irritate her."
6384,where,"she walks to the other side of the playground, by the school entrance, where jamshid the janitor is half asleep in the lunch-hour glare of the sun."
6385,taken,take them.” the departed ring has taken her appetite with it.
6386,wall,"she leans against a wall, slides to the ground, notices candy wrappers by her feet, sailing on the wind’s whim."
6387,where,"where could it have gone, that ring?"
6388,middle ages,"her father had told her all about sapphires, worn by archbishops in the middle ages, believed by buddhists to protect the wearer from illness and disaster, and said by the devout to have been the stone on which the ten commandments had been carved."
6389,gate,she stands by the iron gate and presses the bell.
6390,gate,"“farnaz-khanoum!” the housekeeper says, unlatching the gate."
6391,where,"where’s isaac?” “i need to talk to you.”  they walk inside, where it is bright and warm."
6392,where,“where’s isaac?” keyvan says.
6393,jail,how could i tell baba ha-  52  the septembers of shiraz  kim and afshin-khanoum that their son is in jail?
6394,court,"on it is the familiar tea set, of yellow porcelain with a garden motif—passed down to keyvan by his great-grandfather, a court painter during the reign of the qajar king nasir al-din shah."
6395,wall,"“how will we sustain ourselves—with love?” she extends a cup to farnaz but looks at her husband, who glances back at her for an instant before turning his gaze to a painting on the wall, of the qajar king nasir al-din shah, made by his great-grandfather in 1892."
6396,arrest,“but what if they arrest me?
6397,jail,how will this painting—and all the pages i’ve written about it in all those useless art magazines—help me in jail?
6398,crime,"“my only crime is being my father’s son,” he says, looking down."
6399,guard,.” a guard yells out the names as he makes his way up and down the hallway.
6400,where,"if you don’t hear your name, thank god, if you do hear your name, say a prayer.” there is commotion in the hallway—metal doors, footsteps, the rattling of keys, sighs, and a man screaming, over and over, “where?"
6401,where,where?
6402,where,"where?” “that’s gholampour,” mehdi says."
6403,authority,"isaac almost yells at him again for his repugnant manners, but he realizes that he is not the boy’s father and has no authority over him."
6404,guard,"“shut up, boy!” a guard yells."
6405,guard,"“brother,” the guard says."
6406,cell,"“sounds routine.” when he is out of the cell he hears mehdi continue, “may god be with you.”  back in the room where he had been interrogated on the  first day, about three weeks ago, he sees a masked man behind the table."
6407,situation,"if he turns the tables on his interrogator and asks if he has any witnesses claiming that he is a spy, then he would be worsening the situation."
6408,arrested,it occurs to him that his brother javad may have also been arrested; with his loose tongue javad was sure to slip and say something incriminating.
6409,law,"his brother-in-law keyvan may also be in prison, given his father’s connections."
6410,coercion,"if his wife is, in fact, in the women’s block, could she have succumbed to coercion?"
6411,guilt,the thought overwhelms him with guilt.
6412,hole,"mohsen pulls back and exhales, clouding isaac with a thick puff of smoke, which burns his cheek, as though a hole had been drilled through it."
6413,cell,your resistance is pointless.”  when he is brought back to his cell he finds mehdi pol-  ishing a piece of wood and ramin sleeping.
6414,arrested,before they arrested me i had promised my little girl i would make one for her and we would paint it together.
6415,arrest,it was the morning of his arrest.
6416,war,"“is there a shortage of flowers also, because of the war?” she joked one night as he came home and found her, as usual, in front of the television."
6417,where,"“so where are my flowers, my dear husband?” he could not bring himself to say anything; he did not feel he had enough strength left in him for another argument."
6418,locked,"but may i remind you, madame amin, that had you not believed that i would one day reach this status, you would never have married me?” she got up and locked herself in the bathroom, leaving behind her familiar trail of perfume, which gave him a sudden headache."
6419,prisons,"67  nine  f prisons, she knows little."
6420,bastille,"the tower of london, the bastille, alcatraz—these are places that farnaz associates most readily with the word."
6421,prisons,"of course, she knows—has always known—that in her own time and her own city, prisons also exist."
6422,bastille,"she remembers helping parviz with his history lesson on the storming of the bastille, telling him about the mob that invaded the hôtel des invalides for ammunition and gathered outside the prison, about the fighting that erupted, and about the governor of paris, a certain marquis de launey, who, finding himself impotent in the face of such fury, had opened the gates, and consequently led the way to his own death: only hours later his decapitated head was paraded down the streets on a pike."
6423,inside,"her visit to the previous prison had not terrified her as much, perhaps because its location in the city center made it seem less remote, making the events taking place inside it less forbidding."
6424,inside,"this morning, as she got dressed, her stomach churned as she pictured herself walking inside the prison, the gates slamming shut behind her."
6425,sink,"“shall i come with you today, khanoum?” she had said, without looking up, and farnaz, still bent over the sink, her stomach sending small aftershocks throughout her body, had said, “yes."
6426,guard,“what do you want?” a guard says.
6427,gate,wait here.” he opens the gate and disappears behind it.
6428,gate,"“he liked the idea that someone like you would have a friend like me.” the second guard watches them as they wait by the  71  dalia sofer  gate, his rifle hanging from his shoulder, his black beard so thick that it darkens the entire southern hemisphere of his face."
6429,gate,the gate opens and the first guard reappears.
6430,where,"habibeh nods under her chador, mumbling to herself, “basheh, dorost misheh —it will be all right.” the guard leads them to a desk where an official writes their names and the purpose of their visit."
6431,guard,"farnaz flinches, but when she sees the guard and the official watching her, she loses her voice—forgets, even, that she has one."
6432,state,he is thrown against the official’s table and told to state his name.
6433,guard,“you know this man?” the guard yells.
6434,taken,"he was armenian, tall and thin—as farnaz imagined a pianist trained in vienna should be—and she had been taken with him from the moment she saw him."
6435,taken,"when he found out that she liked singing, that she had, in fact, taken voice lessons until the age of eighteen, when her father decided that it was no longer appropriate for a young woman to sing in public, he asked her to accompany him as he played debussy’s “il pleure dans mon coeur,” based on a poem by verlaine."
6436,guard,"a guard wearing a black mask arrives, a file tucked under his arm."
6437,guard,"as he removes the pianist’s blindfold, farnaz notices that a finger on the guard’s right hand is missing."
6438,inside,"another man in a black mask drags farnaz through a dark, narrow corridor, and shoves her inside a windowless room, not much larger than a closet."
6439,where,"he played for them on many occasions.” “brother, i really would like to find out where my husband is.” “you know what will happen to him, to this dandy of a pianist?"
6440,locked,he’ll hear his own recordings at his funeral!” the locked room is lit only by a bulb dangling from  74  the septembers of shiraz  the ceiling.
6441,inside,"how many rooms, like this one, exist inside this prison, this city, this country?"
6442,where,"is this where it would be written, his magnum opus—requiem for vartan sofoyan?"
6443,guard,"those who have to work, work.” “i could afford it thanks to my husband, who worked very hard.” “yes,” the guard smiles."
6444,imprison,"if they imprison her,  75  dalia sofer  what would happen to shirin?"
6445,charged,i am not charged with anything.
6446,guard,please just tell me if my husband is here.” the guard steps away from her and opens the door.
6447,prisoner,"let’s go, sister.” standing in the dim room, hearing the pleading voice of a prisoner being questioned somewhere nearby, she feels the prison as a real place—made of concrete and steel, where  76  the septembers of shiraz  people wake up, eat, use the toilet, and sleep, their tedious routine interrupted by the terror of interrogations."
6448,death,"for most people, she thinks, the notion of death is no more than a wallpaper—present but rarely seen."
6449,prisoners,"prisoners, who have little to distract them, have no choice but to stare at this wallpaper."
6450,gate,another guard opens the gate for her.
6451,question,“they also asked me whether i like being a servant.” “what kind of a question is that?
6452,injustice,my son says there is a lot of injustice that needs to be set right.” “what?
6453,arrest,"farnaz wonders if morteza, whom isaac hired a few years ago as an office manger, had anything to do with her husband’s arrest."
6454,building,"80  t en  arviz’s exit out of the subway coincides with the end of studies at the neighborhood yeshiva, and scores of boys and young men in black suits and earlocks congregating outside the red brick building in clusters of twos and threes."
6455,where,"he walks past the yeshiva, and past the neighboring houses and shops, where silver wine cups and candelabras catch the afternoon rays behind the glass windows."
6456,jail,"“my father, too, had been in jail, before i was born.” “yes?"
6457,where,where?” “leningrad.
6458,incarcerated,"that’s where the rebbe’s father-in-law was also incarcerated.” he says this with pride rather than outrage, or sadness even."
6459,charged,"“what was he charged with, your father?” “charged with?"
6460,charged,"my dear parviz, he was charged with being a jew."
6461,state,he was charged with not relinquishing his religion when lenin’s state demanded it.” “but it’s different with my father.
6462,where,"he was exiled to vladivostok, in siberia, where he met my mother, rebecca, the daughter of another exile, lazar rosenfeldt."
6463,where,"that’s where i was born.”  83  dalia sofer  on the windowpane is a framed black-and-white photograph of a bearded man, staring into the camera with dark, serious eyes—a look that could be interpreted as triumph, or as hardened grief."
6464,taken,"this photograph was taken three weeks after i was born, in the winter of 1934."
6465,guard,my father never smiled in public because a prison guard had knocked out his teeth.
6466,sink,"that was our little compromise.” he leaves his half-eaten yogurt on the  85  dalia sofer  counter, rinses his hands in a small sink, and resumes steaming."
6467,situation,"but why is it, he wonders, that no one understands his situation?"
6468,where,"“well, good-bye, mr. mendelson.” “alaichem shalom—peace be with you!” • • •  87  dalia sofer  he walks into the gray, humid afternoon, where people  are carrying on with the day—the woman buying bread from yanki; the old man walking home, the fringes of his tallit peering from the bottom of his jacket a reminder, to himself and to the rest of the world, of who he is."
6469,where,"88  el even  eila’s family seems to live on the floor—the floor is where they eat, sleep, pray."
6470,locked,"twice he unfolded them and nearly placed them on her shoulder, but both times he retrieved them and locked them again, in resignation."
6471,inside,"they walked back inside the school, through the fluorescent-lit corridors, which, stripped of the chaos of the other children, seemed to her sinister and ghostly—a mausoleum."
6472,convict,"later in bed, shirin thought of her monopoly game, of that square in the corner with the distraught convict behind bars."
6473,taken,“i don’t know.” “my father says the people who are being taken to prison are sinners.
6474,arrest,"she has come to believe that these final moments may hold in them the answer to his arrest, but she recalls nothing extraordinary about that morning, cannot even remember, for example, whether he had kissed her on her forehead before leaving, as he sometimes did."
6475,arrest,"she has tried, also, to retrace the comings and goings of visitors during the few weeks prior to his departure, hoping to discover a clue to his arrest."
6476,inside,inside were two hairpins decorated with crystal-studded cherries.
6477,killing,my back is killing me.
6478,where,"women would ask her where she had bought a certain bag, or a pair of shoes, or a silk scarf, and she would smile and say, “oh, this?"
6479,chain,leila pulls a hanging chain and a small light comes on.
6480,where,"there is an armoire with a broken door, filled with old clothes—pastel-colored skirts and geometric-patterned silk scarves where perfume still lingers."
6481,wall,framed artworks lean against a wall—watercolor landscapes and charcoal drawings.
6482,inside,shirin shoves the lid with her foot and sees brownish bottles inside.
6483,charge,charge: treason.
6484,charge,"next to the charge is a log: eight o’clock, no one home; noon, housekeeper says they are traveling; midnight, guards break in, housekeeper gone also."
6485,suspect,next attempt: suspect’s beach house in ramsar.
6486,charges,"they are all the same, with different names, ages, and occupations, but similar charges—royalist, zionist, advocate of indecency."
6487,charge,"doesn’t charge mean doing something wrong, for which one must go to prison?"
6488,suspects,what if she suspects something?
6489,charge,charge: advocate of indecency.
6490,prisoners,97  twelve  nce a week the prisoners are allowed to spend an hour outside their cells.
6491,jail,"today isaac sits by the prison mosque with mehdi and ramin and a few other men he has met since his arrival, some six weeks ago: hamid, a low-ranking general from the shah’s army; reza, a young revolutionary who was involved in the capture of the american hostages but ended up in jail, presumably for helping his father, a minister of the shah, escape the country; and old man muhammad, whom no one knows much about, except that he has three daughters in the women’s block—one for being a communist, one for being an adulteress, and the third for being their sister."
6492,guard,"my father and i stopped talking a long time ago.” a guard approaches, points his rifle at the group."
6493,crime,is that a crime?
6494,cell,"back in his cell isaac thinks of reza and the thousands of revolutionaries like him—men and women who thought they were part of something big, much bigger than their daily lives—who thought they were changing the course of history."
6495,state,"guests from all over the world—heads of state and other dignitaries—had attended the ceremonies, designed to pay homage to cyrus, the founder of the persian empire, and to darius, whose magnificent city of persepolis had once been the symbol of the greatest civilization."
6496,camp,"among the stone ruins, just outside shiraz, the shah had built a tent city for his visitors, inspired by francis i’s camp created in the sixteenth century on france’s west coast to receive henry viii of england."
6497,inside,"a half-full glass is on the table in front of him, the tea inside looking cold."
6498,arrest,"farnaz has been here for the entire afternoon, but she has yet to tell them about their son’s arrest."
6499,question,"before each game she asks a question, and if the game is resolved successfully, it means that the augury will be positive; if not, then it will be negative."
6500,locked,"he turns his gaze to the room, glances at his tea, then at the locked liquor cabinet."
6501,sentence,"what had allowed her to tolerate him, on that trip to isfahan so long ago, was a single sentence."
6502,sentence,"“please make isaac happy, farnaz-jan, because we never did.” with this sentence he had made her realize that despite all the things his character lacked, which were many, he possessed at least the capacity to admit who he was: a bad father."
6503,where,"it reminds her of the ascension mosque in jerusalem, where they say jesus left behind a footprint as he went up to heaven."
6504,building,"for a building to be strong, here the professor quoted john ruskin, it must accomplish what it was designed to do, and do so efficiently, without an excess of stone, glass, steel."
6505,where,"a bridge, he thinks, is the only place where uncertainty is permissible, where one can exist with no connection to any land—or any person—but with the reassurance that connection is possible."
6506,taken,"he first learned these numbers for a test, but unlike a lot of the information that fades once a test has been taken and passed, these figures had stayed with him."
6507,inside,"not a moment to myself.” looking at her from below, her body lost inside her coat, her pale skin half lit in the dusk, he finds her rather pretty."
6508,inside,"she looks inside, then at him, with the same seriousness as before."
6509,arrest,"113  dalia sofer  he thinks of his father, imagines the day of his arrest."
6510,death,"114  fi ft een  bsence, shirin thinks, is death’s cousin."
6511,where,"is it possible that, like the magician’s assistant, they are existing in some other world—a place where they cannot be seen, heard, touched, smelled?"
6512,case,"in the kitchen shirin opens the refrigerator and takes out the milk, which, she knows, has to be boiled first in case it is spoiled."
6513,where,“go where?” shirin says.
6514,taken,"one photograph, of a young woman—not her mother—in a see-through white dress, taken from the back, makes her stop."
6515,taken,"she likes that the photograph was taken from the back, that at the moment the shutter snapped, the woman had no idea that she was being captured by a curious eye, probably male, probably her father’s."
6516,clink,"what she remembers of him is the nickname “aghaye siyasat— mr. politics.” he would begin any conversation with “did you hear of so and so’s election?” or “what did you think of such and such assassination?”—things she did not understand but which prompted discussions that continued well into the night, long after she had gone to bed, when she would lie in her dark bedroom and listen to the adults’ voices, punctuated by the clink of ice cubes in whiskey glasses."
6517,death,the night she heard of kourosh’s death was the first time she heard her father cry.
6518,where,"where would she begin ripping, in the middle— first tearing it in half and then into pieces, a lock of hair here, a squinting eye there?"
6519,where,"at night, alone in her bedroom, she would build the toy and add it to her collection on the shelf above her desk, where they all stood, side by side—the zebra, the cat, the warplane, the car—residues of her mother’s private life."
6520,cell,"water enters the cell through the broken window, gathering into a puddle."
6521,cell,together they drag their way out of the cell.
6522,where,has the boy forgotten where he is?
6523,prisoners,in the hallway they join the flock of prisoners making  i  dalia sofer  their way to the showers.
6524,inside,"isaac has learned not to look at the naked bodies passing by, at the blistered feet with black nails stepping inside gray puddles on the slimy ceramic floor."
6525,where,"he steps out of the shower, his clothes on his arm, looking for an empty spot where he can get dressed."
6526,guard,".” “yes, i know.” a guard, watching them, approaches."
6527,prisoner,"through the water’s gurgle comes a prisoner’s cry, followed by guards’ admonitions."
6528,cell,"this is not the plaza, you son of a dog.”  “i wonder what they’re doing to him,” isaac says to me-  hdi when they are back in the cell."
6529,cell,the rain has stopped but the cell is humid and cold.
6530,imprisoned,"you had to pretend the secret police did not exist.” “yes, but at least savak imprisoned and tortured people for one reason—to get information and discourage future subversives."
6531,arrested,you only got arrested if you actually did something.
6532,guard,we have more in common than i would care to admit.” a guard calls for isaac.
6533,taken,"he is taken downstairs, to a different room this time."
6534,prisoner,"some three weeks ago the news that mohsen had released a prisoner on the spot had spread throughout the prison, making the men more lighthearted, like children anticipating the summer during the final days of school."
6535,prisoner,"but when, a week later, he shot another prisoner just as spontaneously as he had released the first, anguish had resettled among the men."
6536,where,"where is he?” “brother, i really don’t know."
6537,cell,"but by then, my dear brother, it will be too late.” when isaac returns to the cell he finds ramin on his mattress, cleaning the spaces between his toes."
6538,where,where is he now?
6539,cell,"“you should at least pray here, in the cell."
6540,guard,"what if a guard comes to check up on you?” “amin-agha, are you a religious man?” the boy asks."
6541,jail,"“yes, i got the tattoo after they took her to jail.” “it’s beautiful.” “so is she,” ramin says."
6542,jailed,"i want to be a photographer.” it pleases isaac that the boy speaks in the present—i want to be a photographer, not i wanted—that all this, his dead father and his jailed mother and his own uncertain fate, is just a transitory phase, a simple interruption."
6543,guard,the door opens and a guard sticks his head in.
6544,guard,the guard walks in and lifts him off the floor.
6545,prisoner,you are a prisoner!
6546,guard,"when the guard lets go of his arm he says, calmly, “brother, i am not a religious person, but if i were, i’m certain god would forgive me for being ill.” “you are digging your grave with your own hands!” the guard leaves, banging the metal door behind him and rattling his keys for a while before locking it."
6547,taken,"one, with a bushy black beard and chapped lips, looks disheveled, even dirty, and were it not for his rifle she would  w  the septembers of shiraz  have taken him for a laborer."
6548,where,"farnaz takes her daughter’s hand and together they walk to her own bedroom, where mounds of clothes are already on the floor."
6549,question,"“most of the time, yes,” farnaz says, unsure of the question’s significance."
6550,charge,is that the charge brought against him?” a moment of silence follows and she reproaches herself for having said this.
6551,situation,"“how unfortunate that you don’t recognize the gravity of your situation.” he stands up and moves close to her, so close that his chest touches her breasts."
6552,where,where is habibeh when she is needed?
6553,taken,"had she been here, she could have taken shirin to the park or for a walk."
6554,inside,"he picks up a box of sanitary pads, peeks inside it."
6555,inside,"farnaz slides her arm inside the sleeve to give it some shape, and as her hand emerges from the sleeve’s end the man says, “nice ."
6556,where,"she throws the shirt back on the pile of clothes, where it lies limp and wrinkled."
6557,war,“that was just a little something an american soldier gave him during the war.” the man keeps the cap as evidence.
6558,taken,she had taken that picture during their first trip together.
6559,where,they had spent the night in a motel where the pillowcases displayed the brown rings of unwashed heads and the hallways smelled of urine.
6560,wall,"she stands in the doorway, her eyes on  the bags of evidence lined against the wall."
6561,where,“where were you?” the man asks her.
6562,inside,"they pull out  136  the septembers of shiraz  their knives and split open the pillows and sofa cushions, sliding their hands through the slits in the hope of finding more evidence sewn inside."
6563,war,"huddled like this with shirin, she remembers the early days of the war, when the terrible thunder of iraqi bombs falling over a blacked-out tehran would send the three of them to their hiding place under the stairs—a spot that gave them an illusion of cover but in fact was no safer than any other place in the house."
6564,wall,"there they would sit with a candle, and as they would wait for the bombs to pass, isaac would distract them with puppet shows of singing cats and quarreling frogs—shadows of his nimble hands reflected on the opposite wall."
6565,pen,i live here.” zalman puts down his pen and removes his glasses.
6566,imprisoned,"are you sorry, for example, that your father was imprisoned and had to leave russia?"
6567,question,i cannot question it.
6568,taken,"what is the point after all, of having such arms and not being able to embrace those who are taken with them?"
6569,where,"“where is your coat, rachel?” zalman asks."
6570,custody,naturally she got custody of their daughter too.
6571,where,"people won’t take to it.” “where would i transport it, mr. broukhim?"
6572,where,but who knows where you’ll end up in a few years?
6573,where,"once you leave your own country and start moving around, there is no telling where you’ll go next.” he disappears into the back, emerges with rachel’s coat, and hands it to parviz."
6574,charge,"shirin and the other girls, gathered here for leila’s birthday, lay out pillows and cushions on the floor, while farideh-khanoum stands by the stereo, in charge of the music."
6575,where,"but where would she hide the files, since she doesn’t have her schoolbag?"
6576,inside,"people reside inside their bodies for decades, but they rarely examine these vessels, and all their intricate, dutiful parts."
6577,prisoners,"“yes, fine.” he is sitting outside with the usual group of prisoners, which now includes vartan, the pianist, who is not a talkative man, at least not here."
6578,cell,"but just as overeating the night before the fast of yom kippur does nothing to quell the hunger that inevitably surges during the final hours of that long day of atonement and fasting, so too the deep breaths did little to help him endure those unending days spent in his dank cell."
6579,prisoners,"the prisoners have nicknamed vartan “maestro,” out of  153  dalia sofer  both derision and affection."
6580,court,what was it like to be the court jester?” “i was not a court jester.
6581,trial,"i played at the rudaki opera house.” “agha-reza, stop putting everyone on trial, will you?” hamid says."
6582,guard,the guard hossein stands a few yards away.
6583,prisoners,"he is the most lenient of the guards and usually allows the prisoners to talk, if the discussion is innocent enough."
6584,interrogation,"if you are taken to interrogation this week, i strongly advise each of you to repent.” “repent?” the old man muhammad-agha says."
6585,case,"and in any case, i have nothing to go back to."
6586,killing,"“i wish that at least after killing us they would pay our families the blood money.” “blood money is owed only when a believer accidentally kills another believer,” hamid says."
6587,cell,"and remember what i told you.” walking back to the cell, isaac wonders whether he could, in fact, repent."
6588,crime,"since he is innocent of any crime they may be charging him with, he could repent only for the act of living."
6589,inside,"farnaz tries to sneak a look past his shoulder, but except for a large green truck parked inside she cannot see much."
6590,gate,and how do you know?” morteza taps his fingers on the iron gate.
6591,where,“where are you taking everything?” “to a safe place.
6592,gate,you must have other things to worry about.” he steps back and shuts the gate.
6593,gang,and how could the others gang up on isaac and rob him of everything?
6594,authority,still there are times when one needs the illusion of authority.
6595,imprisoned,"in the old days keyvan, with one phone call to his father, could have had someone like morteza imprisoned for life."
6596,gate,"when keyvan arrives, he walks with her to the gate and presses the buzzer."
6597,gate,"morteza opens the gate, looking more irritated than before."
6598,where,we’re taking the gemstones for safekeeping.” “where?” “i have no time for this.” he pushes the gate shut but keyvan holds it open with his arm.
6599,trial,“he hasn’t even had a trial yet.” “trial?” morteza laughs.
6600,trial,“if you think there is going to be a trial you’re going to be very disappointed.
6601,case,"in any case, all we are doing here is protecting his assets, but arrogant idiots like you mistake our kindness for thievery.” “come on, morteza,” keyvan hisses."
6602,injustice,"it is about a collection of men—men who turned their backs to injustice, men who profited from a corrupt government, men who built themselves villas and traveled whenever they pleased to places the likes of me have never even heard of."
6603,power,"you are all hypocrites who have suddenly come into power, and you don’t know how to handle it.” “shut up, you dirty jew!” morteza thunders."
6604,wall,she turns to the wall to hide her tears.
6605,war,"she hears her father, remembers how he would stand at the head of the table on the eve of sabbath, one hand holding the prayer book, the other the cup of wine, reciting the prayers with a sad baritone that hushed everything before him—the sparkling dinnerware waiting to be filled with stew, the crystal glasses expecting wine, and his radio, which remained on whenever  164  the septembers of shiraz  he was home, reporting on the war in europe and the arrival to the throne of the new shah, the so-called “spineless” son of the deposed reza shah."
6606,inside,"that’s how it works!” they had walked for a long time without talking, her hand inside his, her ankle twisting every now and then."
6607,inside,"come, let’s get our sweets and forget about who likes the jews and who doesn’t.”  166  the septembers of shiraz  they walked inside the shop, and as her father selected pastries, she caught a glimpse of herself in the back mirror."
6608,where,"he buys the daisies, which rachel explains convey affection, and when he arrives home he leaves them for her on the stoop, where she always stands."
6609,awaiting,"he thinks of those he had known back home—mojgan and nahid, and  169  dalia sofer  even yassi, his girlfriend of two years—how despite their teasing manners they safeguarded their honor, like jewelers awaiting appraisal of their stones—how pure, how precious, how much?"
6610,prisoners,"their names appear in the paper’s list of executed, and by the time isaac and the other prisoners are taken outside for their weekly dose of air, in the early afternoon, the news has spread among the men like the warning of cholera in a damp city."
6611,wall,"the old man sits on the ground hugging his bony knees, the boy leans against a wall, arms crossed against his chest, glassy-eyed."
6612,death,"and so it is, isaac thinks, that three generations have bonded through death."
6613,cell,"then in his wrinkled voice, he says, “if the rug of your luck has been woven in black, even the water of zamzam cannot whiten it.”  in the cell, mehdi is asleep on his mattress, his right foot  a swollen mass, the toe now completely black."
6614,inside,"he watches his sunken face, all dry skin and bones, with two yellow lids marooned inside their deep, gray sockets."
6615,cell,they won’t let me go to the hospital.” the door of the cell opens and a guard shoves ramin with such force that he lands facedown on his mattress.
6616,guard,"“you want to end up like your mother, you mule?”  172  the septembers of shiraz  “brother, is the other guard, hossein-agha, on duty today?” isaac asks."
6617,guard,"why?” “he had suggested a verse from the koran for me to contemplate, and i wanted to discuss it with him.” “he’ll have the night shift,” the guard says, eyeing isaac suspiciously."
6618,cell,"he plans to grab the dinner tray as it glides into the cell, its tarnished metal cold against his hand, and hold it long enough to ask hossein for help."
6619,cell,"unlike the others, his hardness is interrupted, sometimes, by glimmers of kindness, as when he had escorted isaac to his cell that first night, when he had brought him an aspirin, or when he had informed the prisoners about the increased executions."
6620,prisoner,"but a prisoner should only die of his crime, not of illness.” “why don’t you preoccupy yourself with your own situation?"
6621,state,"other people’s health problems are none of your business.” “brother, even i, in my miserable state, cannot just sit here and watch a man die."
6622,inside,he plucks the meat from the chicken bones and wraps it inside the thin lavash bread.
6623,where,"one man slides his hands under mehdi’s armpits, the other holds on to his ankles, and together they lower him onto the wood, where he lands with a thump."
6624,guard,.” a guard calls out names.
6625,inside,.” hearing his own name isaac feels the terror hardened inside him over so many months spill through his body like molten rock.
6626,prisoners,"your names have been called.” ramin opens his eyes then shuts them again, until a guard comes, grabs isaac by his shirt collar and the boy by his ear, and drags the two into the hallway, where other prisoners are also gathered, among them the pianist."
6627,sink,"the men are brought one flight down, into a fluorescent-lit room with chipping walls and blackened linoleum floors, a rusted metal sink, a snaking hose, a black bucket, and reddish-brown stains everywhere."
6628,where,"the grouping is reminiscent of other selections he has read about, where the able-bodied were kept for labor and the old were parceled to the gas chambers."
6629,guard,the door opens and a guard walks in.
6630,building,they walk out of the room and out of the building through a back exit.
6631,inside,"they make lefts and rights, deep inside the prison’s belly."
6632,guard,isaac turns around but the guard presses a rifle into his lower back.
6633,building,they continue walking until they reach another building.
6634,cell,"the guard opens the gate and they are led inside, each man shoved into a separate cell."
6635,sink,isaac’s room is a square large enough to hold a mattress and a sink.
6636,inside,"as he is thrown inside it he crouches on the floor, trying to stop the tremor running through his wracked body."
6637,pleading,"then they begin, one after the other, the bullets flying in the air, men shrieking, men pleading, bodies thumping to the ground."
6638,death,"he thinks of ramin, his death separated from his mother’s by no more than a day, and of vartan, his final audience a firing squad."
6639,execution,a messenger reporting her father’s execution?
6640,suspect,"i told you, didn’t i, that my father works with the revolutionary guards?” it occurs to shirin that the missing file about uncle  179  dalia sofer  javad makes her an obvious suspect."
6641,prisons,"he said he got a lot of mangled bodies from prisons, and this really bothered him."
6642,jail,"“my parents think that with your father already in jail, you wouldn’t do something like that."
6643,police,"“do you know why your father is in prison?” “no.” “he didn’t work for savak, did he?” “what is savak?” “it was the shah’s secret police."
6644,tortured,"he says they killed and tortured thousands of people.” “no, not my father.” “but how can you be sure?"
6645,police,that’s why it was called a secret police.
6646,cell,"she wonders if her father sees it too, from his cell’s window."
6647,inside,"the windows sweat from inside, steam slowly rising from the corners and erasing the city."
6648,inside,"she imagines briefly what it would be like to live inside habibeh’s body, to look and smell like her, to wear her dappled clothes."
6649,law,"you know that if you tell me the truth you will sound as arrogant and conceited as that sister-  185  dalia sofer  in-law of yours, shahla-khanoum."
6650,where,"everyone holds back, she thinks, in this country where you can get in trouble for looking at someone the wrong way, saying the wrong thing, being the wrong religion."
6651,retribution,"“maybe it’s time someone paid.” this tea that she is drinking, with spices that calm her nerves, was brewed by a woman for whom isaac’s elimination is a matter of collective retribution."
6652,inside,"and yet she drinks it, has drunk thousands like it, never considering the potential malignancy of the hands that spooned the leaves and dropped them inside the teapot."
6653,sink,he does not need to pay.” habibeh turns back to the sink and skins the chicken.
6654,where,“my son works hard!” “and you’ve come a long way from where you started.
6655,taken,"she looks at habibeh’s stooped back, remembers the time they had taken her and morteza to their villa up north, when shirin was still a baby and parviz was quizzing everyone on history."
6656,where,"as he watched her from below, searching his mind for the right response, she continued, “come with me to the park one day, and we’ll look at more plants.” afterward when she had gone back inside, he stood for some time in the windy afternoon, where, in the circular sound of his neighbors’ chimes, he heard his mother’s melodic laughter."
6657,where,"to see canopies where he sees leaves, to see dancing limbs where he sees sad branches waiting for the summer months."
6658,where,"they arrive in a shaded nook, where trees and overgrown shrubs stand in disarray."
6659,where,"he does not want to slip into her secure but stringent world, nor does he expect her to slip into his—an unmarked road where visibility is poor."
6660,inside,"they walk aimlessly, getting lost inside the park’s arteries, eventually aligning themselves with the sun, now lying westward and losing its brilliance."
6661,sink,he is glad to have a sink in his room; he rinses his face several times a day and lies back down.
6662,cell,"he hears the steps he has grown accustomed to—someone running up and down the stairs above his cell, with the lightness of a child."
6663,cell,after his breakfast of tea and bread the door to his cell opens.
6664,guard,"“it’s time for your shower, brother,” a masked guard says."
6665,guard,"he looks into the guard’s gray eyes and says, “brother hossein?” “yes,” the guard says."
6666,prisoner,"a dozen benches have been placed here, each one occupied by a prisoner and a guard sitting side by side."
6667,case,"“if you are innocent, you will get out.” “but that isn’t always the case, is it?"
6668,guilty,and some guilty ones get away.
6669,guard,"195  dalia sofer  “what were you doing before you were a prison guard, if i may ask, brother?” “i was a mason."
6670,cell,we must take the weeds out of the soil.”  back in his cell he lies down.
6671,cell,"again he hears someone running up and down the stairs above his cell—he knows it is a child because of the speed, that lightness in the step that can only belong to one who has his entire life before him, and believes that this life will be good."
6672,cell,the door to his cell opens and a guard walks in.
6673,pen,“perhaps we will have better luck this time.” he hands isaac a paper and a pen.
6674,pen,"“take all the time you need.” he sits down, holds the pen, which feels foreign in his hand."
6675,where,"if this were a game of poker, this would be the point where isaac would have to either raise the stakes despite a mediocre hand, or recognize his defeat and fold."
6676,where,"you still wish to go on protecting him?” “brother, i swear to you i have no idea where he is.” mohsen keeps on reading."
6677,confinement,"i enjoy being with my family, or spending time alone.” “ah, a specialist in solitary confinement!"
6678,interrogation,a pungent odor of sweat and blood spills into the interrogation room.
6679,where,where is he?” isaac says nothing.
6680,where,"mohsen walks to the door, where the voices have once again quieted down."
6681,where,"where are you, my farnaz?"
6682,cell,his cell is dark.
6683,guard,a guard places a tray by his mattress.
6684,wall,"isaac sits up, leans against the wall."
6685,hole,"he sees the boy’s body, naked, a hole in his forehead, lying in a morgue."
6686,inside,"201  twen ty -ei ght  o kill time before her meeting with isaac’s brother, farnaz walks through the bazaar, running her hands over the silks and chiffons in fabric shops, smelling the spices inside giant sacks, flipping carpets to examine their craftsmanship."
6687,where,"she stands across from the silversmith, where last night, during a harried telephone call from a public phone, javad begged her to see him."
6688,where,"“where have you been?” “oh, here and there, you know."
6689,arrest,"the friend who told me about isaac’s arrest tells me that the revolutionary guards are after me also.” “my god, javad!"
6690,where,"“so i’m going to a small village up north, where i know a family that has agreed to take me in for a few weeks.” “and then?” “by then, i’m expecting to receive lots of cash for a transaction ."
6691,executed,"“if they catch you, you’ll be executed right off, javad!"
6692,bail,"“you not only fund his ridiculous schemes, you also bail him out once he is in trouble,” she would say, and isaac, having run out of arguments in defense of his little brother, would answer simply, “the money gives him hope to start over."
6693,where,"and i’ll tell you, with my track record, i don’t have much of a chance.” by the fruit vendor, where they stand, the sweet-sour smell of pomegranates in their red and golden skins and bowing crowns fills the morning."
6694,pleading,"she looks at him, striped with vertical rays of light, his eyes pleading."
6695,where,they turn into an abandoned alley jutting out of the bazaar where empty crates and bags  205  dalia sofer  of trash are stacked one on top of the other.
6696,sentence,look for the sentence ‘the children have grown up and they are looking to settle down.’” she hands him the check.
6697,state,"“one day you and isaac and the children and i will get together somewhere wonderful, by the seine in paris or by the empire state building in new york or at the alhambra in spain."
6698,imprisoned,"imprisoned husband, sickly daughter, disloyal housekeeper, stolen possessions, and now, a fugitive brother-in-law—a marked man on both sides of the caspian, smuggling vodka into the country, and himself out."
6699,alleged,"and she, linked to him with the check she just handed him, in care of some alleged antiques dealer, from whom she must now pick up a sixteenth-century miniature."
6700,ordered,"what an illusion, she thinks, the idea of an ordered, ordinary life."
6701,sink,"he has lifted the other and placed his foot in the sink, washing out the caked blood from his sole."
6702,case,since the lashings he has come to realize that his socalled case is not so much a case as it is an endurance test.
6703,clink,six in the morning—the clink of milk bottles outside his door.
6704,cell,in the dim cell he cannot see the guard’s eyes.
6705,state,i will bring you some clean bandages for your feet.” “thank you.” “now eat.”  209  dalia sofer  • • • because of the snow and the state of his feet he cannot get fresh air.
6706,cell,"you seem to me a decent man, despite the way you lived.” again isaac hears the footsteps above his cell."
6707,tortured,"you know, he was in this same prison for many years, and was tortured by savak."
6708,torture,"well, that’s not the only torture he underwent."
6709,prisoners,"bringing him to the prison and letting him run free among the prisoners is his way of saying, to himself and to everyone else, what is god’s will, no frost can kill."
6710,cell,"that i sit here inside a cell not fit for a pig, my feet on their way to gangrene, my eyes on their way to blindness, my body wasted and shriveled?"
6711,sink,"farnaz knows this as she cups the eggshells in her hand, piece by piece, to throw them in the trash, drops the frying pan in the sink, and returns the omelet ingredients to their respective homes."
6712,punishment,"they make it to school, some fifteen minutes late, and as she drives to the antiques shop to pick up the miniature,  a  dalia sofer  farnaz thinks of the punishment shirin will no doubt receive for being late—a sermon about responsibility in front of the rest of the class, or extra homework for one week—small humiliations accumulating in her young life."
6713,case,"javad had said that you would hold a miniature aside for me, in case the government asks me what i bought with  215  dalia sofer  the money."
6714,where,"let me get it for you.” he disappears in the back of the shop, where dust particles float in the watery light of late morning."
6715,locked,"he sold some to a museum in new york, others to private collectors.” she looks at the orphaned leaf, its counterparts spread around the globe, each adopted by one museum or another, or locked in the cabinet of a european or american collector who picks it up once in a while and looks at it in his dim study, his acquisition filling him with pride not unlike that of a nineteenth-century colonialist in search of a piece of the orient."
6716,where,"i suppose anything is possible.” the painting—the thin, precise lines, the red and gold of a courtesan’s robe, the indigo mosaic of the floor, where the slain king sits, his sword and shield by his side—  217  dalia sofer  becomes for her the embodiment of loss, and she is pleased to have it, if only for a short time."
6717,taken,"“you are taken with it,” the art dealer says."
6718,case,"in any case, thank you."
6719,guilty,"she feels guilty, also, for having suspected her in the first place."
6720,taken,and now even he has been taken from me .
6721,death,in the quiet of the afternoon farnaz watches isaac’s mother and considers the possibility of baba-hakim’s death.
6722,pleading,please tell me the truth.” she looks at shirin with pleading eyes.
6723,inside,she grabs the three cookies wrapped in a tissue and crushes them inside the pocket.
6724,where,"i wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to you.” walking away, she says, “we probably  223  dalia sofer  shouldn’t spend so much time together anymore.” she heads to the opposite side of the courtyard, where she stands and watches the soccer game, alone."
6725,inside,"when she was younger, she would trap flies inside transparent plastic bags and watch them as they suffocated slowly—over three or four days."
6726,where,“you forget where you are.” “that was close!” parviz says when she is gone.
6727,where,i am at that point in my life where the days ahead of me are fewer than those behind.
6728,where,it is a city where circles are rare.
6729,confinement,"in his mind he traces halos, rings, wheels of fortune, clocks—all instruments of confinement on the one hand, and hope on the other."
6730,inside,"around three in the morning, on his way back to the  228  the septembers of shiraz  bridge, he passes through the fulton fish market, watches the delivery vans, the stacked crates, and the fishmongers, their faces covered with soot, warming their hands over small fires that burn inside trash cans, haggling with their customers."
6731,locked,i brought him to the house but she locked herself in the bathroom.
6732,war,"but maybe in your haze of hashish you’ve missed the war, kazem-agha.” a few men chuckle."
6733,where,“this country is no good anymore.” “where will you go?
6734,where,"“we’ll be going to geneva, where my parents are."
6735,escaped,friends of mine who escaped a few months ago referred me to a couple of men with a good reputation.
6736,killing,"walking past the shopkeepers standing in their doorways and killing the morning in gossipy clusters, she remembers shahla and keyvan’s wedding, that lavish affair at the villa of keyvan’s parents."
6737,where,"for a while she says nothing, allowing herself to linger  234  the septembers of shiraz  in his world, where isaac has not disappeared but has simply forgotten his shoes."
6738,where,"“let me pick them up while i’m here.” she follows him inside the shop, where rows of shoes hang from their heels on metal rods along the walls."
6739,cell,the cell is cold.
6740,inside,"he tries to remove the insects trapped inside, but they are stubborn and stick to the weave."
6741,death,"“a five of cups,” she said in her broken english, then, “ay, dios mio, la tarjeta de la muerte también, el número trece—the death card, señor.” the cards—one depicting a stooped man draped in black, the other a skeletal figure in medieval armor on a white horse, terrified him."
6742,where,"he sat still, losing his breath in the small room, the hot andalusian night weighing down the red velvet curtains and seeping through the arabesques of the railing of the mezzanine, where, upon entering, he had seen a little albino girl surveying the customers below."
6743,death,“la tarjeta de muerte does not mean actual death.
6744,where,"/ where is the preacher’s holy monody, where is the lute?” he would welcome these unannounced visits, allow the verse to tickle him like the memory of an adolescent crush, then shoo it away from his mind with the documents before him, waiting to be signed."
6745,cell,"the prison is calm tonight—no rattle of locks, no footsteps in the courtyard, no sound of a little boy running up and down the stairs above his cell."
6746,where,“where?” he manages to say.
6747,where,“where?
6748,cell,"where?” they drag his body out of the cell and through the dark corridor, lit only by the flashlight of the leading guard."
6749,guard,"“i am not well.” “that does not matter much now,” the lead guard says."
6750,wall,"dragged to the end of the courtyard, he is told to face the wall and lift both arms in the air."
6751,guard,“allah-o-akbar!” a guard shouts.
6752,wall,"isaac hears the sound of boots crushing snow, the pull of a trigger, then the firing of a bullet which bounces against the wall and falls on the snow, followed by another, then another."
6753,guard,“that’s enough!” a guard yells.
6754,wall,"when the last bullet bounces off the wall he listens, disbelieving, to the silence around him."
6755,wall,"“let this vermin sit in his own shit and recognize what he is up against.” he falls on the snow, facing the wall, afraid to face anything but this wall."
6756,cell,"lying on the ice, he thinks of the warm mattress in his cell."
6757,war,"at a newsstand she reads the headline, “hundreds of martyrs killed in the shatt-al-arab.” in school that morning they had discussed the war, the teacher beginning the class by hanging posters of soldiers, some of them children, on the walls."
6758,war,i think i would.” when the bell rang the teacher announced that those who had volunteered to go to war—even though the question had been hypothetical—would be excused from homework.
6759,war,"she knew that they were not supposed to talk, but the idea of leila going to war terrified her."
6760,gate,"she stands by the gate and peeks in at the garden—the  244  the septembers of shiraz  accumulated snow, stained yellow with the dog’s urine, and the jagged teeth of icicles hanging from the swimming pool’s edge."
6761,gate,the dog runs to her and sticks her muzzle through the gate.
6762,sink,"each time he drifts back into sleep the leaking faucet interrupts him, the drops loud and defiant, so he wakes up and lies still, watching the objects around him—the sink, his shoes, which he has not worn since the lashings, the koran, still open to the page he last read—all of which slowly merge with the objects of the many rooms he has slept in throughout his life."
6763,where,"drifting in and out of sleep he sees the muslin curtains of his room in shiraz where he spent so many summers reading and writ-  w  the septembers of shiraz  ing, the porcelain pitcher on the night table in the french countryside, the mints left like anonymous letters on his pillow in geneva, the jade buddha in tokyo, the dragon painted on the ceiling in hong kong, his bed at home, in which he fell asleep wrapped in his comforter, the hair on his arm brushed by his wife’s breath, and the hemp sheets of his boyhood home, rough against his skin, not unlike the burlap blanket covering him now."
6764,toilet,"he understands now the scribbles on monuments and sidewalks, even in toilet stalls—a name and a date inscribed for future visitors, a sorry attempt to communicate with people of another era, to say to them, i once was."
6765,where,he is led down the stairs to the same  247  dalia sofer  room where he last saw his interrogator.
6766,where,"my daughter, with her closet full of shoes, has no idea where her father is."
6767,power,"‘the power of abū lahab will perish, and he will perish."
6768,interrogation,"playing and replaying in his mind his next interrogation—which he believed would be his last—he had come to the conclusion that with a man like mohsen, one had to take risks."
6769,where,"“i see that you have been using your time wisely.” he looks down at his hand, at the space where his finger should have been."
6770,cell,i hear a boy run up and down the stairs above my cell.
6771,case,"“you’re a tough case,” he says finally."
6772,cell,"i need a more specific answer.” “my entire savings.”  in the cell a guard forces isaac’s feet into his shoes, the  leather unable to expand enough to accommodate the swelling."
6773,guard,"in the  250  the septembers of shiraz  hallway a masked guard rushes to him, and says, in a voice that he recognizes as hossein’s, “brother amin!"
6774,guard,are you being released?” “let’s go!” the other guard yells.
6775,taken,"“move!” he is taken up the stairs and through a metal gate, then dragged across the courtyard—the same path he traveled the night of ramin’s and vartan’s executions."
6776,gate,another gate rattles open and he is shoved inside a car.
6777,guard,"seated by the window, he realizes that the handkerchief, hastily tied, has left him a sliver of vision, and looking down he sees his own deformed feet, then the black boots of the guard, next to him."
6778,interrogation,"it had shifted the tone of the interrogation, turning it into a conversation."
6779,prisons,"to build more prisons, to buy more bullets?"
6780,death,"in buying back my own life, will i facilitate the death of others?"
6781,where,“ where is your bank?” the driver asks.
6782,inside,"the guard seated next to him is biting his lips, his mouth contorting to the left and right as his teeth mutilate the thin layer of skin inside."
6783,gate,"when they arrive the gate is open, so the car rolls in with ease, and parks behind farnaz’s car."
6784,guard,"“make it shut up!” the guard says, his rifle pointed at her."
6785,arrest,for the first time since his arrest he feels tears forming in his eyes.
6786,guard,253  dalia sofer  “save the hugs for later!” the guard says.
6787,where,"isaac enters the foyer, where the smell of laundry detergent and freshly brewed tea remind him of the life that he may yet live."
6788,guard,"the guard follows close behind and farnaz, by isaac’s side, stares at his feet, holding back her questions."
6789,where,in his study he finds that nothing is where he left it.
6790,where,"“my passport, farnazjan, where is it?” “the passports were confiscated,” she says."
6791,where,"but i’m not sure where it is.” “brother,” isaac says to the guard."
6792,guard,"it must be here somewhere.” “i don’t have all day,” snaps the guard."
6793,wall,"he walks around the room, his rifle pointed upward, and examines the books on the shelves, the photographs, the sword collection on the wall."
6794,where,"“where did you get these?” he says, pointing at the swords with his rifle."
6795,guard,"the guard moves in on a sword, runs his free hand over the gold engravings on the handle."
6796,wall,"isaac removes the sword, which has left a half-moon imprint on the wall, like a smile."
6797,guard,"“look at all the engravings on the handle, brother,” he says, distracting the guard as long as he can."
6798,awaiting,"“this one dates from the period of genghis khan.” the guard rests his rifle between his legs and holds out his hands, palms upward, like a pilgrim awaiting blessing."
6799,guard,"isaac carefully places the sword into them, and steps back, allowing the guard to lose himself in the object."
6800,guard,"the guard rests the sword’s glistening tip on farnaz’s neck, pressing lightly."
6801,guard,"“please, brother, just another minute,” he says to the guard."
6802,where,"“and then, wait!” she lets go of isaac’s hand and walks to a corner, where stacks of files and papers are piled up high."
6803,guard,we’ve wasted enough time.” the guard takes the rifle in one hand and the sword in the other.
6804,freedom,"let me tell you something.” he leans forward and whispers in isaac’s ear, “don’t relish your freedom just yet."
6805,guard,"sandwiched between the driver and the guard, he walks to the desk of fariborz jamshidi, his old friend."
6806,guard,"what happened—” he examines the guard then the driver, then isaac again."
6807,guard,"“you heard the man, brother!” says the guard."
6808,where,"“yes, right away.” fariborz takes the papers and retreats in the back, where several other bankers have already gathered, surveying the scene."
6809,guard,"his banker returns with five bulging canvas bags, which he places by the guard’s feet."
6810,guard,"“good,” the guard says, his eyes gleaming the way they had back at the house, as he held the gilded sword."
6811,guard,257  dalia sofer  “aren’t you getting in the car?” the guard says.
6812,guard,i’ll manage from here.” “as you wish.” the guard rests his hand on the car handle.
6813,cell,the stains on his clothes are much more visible here in daylight than they had been in the dim light of his cell.
6814,inside,"he remembers how as a boy he would stand in front of the movie theater, his handme-down pants too large and his pockets empty, and wait for ahmad-agha, who would pass by the theater yelling “shahre farang—foreign city!” on his back the old man would carry an ornate metal box, inside of which were three-dimensional images of distant places—of a medieval castle in england or a parisian café on a summer afternoon—places far away from the bare street in which he stood."
6815,sink,"just a quick shower.” bent over the sink, he avoids his reflection in the mirror but glances at it periodically, like a motorist peeking at the gruesome remains of a roadside accident."
6816,toilet,"he walks to the toilet and sits, fully clothed."
6817,where,"so many times she had fantasized about isaac’s return, but none of her mind’s creations resembled this tired afternoon, where a cold light moves on half-empty plates, and she finds herself alone in the kitchen, separated from him by the walls and endless corridors of the house."
6818,killing,"while her parents would oblige them, her mother would refuse to watch the killing, and would forbid shirin to witness it also."
6819,wall,"by the meal’s end some candles continue to burn calmly  while others flicker wildly, casting stormy reflections on the opposite wall before guttering out."
6820,guilt,guilt was brewing in him but he suppressed it; he had not felt this good in a very long time.
6821,inside,her hand inside his filled him with longing.
6822,stir,he had never thought that a mere hand could stir so much.
6823,where,"“where’s zalman?” she says sharply, as though she were offended to find parviz there instead of the owner."
6824,where,"“here.” parviz retreats to the back, where rows of black hats stare at him with the dark, purposeful eyes of their future  272  the septembers of shiraz  owners."
6825,where,"not finding the exact size of the grandson—this accomplished boy of eighteen who has already found himself a wife and is on his way to save the jews of los angeles—he goes down to the basement, where he knows zalman keeps all the unusual sizes."
6826,inside,"curious, he opens it, and finds a heap of letters inside, with the careful, scripted handwriting of a different time."
6827,where,"lights are coming on in living rooms, where families are gathering, fitting their day inside a single dinner hour before retreating for the evening, so much left unsaid."
6828,inside,the yellow-edged letters are scattered inside in no particular order.
6829,taken,parviz wonders how long it had taken mr. mendelson to forget about nadia.
6830,guilt,"guilt overwhelms him, and he wonders if he has already become for rachel what nadia has been for zalman—a sad transgression."
6831,executed,"sitting here, in the melancholy smallness of the studio, the executed singer’s voice filling the room, parviz remembers, suddenly, how in the summertime his whole family would bring mattresses onto the terrace and sleep under scores of stars, a vast, black night surrounding them."
6832,inside,"he lies awake, stares at the red lava lamp on the table next to him, the crescents—anemic blood cells—swimming inside it."
6833,arrest,"his files are scattered everywhere, the calendar still open to the date of his arrest, the scribbled appointments now infused with the knowledge that they would never be met."
6834,where,"even the glass of tea is where he left it, filled now with greenish layers of fungus."
6835,where,"he thanks god now for the banks dotting the rhône in geneva, where he had had the wisdom to wire money over the years, knowing, as many before him had known, that a jew should not leave all his eggs in one basket, even if that basket happens to be his own beloved country."
6836,taken,"of his sixteen employees, only farhad, his best stonecutter, had taken his call and offered to come in."
6837,cell,"he dismisses the sound as an illusion, an echo of mohsen’s little boy running above his cell."
6838,where,"he walks through the empty corridors and goes upstairs, where he finds morteza sitting on the floor, a heap of papers in front of him."
6839,taken,i was trying to figure out what was taken from you amin-agha.
6840,thief,"you are a thief.”  282  the septembers of shiraz  “me, a thief ?"
6841,pen,"you have a light hand, which i am sure will make countless women feel like empresses in their own right.’” one of the first pieces issac ever designed was this pen-  283  dalia sofer  dant for the empress."
6842,locked,"having served two years in paris as an apprentice to a jeweler, he had returned to tehran, locked himself in his dark studio for five months, cutting and polishing stones, combining them to form a pendant inspired by a chinese temple."
6843,death,"“this piece of paper, my dear amin-agha, is your death certificate."
6844,where,where is it?
6845,state,"precious stones were accidental secretions of the earth—of volcanic eruptions and sedimentation—yet nearly all of them possessed a perfect internal order, called crystalline state—manifested by a regular arrangement of atoms repeated one hundred million times per centimeter."
6846,where,"but as he reached the café where farnaz sat with her espresso, waiting for him in her sundress, her shoulders rubbed that morning with sunscreen lotion, smelling of the ocean and the many summers they would yet spend together, he wondered if this diamond should be for her."
6847,thief,"all it would take to get you in trouble would be a phone call from me, informing them of all the additional items that i would have liked to donate to the cause of the revolution had they not been stolen by a small-time thief called morteza."
6848,execution,"the last time he had felt a pain like this, on the day he learned of kourosh’s execution, he had released it in the grinding sound of the stonecutting machines and the buzzing activity around him."
6849,sink,"288  forty -on e  saac brings the scissors to his chin and clips off his beard, the white, coarse hairs falling into the sink."
6850,where,"he recoils at the transformation of a once handsome man: two craters have formed on each side of his face where his chin and jaw intersect, and his brown eyes seem lost inside deep, gray sockets."
6851,where,"he leans across the bed, managing no more than a kiss on her shoulder, which she acknowledges by placing her hand where his lips had been."
6852,death,"did you talk to him?” “yes, we ended up in the same block.” he considers telling her about his death, but decides not to."
6853,where,“where is mother?” he asks.
6854,war,"much of his interaction with his father was like this: an unspoken war, a mutual dislike, broken only occasionally, when his father would come home with a deflated ball he had found on the street, or an amputated doll—crippled presents but presents nonetheless, which made isaac and the others run to him  294  the septembers of shiraz  and kiss his hand."
6855,inside,"by the time they arrived the doors had been shut, the audience inside erupting into cheers and applause."
6856,taken,"looking now at his father, he sees not the despot he had known but an injured old man, softened by illness, still mourning the loss of his mother, who was taken from him when he was just a boy."
6857,wall,"that’s isaac amin, the man who polished his way out of misery but in the end lost it all.”  296  fort y -t wo  eclining against the wall and hugging one knee, the boyish man sits on the floor and sips his tea, closing his eyes every now and then, as though he were just succumbing to a narcotic."
6858,taken,"use bleach to erase the names and dates.” sipping his tea he says, “we’ve taken many people across the border, sarkar."
6859,case,and you’ll need cash in case we get caught.
6860,police,the border police on both sides are vigilant but easily bought.
6861,where,"in the furtive atmosphere of the smugglers’ apartment, where the curtains are closed and tapestry-covered pillows line the walls, she has let her scarf slip down to her neck, maybe in anticipation of freedom."
6862,where,"you will arrange a ride from tehran to tabriz, where you’ll have lunch."
6863,arrested,suppose you get arrested again between now and when we leave.
6864,police,"there are so many factors: the weather, the people patrolling the border on any  299  dalia sofer  given night, encounters with snakes and foxes, the turkish police on the other side—i could go on and on ."
6865,where,"for the little girl the fee would be forty-five thousand, if you want us to guarantee that should something happen to both of you we would arrange for her to join relatives somewhere.” “her brother is in new york.” “then that’s where we would send her."
6866,guard,farnaz flashes him the same terrified look she had when the guard had held the sword to her throat and she couldn’t find the birth certificate.
6867,where,"they had just arrived at their beach house, where they liked to spend the holidays, and he remembers the scent of humid cedar rising from the wooden beams of the ceiling and fusing with the smell of cooking—which would begin as a single note of caramelizing onions and would expand as the hours progressed, becoming an orchestra of scents—of meats, spices, and herbs."
6868,war,"but when the lights went out—another blackout, so frequent in the early days of the war—he hurried in the dark to the dining room console for a candle, knocking against the mirror along the way."
6869,conviction,"her doggedness irritated him, but not because he found her conviction ridiculous."
6870,where,"the warmth of her hand comforts him now, and he tells  himself that maybe things will turn out all right: they will leave the country and start over in a new place, together with the children, in a matchbox apartment in a manhattan high-rise or in an anonymous clapboard house in an american suburb, where people will mispronounce their names and where they will eventually stop correcting them, laughing instead at the botched words."
6871,pen,"at night he lays out his tools on the dining room table:  303  dalia sofer  bleach, cotton balls, toothpicks, a fountain pen, paper, and the passport."
6872,taken,"tomorrow they will have a family picture taken, to replace his daughter’s photograph, taken a few years earlier, when her front baby tooth had just fallen out."
6873,where,"he sees her now, lifting the pillow the following morning and finding the tooth still wrapped in its tissue, where she left it."
6874,where,"304  forty -t hr ee  n the car, on the way to the caspian, where they will spend the week-long spring vacation, her parents tell her of their planned departure."
6875,arrested,will all three of them get arrested this time and get sent to prison?
6876,war,"if they go to war, why not prison?"
6877,guilt,"yet it is not sadness she feels, but an emptiness, a certain guilt even, for not feeling sad enough."
6878,question,"why do you need another one?” “brother, what kind of a question is that?” “a serious one."
6879,guilt,"since the incident with rachel, his guilt amplifies whenever he is in zalman’s  a  dalia sofer  presence."
6880,locked,"eat!” music comes on, a joyful european jewish tune that sends the men dancing in a circle, their arms locked around one another, their feet kicking the air in tandem."
6881,wall,"zalman and a younger, slimmer version of himself, a brother, parviz realizes, walk to the rabbi, each carrying one of the swaddled infants on a white pillow, while rivka, looking pale, waits for them, leaning on the wall behind the rabbi."
6882,taken,"afterward the twins, exhausted from their ordeal, are taken to a bedroom along with their mother."
6883,inside,it’s cooler here than inside.” she wipes her forehead with a tissue.
6884,where,"“i wish it would rain already.” in the garden of his parents’ home, where cypresses offer him some relief from the heat wave that has been choking the city for two weeks, he watches the cigarette smoke exit his nostrils and slowly merge with the oppressive air."
6885,inside,"“we should go inside, isaac-jan,” she says."
6886,where,"and where would it go, this water, since i can’t pump anything out?"
6887,death,"since the end has been determined, it is the waiting that seems intolerable to him, each interminable minute infused with the possibility of death, yet passing uneventfully."
6888,where,"farnaz reads the letter twice before running to the bedroom, where isaac is placing a handful of gemstones in a pouch."
6889,sink,"“i do need to yell, because i can’t take it anymore!” hunched over the sink, he looks at his wet face in the mirror."
6890,sink,"she watches him, still hunched over the sink, looking down."
6891,death,"she realizes that her husband will from now on have the monopoly on grief, for the simple, inarguable fact that he has been in prison, that he has faced death, many times over, and has seen and heard others die."
6892,execution,"she hears him crying now, the way he had the night he heard of kourosh nassiri’s execution."
6893,inside,"everyone’s story must come to an end, she knows, but to prepare for the end, as they have—to liquidate one’s belongings and sign over the deed to one’s house—is not unlike selecting a casket, lying in it voluntarily, and shutting it from inside."
6894,inside,"and when he started protesting, they blindfolded him and took him away in a van.”  321  dalia sofer  she peers inside the shop through the glass."
6895,where,"like them, the antiques dealer may one day cross the border, and show up in america, where he may look for them, or in paris, where he may run into javad at a sidewalk café."
6896,sink,"this morning he washed and dressed as usual, leaving his pajamas on the bedpost, his towel on the rack behind the bathroom door, his razor on the sink."
6897,charge,"charge: smuggling vodka into the country, an advocate of indecency."
6898,arrest,under it is a log of the  324  the septembers of shiraz  many attempts to arrest him.
6899,where,"now the poor girl is in prison, no one knows where."
6900,authorities,"i thought, what if someone, maybe the new owner of this house, finds these files and alerts the authorities?"
6901,authorities,and i have to tell you something else: morteza wanted to send to the authorities some letter that the empress had written you.
6902,wall,"but you were my family—you, farnazkhanoum, and the children.” she looks out the window, then at the clock on the wall, about to strike five."
6903,sink,"he finishes his tea, leaving the empty glass in the sink as usual, and as he is about to walk away he glances at it, at this hourglass-shaped kamar barik that he bought with farnaz soon after their marriage."
6904,arrest,just a week ago was the anniversary of his arrest.
6905,power,"passing through the town of qazvin, the seat of power of the seljuk dynasty in the eleventh century, and three centuries later, that of the safavids, he sees the square with its loggia of colonnades and thinks of the countless hands that had governed the country, some generous, others despotic— all ephemeral."
6906,where,"they abandon their car near the restaurant and walk to the blue mosque, where they are to meet two men in a black car."
6907,where,where did you leave your car?” “we abandoned it on the street.
6908,where,"“you, in the back!” he climbs in the back, where he carves for himself a spot to sit."
6909,guilt,"why is it, he wonders, that wealth must always be accompanied by guilt, if not shame?"
6910,inside,"had it not ensured his family’s comfort, as it does now—his wife and daughter the only ones of the group seated safely inside the truck?"
6911,inside,"inside a few people are seated on the floor, filling their plates from platters of rice and potato stew."
6912,question,"“yes, first and last, i hope,” isaac says, taken aback by the question."
6913,freedom,just desperate.”  333  dalia sofer  “what happened when you got caught?” “money bought my freedom.
6914,charge,"he wonders if, by renouncing his old life, he has also surrendered his old self: he is no longer the one in charge."
6915,where,"isaac thinks of the cities ahead of him—ankara, istanbul, geneva, new york—and of the cities behind him—tehran, where his home stands, empty now of life; ramsar by the caspian, its air filled with fog; isfahan, with its domes of blue; yazd, where brick alleys shelter its inhabitants from the daytime heat and nighttime freeze of the desert, and where the undying flame of the zoroastrians burns in a small urn of oil; and his beloved shiraz, the city of his youthful summers, where he discovered both poetry and farnaz, and where, along the mausoleums of the medieval poets hāfez and sa’di, he recited verses, finding his future in them."
6916,poverty,"occasionally passersby would see him with his books and ask him for a hāfez oracle, and isaac, who in his younger days  336  the septembers of shiraz  believed in such divination, would oblige them: “what’s on your mind?” he would ask, and people would say, “my sick mother, my dying father, my dreadful job, my poverty, my dead-end marriage.” it was usually the dejected who sought divination."
6917,question,"he would open the divan of hāfez for them, and the first verse that would catch their eye was believed to hold in its letters the answer to their question: “the wheel of fortune is a marvelous thing: / what next proud head to the lowly dust will it bring?” or “not all the sum of earthly happiness / is worth the bowed head of a moment’s pain.” come september he would pack his bags and head back north to tehran, knowing that in eight months he would return."
6918,where,"a few hours later a truck carries them from the village to ankara, where they wait for a bus to istanbul."
6919,pen,"many thanks to lucy rosenthal, whose early encouragement drove me to pick up the pen (those morning workshops in the hills of umbria have left behind an indelible imprint) and to melvin bukiet, joan silber, and sheila kohler, who offered me their generous advice as i began this book."
6920,imprisonment,"thanks also to the photographer abbas, whose powerful images of iran offered me great inspiration, to simin habibian for her book, 1001 persian-english proverbs, and to the many political prisoners whose candid accounts provided me with the painful details of imprisonment and torture: specifically, i am indebted to hassan darvish, monireh baradaran, and my own dear father, simon sofer."
6921,wall,"her stories and essays have been published in the o. henry prize stories, best american short stories, the new york times, guardian, wall street journal, granta and many other publications."
6922,power,"– geert wilders, message to refugees, 2015 to make someone wait: the constant prerogative of all power, ‘age-old pastime of humanity’."
6923,camp,kaweh and kambiz part two: camp i. ii.
6924,illegal,our word then was ‘illegal’.
6925,illegal,"even now, in the casual talk of refugees and lawyers, the word i hear is ‘illegal’."
6926,illegal,"there, we were illegal: all the same dizzying displacement, uncertainty and need, but we had to find our own shelter."
6927,state,"without a state to say, ‘yes, we will be responsible for you,’ we were so unmoored it was hard to fathom a next step."
6928,camp,"we had been told that we’d be taken to ‘a good refugee camp’, a temporary safe space for transients seeking asylum outside italy."
6929,building,"the italian government had leased this building to house the likes of us, political and religious asylum seekers and passers-through with particular need: elderly family, children."
6930,where,"we sat on our bed and wondered where we’d get money, if we’d find friends among our neighbours."
6931,camp,"despite its grand skeleton, hotel barba was a refugee camp and we had to stay put, as we had no status in italy."
6932,state,"in the absence of work or school, all we did was dream, a maddening state, and battle loneliness."
6933,inside,"i was beginning to understand other things, too, to peek out from inside my own skin."
6934,camp,"in a refugee camp, stories are everything."
6935,power,our stories were drumming with power.
6936,camp,"we had created our life’s great story; next would come the waiting time, camp, where we would tell it."
6937,death,"by college, half my life had led up to our escape and the other half was spent reliving it, in churches and retreats where my mother made it a hagiographic journey, on college applications where it was a plea, at sleepovers where it was entertainment and in discussion groups after public viewings of xenophobic melodramas like china cry and not without my daughter, films about christian women facing death and escaping to america."
6938,inside,a glass enclosure shot up through our living room and inside that was a tree.
6939,inside,"i had a tree inside my house; i had the papery hands of morvarid, my friend and nanny, a ninety-yearold village woman; i had my grandmother’s fruit leather and hotel koorosh schnitzels and sour cherries and orchards and a farm – life in iran was a fairytale."
6940,thief,"you are a carpetbagger, an opportunist, a thief."
6941,question,my mother didn’t think to question people’s hardwired distinctions.
6942,question,"she fended off that question by telling our story: she was almost murdered by the regime, so she shouldn’t have to deal with people’s prejudices."
6943,tortured,"a tortured mind, terror of a wasted future, is what enables you to abandon home, it’s a prerequisite for stepping into a dinghy, for braving militarised mountains."
6944,dictatorship,"no one who has lived under a dictatorship, who has scooped up their children and run to a bomb shelter, doubts the fear."
6945,where,where is the humility?
6946,where,and what is a credible danger in a country that hangs apostates and homosexuals and adulterers and where a hateful finger in your direction is enough to make you one?
6947,where,"a country where record keeping is a farce; where, in whispers, the land’s riches are divided among a few; where young men languish without work; where young women wither with unspent ambition and desire; where the enchanting whisper of opium is always in your ear and despair fills your lungs so thickly that your best chance is to be your own executioner?"
6948,war,"with the iraq war over, their plight is often considered insufficient."
6949,death,"they endure painful transformation, rising from death, discarding their faces and bodies, their identities, without guarantee of new ones."

6951,police,each week we check into the local police headquarters.
6952,justice,"but you didn’t, so you have no reason to fear.’  the assumption of the office isn’t just thoroughness and justice on the part of the iranian government (laughable), but also infallibility."
6953,serving,"how is one to honestly navigate such a dishonest, self-serving system?"
6954,murder,"it is a plunge into fog, a burning of an old life, a murder of a previous self."
6955,jailed,"and so, i’ve left out the story of the syrian man i met in berlin who floated with a child for seven hours then found himself cleaning a slave ship, or the jailed scholars or activists who are hit with public fatwas – even your everyday trumpian admits that those guys deserve rescue."
6956,authorities,"though the truth of these stories struck me hard, i know that i, a writer, was peeking in different corners than the authorities."
6957,where,"in the meantime, where is the lie?"

6962,taken,"good luck.’ in the turkish village, he was driven to a mud hut and taken for twice the agreed fee."
6963,stir,"‘the journey was more treacherous than expected.’ he recalled no hardship that hadn’t been explained before the trip, but single young men from iran rarely stir up sympathy – economic migrants, exploiters, opportunists."
6964,awaiting,"he sat in the hut for four days, awaiting the next step, though this one was already disappearing into the dark patches, the spoiled, battered parts of his brain."
6965,jail,"darius ran into the woods, where turkish officers picked him up and took him to jail."
6966,jail,he wasted away in a turkish jail cell for two months.
6967,where,"this is where the hardship really starts.’ ‘we’re in europe,’ said darius, to the dark."
6968,war,"the itch in my brain arrived as war was leaking into our everyday – sirens, rations, adults huddled around radios."
6969,camp,it wasn’t the side effect of this blistering morning at the abu dhabi united nations office or that aimless month in an italian resettlement camp.
6970,where,"even in ardestoon, my father’s village, where i tiptoed with my cousins along a riverbank, picked green plums in leafy orchards and hiked in mountains, the itch endured."
6971,inside,it made me colour inside the lines.
6972,disaster,"at school, my scarf was lopsided and my handwriting a disaster, but my math was perfect."

6974,wall,they taped weekly class rankings to the grey cement wall outside the classroom window.
6975,wall,every week twenty girls rushed that wall.
6976,wall,"but that meant facing the rankings, and if you turned another way you had the nightmarish khomeini mural and, on the fourth wall, the enormous bloody martyr fist (and rose)."
6977,sentences,"she had fallen three sentences behind in the dictée and given up, not just on the test, but on the whole business of civilisation."
6978,murder,"what a quick, uncomplicated solution, to go feral: to sit there, leaking, waiting to be dragged out by a murder of islamic republic schoolteachers, listening for the snap and swish of the principal’s chador down the hall."
6979,where,"at day’s end, i took the short way home, down alleyways lined with drainage gutters where live fish travelled the old city."
6980,inside,"i lifted the lid of my desk and slipped the book inside next to my pencils and the tamarind packet i had squeezed from a corner and rolled shut, like toothpaste."
6981,abuse,"baba may have remained respected and generous and muslim, but that wasn’t enough to protect me from abuse when i declared myself maman’s ally."
6982,toilet,"they would pull me aside, to a bench between the toilet cave and the nightmarish khomeini mural and they would ask this again and again."
6983,police,"we endured random arrests, executions, morality police roving the streets for sinful women (gashte-ershad or ‘guidance patrol’, they called it)."
6984,where,"later in life, far from isfahan, i would meet kindhearted muslims and learn that i had been shown half a picture: that all villainy starts on native soil, where rotten people can safely be rotten, where government exists for their protection."
6985,guard,"a guard picked up babaeejoon, a beloved stuffed sheep, and turned him over in his hand."
6986,death,"‘they have to check so bad people don’t smuggle things.’ though babaeejoon had been my gift after tonsil surgery, his death became my brother’s trauma, because at the time of his disembowelment, babaeejoon was khosrou’s sheep."
6987,freedom,she told me about jesus and love and freedom and i believed.
6988,wall,"every night, i heard baba shouting through the wall."

6991,where,i felt my breath changing and climbing to the top of my throat where it grew quick and shallow.
6992,gang,"maybe i would have collected enough english words by then to keep that gang of blond boys from tormenting me every day, from punching me in the stomach, from grabbing my ponytail at lunch."
6993,where,where are your hammams?
6994,toilet,why do you bathe next to the toilet?
6995,toilet,on a toilet?
6996,illegal,"now we were converts in the islamic republic, illegal christians in an underground church."

6998,where,"we taped our windows and ran to basements, where we chatted in the dark with our neighbours."
6999,police,"she broadcast her story over an illegal christian radio station, tucked tracts into women’s chadors under the nose of the morality police and did everything a person could do to draw attention to her apostasy."

7008,war,"in war, villainy and good change hands all the time, like a football."
7009,officers,"he shouted a few more times, gave maman a warning and returned to the other officers watching us from their car."
7010,where,"i wonder if she imagined herself in a country where men are punished for such things, where women can defend themselves."
7011,wall,"‘where did you get that sweet nurse’s costume?’ she meant my photo hanging across an entire wall of baba’s waiting room, my finger to my lips."
7012,power,"a good scrub would cost her another twenty and all her power, returning her by morning to old ms yadolai."

7023,gate,a hard knock shook the metal gate outside.
7024,gate,i’ll protect you!’ brother yusuf had hardly opened the gate before baba rushed in and grabbed him by the throat.

7028,death,"was there any way to escape hell if i led a schoolyard full of girls in chanting death to israel, god’s own people?"
7029,gate,"i separated from my body with each step and by the time i passed through the school gate, crossed the blacktop and climbed the podium, i was numb and limp, hovering outside myself."
7030,war,"it took months to escape the nausea of that morning and even then, i was marked: long after the islamic republic, the war and the refugee years had receded and i had become an ordinary american, i would still be someone who once stood on a podium in an isfahani schoolyard and shouted death to america into a bullhorn."

7037,where,"on fridays in ardestoon, reza would put me on the back of his motorcycle and we would whiz through the countryside, past rivers with ducks and orchards full of sour cherries, mulberries, almonds and green  plums, to a mountain where sheep grazed."
7038,freedom,"it was freedom, my hair flying as i clutched his stomach and screamed into his shoulder."
7039,sentences,".’ after three years of iranian dictée, after khadijeh, i divided tests into two kinds: the easy kind and the kind with a chadori teacher breathing down your neck, shouting sentences that must be written verbatim in calligraphy, with a fountain pen."
7040,arrest,a lucky crack had opened in maman’s house arrest; i held my favourite uncle’s hand for the last time and we ran through it.
7041,where,"the street was deserted, just a long sun-streaked hollow where i played with the neighbourhood children."
7042,where,"we would fly to tehran, then drive to karaj, where we could hide in the home of maman’s elderly grandmother (moti’s mother)."
7043,wall,"she had pillows lining a wall beside a small television, a bed-ridden husband and cherry trees that would be blossoming now."

7047,charge,"in the west, the criminals wouldn’t be in charge."
7048,prisoner,"somehow, though, either before we left or as we drove, baba’s phone connected to a friend: maybe a village classmate, or a fellow prisoner, or a guest at his hookah, or most likely, a patient relieved of pain."
7049,police,"as it approached, the olive of a police vehicle stained the horizon and maman began to pray."
7050,authority,"he was no showman like baba, but at twenty-one, he was charming enough to befriend a police officer who hadn’t bothered to speak to any central authority that morning."
7051,where,"baba was slumped behind his desk, puffing smoke into the darkness, thinking of how to get us out without exit visas or passports, in a country where even plane tickets took months to secure."
7052,where,"he must be good.’ just before hanging up, baba asked, ‘where do you work, agha?’ the man said he worked at the passport office."
7053,fugitive,"and the route through turkey seemed more dangerous, more the fugitive’s way."
7054,where,"fate, though, spit them out at two ends of a long spectrum, two extremes so distant that one wonders how civilised societies allow a single hour, or day, to carry such consequences (where is our humility?)."
7055,where,"i am drawn to the place where their stories diverge, the vital hinge where one man is believed and the other is not, this weighing station of human worth operated for profit by winners of a great lottery of birth."
7056,law,"and yet, the law required them to speak only in farsi in school, at the bank and other places of business."

7059,arrested,"he had seen preparations of the crane and the gallows, the public announcement: ‘we have arrested so-and-so, a traitor."

7064,where,‘where is the competition?’ his mother asked at dinner.
7065,where,"if kaweh was in the front part of a westfacing cat’s neck, then kambiz was on its back, due east, in shomal where people came to hike and ski the alborz, or swim and eat fish from the caspian sea."
7066,law,his mother had spent her life competing with her sister-in-law.
7067,law,don’t shame me in front of my sister-in-law.’ kambiz thought maybe he’d become an electrical engineer.
7068,where,"sometimes, he stared at his mother’s spices and thought, ‘why is it so low a calling to create pleasure out of chicken thighs and a basketful of ground-up roots?’  at the border, a man told kaweh and sattar where to go, what iraqi village to aim for and where to find the kdpi (they were headquartered in koy sanjaq)."
7069,arrested,at the first stop their bus was boarded by peshmerga officers and kaweh was arrested.

7074,officers,"finally he said, ‘these are iranian intelligence officers."
7075,taken,someone would let her in and arrange for her to be taken back.

7077,authorities,"he was granted refugee status by unhcr, who believed that, while iraqi kurdistan was safe, iranian authorities wanted kaweh."
7078,authority,but the turkish authority refused to recognise him or to honour unhcr’s decision.
7079,authorities,"then one day, the iranian authorities called him in turkey."
7080,where,"‘we know where you are,’ they said."
7081,kidnapping,he began to fear kidnapping or deportation.
7082,arrested,"police often arrested asylum seekers on the streets, handed them to iranian authorities or left them on the mountain at the mercy of smugglers, stray bullets and the elements."

7085,officers,"the officers took their money, their phones, anything of value."

7096,camp,"he went to asylum offices in the village of ter apel, to which all asylum seekers are required to report, and said, ‘i am a refugee.’  part two camp  (on waiting and in-between places)  i.  o  n the plane out of iran, all we did was marvel in whispers about what we had just done."
7097,illegal,"or worse, illegal immigrants."
7098,authorities,"the day after we landed, maman requested european asylum from the united nations office in abu dhabi and hoped for a response before our visas ran out and the emirati immigration authorities found out we had blown through our welcome."
7099,where,"‘it smells,’ i moaned into maman’s lap in the hot, sweaty car ride to sharjah, the city outside dubai where we were to settle."
7100,inside,"unfamiliar smells made me crazy, but i was learning how to alter them with pleasant mental associations, an early hint of how much i could change, if i really focused, inside my faulty, itchy mind, which maman playfully compared to morvarid and other grumbling old village women i had loved."
7101,cell,"i hated our building, a smoky industrial stack of studio apartments with paper-thin walls, a lobby encased in glass like a holding cell, where the manager, a korean student, sat watching television all day."
7102,where,"when we were alone, he would ask me things i couldn’t fathom, like ‘where’s the olive oil?’ or ‘was there mail today?’ i was three."
7103,where,"‘tomorrow,’ said maman, ‘maybe we’ll find smarties and schnitzel and you can write baba a letter.’ she yawned, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms, where we would sleep every night for sixteen months."
7104,where,the uae was a strange country where middle eastern unrest collided with western decadence.
7105,inside,most mornings we sat inside our grey boxy room to avoid the suffocating heat (you could cook an egg on the sidewalk) and tried to utter the new sounds and syllables maman remembered from university english classes.
7106,escaped,"despite her conservatism and piety, she liked to instigate adventures with us – she had only just turned thirty-two, escaped a bad marriage and she wanted to live."

7108,fugitive,dubai was alluring in its westernness and i still associate certain items with those first fugitive days.

7112,inside,i wrote my name inside my freshly rubbed-out english vocabulary book and got to work.
7113,charge,"every day, he held her hand in his (not the other way around) and pretended he knew just what was going on, that he was in charge of it."

7115,cell,"the memory is unshakeable: being lifted onto the back of a motorcycle by a prison guard in the terrifying olive pasdar uniform, maman  behind me in a long, black chador, the courtyard outside baba’s cell appearing."
7116,charge,"now, we ate at isfahan restaurant free of charge at least once a week, daniel and i running around their shimmery tiled fountain with the younger children as the owner’s wife took orders."
7117,where,"and it made people look at us and, after months as a displaced person, an invisible girl without even a school where i could distinguish myself, i loved being looked at."
7118,court,"that strange dinner in the minor prince’s home is my most vivid memory of dubai, though i learned english and swimming there, tasted corn flakes and bologna for the first time, peeled tar off my legs and saw a man in arab clothing play vigorous tennis with a woman in white shorts, her wild yellow hair brushing her shoulders as she dashed across the court."
7119,where,where was everyone?
7120,illegal,we were now illegal immigrants.
7121,illegal,"they, too, would become illegal, or already had – we didn’t ask."

7125,building,‘they’re turning the building into dorms.
7126,building,"i had never liked living in that building, but i had also never been evicted, or lived in the kind of place that made eviction a possibility."
7127,building,"the owner, with his vast oil sums and his capitalist plans and his rush to repurpose the building before the new academic year, announced that he would move the paid-up tenants to a hotel down the street for the rest of the month."
7128,hole,"i was accustomed to a porcelain hole in the ground with striated foot rests, like a radiator panel, my strong thighs holding me up in squat position as i relieved myself."
7129,toilet,"‘we’ll figure out the toilet in the two weeks we have there,’ said maman."
7130,inside,"we were shown our rooms – thirty years later, i remember the sensation of stepping inside: we were offered two rooms, each with a large bed, connected by a double-door."
7131,building,"he drove for a long time, through unfamiliar streets and a patch of desert and pulled up in front of an unmarked building with a typed sheet on the door."
7132,guilt,"for her, exile was one astounding kindness after another, which she called miracles, forgetting that she was a young mother with a wan, girlish face, in a world run by guilt-eaten men."
7133,authorities,"the authorities had questioned him for weeks after our escape, and after a period of palm greasing and low lying, he convinced them  that he had nothing to do with maman’s new religion, her proselytising, or her escape."
7134,where,over the name and over where we would live and over money (there was never any for us) and over his opium and over her troublesome christianity.
7135,sharia,"maman had been naïve not to guess it: he had married again – his right, under sharia law, as husband to only one woman."
7136,authorities,"and as far as the authorities were concerned, he had renounced his unmanageable first wife to her fate."
7137,court,a court was convened.
7138,jail,you must pay a fine of twenty-thousand dollars and leave the uae in two weeks or you will be put in jail with your children.
7139,case,"the judge paused, looked at his papers, as if considering the case again."
7140,jail,but leave in two weeks or risk jail.’ jahangir made a small noise (who else would have been saddled with the fine but the sponsor?).
7141,court,"‘see that you pay the court fees on your way out,’ he continued."
7142,jail,all three of  you in jail?
7143,court,"whatever the case, thirteen days after the court date, we received a call that italy had said yes."
7144,state,"they weren’t offering us asylum, but they would be our next pass-through state, a safe haven as we petitioned other countries."
7145,authorities,"we needn’t worry about the judge’s deadline, as emirati immigration authorities had been contacted and were satisfied."
7146,inside,"living in a remote village with no car limited our options, but she found an american homeschool that met inside a roman church."
7147,where,"no matter what was served for dinner, maman would put it inside a sandwich (hard, crusty rosetta rolls came with every meal) and hang the sandwiches in plastic bags over the balcony where they might cool and survive the morning bus ride to rome."
7148,sentence,"probably the couple had befriended their compatriot, a student with a guitar and a spasm of curly brown hair, before their sentence at hotel barba began."
7149,awaiting,"day after shapeless day, the three sat in that italian courtyard, smoking and suffering quietly together, awaiting their release from this house of political outcasts."
7150,situation,"maman told me that in hotel barba, no one really knew anybody else’s situation."
7151,escaped,maybe she had escaped political or religious persecution.
7152,camp,they were caught at the border and sent back to the camp with their heads hanging.
7153,where,where would she sleep?
7154,taken,she had taken his card.
7155,imprisonment,"despite the daily burdens of refugee life – unfamiliar  food, hot buses, lack of school, the possibility of being sent back to face imprisonment and death – i believe that everyone there continued to function on that register."
7156,question,"even when first-order needs were in question, love was all for us, the only thing more basic than home or country."
7157,where,"we didn’t know that this would be the last summer of our marriage and the twilight of a decade of travels, but one morning we woke up on holiday in rome and craved to visit the refugee hostel where i had once lived, this place of personal legend – i remember that we both wanted to go."
7158,power,"maybe that’s what drew us back there, the notion that barba had the power to launch me."
7159,building,"the building had been renovated, the courtyard converted to a parking lot and the canteen turned into a restaurant and espresso bar."
7160,where,"when we found the room, i stood on the balcony where we had hung bags of sandwiched dinners."
7161,camp,"my return to camp was unsettling, no return at all."
7162,where,"after my second visit, it also conjures images of me as the unhappy wife of a good man, in a green summer dress, trying to find the tree whose peaches i had stolen, the bench where i taught russian men a few words of english, the sound of a romanian student climbing over my balcony with his guitar."
7163,camp,"people think of the refugee camp as a purgatory, a liminal space without shape or colour."
7164,poverty,"why does patience seem like one of those manipulative, sinister virtues invented to debase and subdue, like chastity or poverty?"
7165,power,"it is the ultimate indignity, to be made to wait; and power is to impose it."
7166,camp,"though in 2011 i was disappointed with my return to mentana, and though barba’s assimilation made me recoil (perhaps making my own suddenly palpable), i left with a promise from the owner that i could return one day, maybe with a translator, to dig for details from  those two years when the hotel served as a refugee camp."
7167,camp,a refugee camp in the hollowed-out carcass of a holiday retreat; a purgatory inside a play-land.
7168,camp,"paul hutchings is co-founder of refugee support, a charity that goes from camp to camp erecting stores with their own currency to distribute donated food and clothing – to give refugees their familiar neighbourhood grocery."
7169,camp,"one day a van would arrive with, say, large jackets and park in one part of the camp."
7170,police,they want to police.
7171,camp,"refugee support began its work in april 2016 at alexandreia camp near thessaloniki, greece."
7172,where,"paul and john set out to open a food store, then a clothing store, a well-designed, peaceful marketplace where a person of note wouldn’t be ashamed to shop."
7173,camp,outside the camp people don’t get baskets.
7174,camp,the camp residents could visit the store monday to friday.
7175,camp,"paul has store designs for katsikas in greece, the newest camp, on his phone."
7176,inside,my choices inside those paper bags seemed a small tragedy.
7177,locked,"it rubs you raw, especially if you were once someone with pride and lofty goals, someone who shook hands and locked eyes."
7178,question,"there was no question of what to wear; i knew that tonight i would offer food to a stranger and that stranger would, for a moment, be humiliated."
7179,ordered,"they dashed off to momofuku instead, ordered pork belly and cocktails and congratulated themselves for leaving (‘it would’ve been overstepping’)."
7180,camp,i know now that barba was a ‘low-hardship camp’.
7181,term,both parts of that term seem dishonest.
7182,camp,"and yes, it was  officially a refugee camp."
7183,camp,and it wasn’t a camp.
7184,camp,because that means that they’ve forgotten they’re in a camp.
7185,taken,"she is an immigrant too, having taken my mother’s sister, the youngest of four children and run away to london before the revolution of 1979, before my birth, when my mother was in her early twenties."
7186,camp,"had she left after the revolution, she might have waited with her countrymen in a camp."
7187,torture,illness and torture.
7188,where,"he told her that she would marry this man, that they would build a new life, that all her scattered children would be brought together again in a great house in london where she would serve the best iranian dishes on antique wedgwood, where well-heeled daughters, thin in elegant dresses, would serve tea, where granddaughters, still married to their first husbands, having not wasted their hard-won ivy league degrees on middling writing careers, would sit at her feet waiting for wisdom, bring her melon and mint in a glass with a long spoon."
7189,camp,"she experiences the waiting no less urgently than those in camp, though hers is invented."
7190,where,"maybe this would be the living room where christopher would sit, where she would bring him a cup of tea, where he would take her hand and say, ‘i’m sorry you waited so long.’ in 2011 when news reached the family that i had moved from my home in amsterdam to some workshop in iowa without philip, and later when we decided to divorce, maman moti stopped speaking to me."
7191,power,"he made money (never mind that my earning power was equal to his, that we had met at princeton, that i had better grades)."
7192,sexism,"then there’s her casual sexism: to my grandmother, an unmarried woman is wasted and so she is in a perpetual in-between space, a time between marriages."
7193,inside,"sometimes she glimpses out at us from inside, but mostly she’s decorating the corridors and rooms inside her mind."
7194,inside,"but she feels them in her body, inside her head."
7195,question,she dismisses the question.
7196,wall,"she leans against a wall, taps her purse, checking for something."
7197,camp,"after you’ve lived in a camp for a few months, the store with fake money and strict friendship rules becomes humiliating too."
7198,camp,we don’t want to contribute to camp becoming permanent for them.
7199,camp,"refugee support has left the camp and my guardian photographer, eirini, is scheduled to meet us at katsikas – our assignment is there and the two camps are hours apart by highway."
7200,authority,minoo’s call will be about housing; she’s been brushed aside by the housing authority for a year.
7201,camp,i dress for the camp in an old shirt and a loose black skirt that hangs down over my muddy boots.
7202,camp,"the gate into the camp opens onto an office, then old, fenced tennis courts."
7203,court,a dog growls at us from inside the court.
7204,court,"the court isn’t surrounded by pavement or stone or grass, just raw ground."
7205,wall,"one wall is window, looking onto the man’s bed, his toiletries and books."
7206,locked,"a greek woman sits in a chair near the door, her eyes locked on her phone."
7207,wall,"on a wall beside an empty shelf, a label says coffee, tea, sugar."
7208,camp,"near an abandoned play area, a pool full of twigs, the commander of the camp joins us."
7209,camp,"there are 219 people in this camp, most from syria, and yet there’s nothing to see but dogs and children and naked gloom."
7210,camp,everyone has a foot in bed and i remember how very little there is to do in a refugee camp.
7211,inside,"now the skin inside my throat loosens, my body’s crude warning sign from my schoolyard days, at first grating, like an unreachable flap of skin, then maddening."
7212,detained,what if i’m detained?
7213,where,where is my elena?
7214,ordered,"i’ve watched people when they’re ordered to do nothing and i know just how life reasserts itself, like that first bubble in still water before the whole pot comes to a boil."
7215,ward,it’s easier to volunteer at a homeless shelter or hospital ward; going back is anathema to instinct.
7216,building,"you are told that the good and the honest will get out somehow, that looking back will turn you into a pillar of salt, that now you must put your energy toward building, belonging, repaying."
7217,camp,no one needs you to return to camp and stir up futile hopes with your presence.
7218,camp,"inside, all sign of camp is gone."
7219,serving,big yellow serving spoons hang on the wall beside a ladle shaped like a sunflower.
7220,camp,"the very air in a camp is heavy, making you listless, pushing you into your bed."
7221,poverty,these childhood days at lm will not be marred by poverty and anticipation for them.
7222,wall,teddy bears are nailed to every wall.
7223,death,and what about death breathing on your cheek .
7224,guilty,that is a guilty puzzle.
7225,state,now i see the state of the cabins before mustafa got his paint roller and hammer.
7226,sink,other pots caked with yesterday’s meals wait beside the sink.
7227,wall,"the cupboards and walls too are chipped; a chunk of wall is gouged out, as if with an ice cream scoop."
7228,where,"shiva’s mother sits on a bench between the kitchen and the stairs, at a small table where the family eats."
7229,stir,they think i’m refusing sugar to be polite and stir a full tablespoon into my tea.
7230,camp,"still, he doesn’t have the experience to run the camp and there have been problems."
7231,camp,and here’s another memory from camp: you become dramatic.
7232,where,i can’t eat an entire meal while it hides under her chador (where she’s stashing it now).
7233,taken,"with the commander happy to stay, they have taken on three extra mouths."
7234,serving,"to distract from the serving, i ask for the recipe."
7235,camp,i’m looking for an excuse to leave because the camp is bearing down on my heart.
7236,serving,"she would serve me yoghurt from her plate, use her own spoon as a serving utensil."
7237,inside,the itch lives inside my mind; i banish it and eat my chicken.
7238,cellular,"the cellular networks are patchy, so instead of music, we talk about our shared obsession with shame – no, not shame, which is entirely contained within."
7239,camp,"‘the way iranians tell stories is so vivid, so slow and detailed, you get dropped into the nightmare.’ when the music blinks on again, we talk about our phones, how everyone in the camp has one."
7240,camp,the number one request when they arrive to any camp?
7241,guard,"farzaneh’s brother was high up in the revolutionary guard – he had a ‘thick neck’, they say in farsi – and he had decided she was an apostate and a brazen, unreligious woman who must be broken."
7242,sink,"as the girls were preparing for bed, washing socks and underwear in the sink and hanging them up to dry overnight, majid stepped outside to make a call."
7243,law,majid found a smuggler and prayed he wouldn’t leave breadcrumbs for his brotherin-law.
7244,guard,"a coast guard ship caught sight of them, shone a light on the boat, blinding the children and ending the journey for that night."
7245,prisons,‘the prisons here are spilling with afghans and iranians.
7246,taken,they were taken to a tiny windowless room in a caravanserai hotel.
7247,guard,the turkish coast guard began yelling into the boat.
7248,ordered,"an officer boarded the dinghy and ordered the refugees to mount the ship by rope ladder, one by one."
7249,guard,"‘that’s not possible,’ said the guard."
7250,guard,"majid stepped in, whispering to his daughter to let go, to go up with the guard and maman would join her."
7251,death,"weeks of wandering in unwashed clothes, daughters wasting away, two failed sea journeys, with death waiting at her doorstep and this man was yelling at a crying child."
7252,freed,"in izmir, they were fingerprinted and freed again."
7253,toilet,now she spoke in secret syllables when hungry or when she needed the toilet.
7254,where,where were they to go to report themselves?
7255,officers,"the officers held them on the water for hours, as the refugees were transported onto rescue boats three or four at a time, their flimsy life jackets exchanged for coast-guard vests and taken to the ship."
7256,camp,"at eight o’clock, they were unloaded in mytilene’s refugee camp, known to its residents as ‘the hell of moria’."
7257,police,‘are you police?’ a young girl asks.
7258,disaster,"farzaneh pours us iranian tea in small glasses and they tell me about escaping from iran; the boat disaster, the mute child, moria."
7259,camp,"he picked it up in moria camp in lesbos, a place he compares to a guatemalan prison."
7260,case,"everyone wants to share theirs, maybe to cut the boredom or in case someone knows someone who might help, or most likely as practice for that day when they will perform it for a jaded and sceptical audience – it is widely understood here that, in becoming an asylum officer, you relinquish all imagination and wonder."
7261,camp,"just before christmas 2017, 450 refugees from ten countries including syria, afghanistan, lebanon, iran and iraq arrived in the empty camp at katsikas, near ioannina."
7262,awaiting,"awaiting them were residential isoboxes, converted steel shipping containers in a gated field, each outfitted with kitchenette and bathroom, beds on metal frames."
7263,camp,"outside a long hallway features art by the camp residents, including a haunting sketch of a laden boat at nighttime, refugees on open water."
7264,where,tables and chairs are set up where families wait their turn.
7265,question,"‘it’s not a question of truth,’ says paul."
7266,camp,"there can be no whiff of case-by-case judgments, the possibility of favouritism, in the camp."
7267,where,"i glance at the corner of the store, where a smile is creasing paul’s temples – he loves it when people complain."
7268,camp,but to be pregnant in a refugee camp – what a curse.
7269,where,"soon i don’t even have to knock any more, or remember who lives where."
7270,war,september 2001 brought a new war to their doorstep.
7271,death,"when men showed up threatening death and dismemberment, he knew he didn’t have much time."
7272,where,"the next day, valid and taraa, along with their three sons and valid’s father and sister, loaded their car and started toward bamyan province, where they often travelled on fridays."
7273,roads,the mountain roads were covered in bright powdery snow.
7274,roads,"famous as one of the world’s most dangerous roads, it had killed many and yet it was often clogged, though no barriers separated the narrow road from the deadly cliffs."
7275,death,they had tampered with the car and now they were navigating death pass with their children on wheels fit only for city streets.
7276,inside,"at a sharp turn inside the mountain, the tyres gave, the car veered, then flipped, turning again and again down a hillside."
7277,death,what fools to think he would crave anything but death now.
7278,where,"he dragged his two living family members to the road, where someone picked them up."
7279,war,"they lived in a war-zone, each night preparing for death and the death of their children."
7280,where,"valid moved his family to iran, where they lived in hiding for years."
7281,where,he only wanted to endure this phase and find a roof in some forgotten corner where he could fry aubergine in turmeric and care for his broken wife.
7282,power,"‘i raised my children with the power of my pen, under the eye of the taliban!’ she said and taraa smiled and said, ‘you are a brave woman, my friend.’  viii."
7283,camp,it’s maddening.’ he tells me that a senior official from amnesty or unhcr visited the camp.
7284,where,"before i leave, majid shows me videos of moria, toilets overrun by sewage where people also bathed, tents on raw ground, children begging to leave."
7285,law,we don’t know asylum law.
7286,camp,"in camp, midnight battles are routine."
7287,roads,"he keeps smuggling himself out of afghanistan, making his way through iran and turkey, sleeping in roads and under bridges, finding menial work until he reaches italy or france."
7288,building,"now, he has a specific destination, not just a better life, but that french town, that building, that small room with pink curtains."
7289,camp,"all over the camp, people look at me the same way, like i am a pinprick portal to america."
7290,police,"he tells me about the outings, the beating by the moral police and his three-month coma."
7291,camp,"now, in camp, he’s found himself more woman trouble."
7292,camp,"despite the ban on work, he sews clothes for his friends at the camp."
7293,injustice,what injustice for these underused boys to see it happen to a woman who is already suffering the waiting place – barthes’s waiting atop the one doled out by a cowardly world; it can kill someone.
7294,gang,to the neighbours it was a gang fight.
7295,where,‘where did you get that?’ i can’t hide my shock and they laugh.
7296,camp,this grandmother doesn’t live in the camp.
7297,camp,"she and her family have greek papers and her son, davood, teaches the camp’s makeshift school without permission or pay."
7298,camp,"this mother and son come to the camp every day, because here are countrymen who need neighbours."
7299,where,i start to ask where the noodles are drying.
7300,wall,"a mattress leans against the wall and thin ropes of dough are drying on the metal bars of the naked bedframe, enough for many families."
7301,camp,"hajira tells me that he is a family friend she met on the phone, that he lives in  france and came to the camp to marry her."
7302,court,"she repeats, ‘on the phone.’ and i say, maybe too girlishly, ‘no, i mean, what did he say to court you?"
7303,inside,"inside, a wheelchair is propped by the door."
7304,camp,"i chat with her husband, valid, about the camp, the store, their journey here."
7305,question,then hajira asks the question i’ve been dreading.
7306,camp,"she’s photographed every camp in greece, even moria."
7307,where,"taraa lifts up her shirt, shows me the long scars up and down her back, the place where her back seems to have been pieced together, badly, from spare parts."
7308,camp,"‘if you don’t want him, drop him off in a camp in england."
7309,detention,"it’s worse there, if you end up in detention.’ ‘they will take unaccompanied minors,’ says hajira."
7310,state,‘the state will raise him.
7311,where,"i glance in the corner, where naser and nushin are sitting on tiny haunches, their backs rigid, huddled diligently over their closed books."
7312,camp,"i spend dusk wandering through the camp, trying to figure out what i’ve done wrong."
7313,camp,"a short walk from the barren lot of the camp (which google maps calls a ‘hospitality centre’) is a boardwalk with chic restaurants, cocktails, good espresso."
7314,camp,the camp or the holding pen.
7315,power,"‘to make someone wait:’ writes barthes, ‘the constant prerogative of all power, “age-old pastime of humanity.”’ i think of my grandmother, frozen in london, the way she recoils from refugees and their tales."
7316,camp,"as evening settles over the camp, washing the walkways between containers in pretty shades of orange, i hear music."
7317,inside,i know almost all the women inside.
7318,wall,she is sitting on a cushion against the wall with her tea glass and she summons me in with her hands.
7319,officers,my life should be all disposable income and sexy clothes and inexplicable connections to asylum officers.
7320,freedom,i want them to think differently of me – that i haven’t squandered my freedom on a joyless life.
7321,camp,he tells me that he has just arrived at the camp.
7322,torture,"these questions torture the mind and yet the world will say, ‘he made it out!"
7323,camp,"from november 2017 until february 2018, refugee support was at tombru camp in bangladesh, a no-man’s land where people live in bamboo and tarpaulin structures, where they suffer severe malnutrition, poor sanitation and lack of medical care."
7324,rape,"many are rape victims and there abound conflict injuries, cholera, diphtheria, overcrowding, sexual violence, to say nothing of the local opposition."
7325,camp,"i had come to this camp expressly to accept cups of tea from their hands, to sit with them and eat a bite as friends."
7326,camp,"i jog back into the camp, find a door, knock."
7327,inside,"i scratch my neck, check inside my backpack and my pockets, for nothing."
7328,war,jim and jean were right-wing evangelical christians – i marvel now that they agreed to sponsor a family of strangers from a place they knew from a hostage crisis and a war.
7329,police,"there is nothing, nothing, like ice cream on an oklahoma summer night, cicadas and twangy music tickling your ear, beside a mouthy grandmother with a bare midriff and no moral police to witness it."
7330,slavery,we drove to the edmond public library where she got us library cards and we checked out thirty books each – stories about rebellious sisters and bodies in puberty and indian ghosts and shameful history like slavery and the trail of tears – that would have been banned at home.
7331,where,i was confused – where did they think i came from?
7332,taken,"my american teacher, though, was accustomed to being taken literally by children, even when the gaps in her words brimmed with meaning."
7333,pleaded,‘but where did you get the cat thing?’ i pleaded with the popular girls.
7334,where,"‘no,’ i said, ‘but i know where that came from.’ again, i had no place to look at recess."
7335,building,"i sat near the jungle gym facing the building, reading, trying to avoid the gaze of children and teachers."
7336,where,"she had set a high standard in iran (‘seventeenth person, not percentile’) and i expected her to quickly start a medical practice, to buy a big house, where we could live, just the three of us, free from the whims of men."
7337,where,"on weekends, maman struggled with the daily nothings of life: where the mail was delivered, how to buy groceries, where to wash our clothes."
7338,where,"maman took solace in the church, where she continued giving her testimony to some group or other every week, shilling the skeleton of our story for a few moments of acceptance."
7339,police,"people loved hearing about the three miracles, about the moral police and maman’s arrests, about the underground church and the brutal hijabi schoolteachers."
7340,serving,"to this day, the detail that baffles me is how much kimchi i ate in my first oklahoma days, the glass bowls of bulgogi, the many intense reds, marinating in our fridge, how we perfected it by serving it on persian rice."
7341,inside,"they advised her to be humbler, to show gratitude to her new country instead of isolating herself inside the iranian community – why did she need him?"
7342,where,"he wouldn’t storm into a schoolyard for me, make a teacher cry and ask her where she went to college."
7343,where,rahim switched us to a discount grocery where sickly onions rolled underfoot.
7344,toilet,i was always sweaty and tired of having the toilet paper monitored.
7345,where,"i flipped to the front, where the top fifty were ranked."
7346,where,"lucky for me, i came from the land of screaming dictées, from a school where there was no place to look but the blood mural or the class rankings, a mother who loved riddles, a father who thought every girl needs a worthy rival – i was itchy and angry and i was only eleven."
7347,police,"kaweh  b  efore the police arrived, kaweh stood in the town square, filthy and hungry and unshaven, and he watched the passersby."
7348,police,the police station was vast and clean.
7349,officers,"when two blond officers greeted them, kaweh whispered, ‘my god, we’re at buckingham palace.’ they were searched and questioned in separate rooms."
7350,illegal,"he had boarded the first lorry carrying nothing, reasoning that documents are useless for illegal border crossings."
7351,cell,"asked if he needed a lawyer, he said, ‘i only want to claim asylum.’ that night he slept in a cell with another refugee."
7352,authorities,i was approached by iranian authorities to be a spy and i refused.
7353,building,"‘i swear,’ said a kurdish man, ‘if they deport me, i’ll kill myself.’ hours later, the van stopped in front of an old building in dover."
7354,term,"the kurdish one said, ‘you will be accommodated here, in temporary lodging, for, at most, twenty-eight days while the home office sorts out longer-term housing and considers your asylum claim.’ the relief was palpable."
7355,camp,"in this camp kaweh decided to lie, for fear of iranian intelligence still pursuing him."
7356,taken,"he thought, better not to be taken seriously by this reporter, better to be thought an opportunist."
7357,sink,"each night, he washed his clothes in the sink and hung them up to dry, since he couldn’t go to the laundromat naked."
7358,law,"kaweh hired a young solicitor, a trainee in immigration law, who told him he would be removed to turkey, since he first claimed asylum there."
7359,case,"‘it’s better if you don’t take my case.’ when kaweh returned to his room, he learned that his roommate’s brother had arranged a london solicitor for him."
7360,case,"kaweh asked for the solicitor’s phone number; maybe he would take kaweh’s case, too."
7361,where,"he borrowed money and took a bus to london, where the solicitor’s interpreter met him at victoria coach station and took him to his own home for the night."
7362,case,"‘your case is complex and this solicitor is busy,’ he said."
7363,awaiting,"for fifty days, he lived in the temporary hostel, awaiting word from the home office."
7364,where,where did you grow up?
7365,question,"‘if saddam hussein is such a nice person,’ she said, ‘why did the united states attack him?’ kaweh broke in, speaking english now, ‘and the uk.’ years later, he would think back on this day and regret his arrogant iranian style: answering a question with another to highlight its absurdity."
7366,torture,"a wiser, older man would have reminded the officer that saddam was a brutal dictator, that kaweh wasn’t an iraqi national and might have been branded a spy, that many iranians died under saddam’s torture."
7367,authorities,"‘you said before that the iranian authorities promised to send you to sweden if you spied for them,’ she said, ‘and now you said canada."
7368,officers,"are you lying to us?’ in fact, the iranian intelligence officers had contacted him many times, each time with new promises."
7369,sentence,"and when ross asked for the definition, she said, ‘i don’t know all the words!’ when ross asked her to use it in a sentence, rachel said, ‘emma just said “gleba!”’ then she stomped off to look it up in a dictionary and ross shouted after her, ‘while you’re at it, why not look up ppttthhhhhhh.’ it had been a while since kaweh couldn’t stop laughing."
7370,death,now and then he heard of a death or a return home.
7371,pleading,"not everyone survives – you can tell yourself, i’m never eating out, never buying a bag of chips or a bus ticket, but you can’t deny your pleading child."
7372,inside,"many such men and women had died, lost inside brutal regimes or to despair."
7373,camp,"a man named hadi had a home in almere, near a camp, and sometimes iranians gathered there for dinners or tea."
7374,illegal,a dozen or so legal and illegal iranians from nearby ate chickpea cookies and broken pieces of sesame candy; they dipped sugar cubes into their tea and sat against cushions and talked of home.
7375,building,"‘i speak turkish and arabic, a little english, too.’ hadi said that he could easily find building work for him if he was any good as an electrician."
7376,where,‘where are you living?’ asked hadi.
7377,camp,"‘at the camp,’ he said."
7378,lawyer,"his sister was a lawyer, the child who had fulfilled their mother’s hopes."
7379,lawyer,she could still learn perfect dutch and english and be a western lawyer – imagine that.
7380,case,‘what case are you giving?’ someone asked.
7381,case,"it was a man named parvis, an aspiring restaurateur whose own case would soon be settled."
7382,question,"kambiz considered the question, as he had done for days – there was the woman he had befriended, her angry husband, the menace always at his door."
7383,authority,surely having a sepâh come to your door and threaten your life is enough for the netherlands’ immigration authority (the ind)?
7384,police,"he told his asylum interviewers about his journalist friends, his woman friend, the moral police who came to his door."
7385,illegal,"the ind dismissed his story once, then again, and his status fell from asylum seeker to ‘illegal’."
7386,camp,"the ind informed him that, with his case now closed, he was no longer welcome at the camp."
7387,police,"i have to get my answer and start my life.’ he planned to present himself again at ter apel or to the police, this time with more details about his affairs in iran."
7388,court,"they pretend the islamic republic is clean and by-the-book, like the court in the hague."
7389,taken,he had taken to self-pity and long bouts of complaining.
7390,case,but you must say something new for the case to be reopened.
7391,case,he listened for a long time as his friend took pouri through his case.
7392,police,"soon after, he presented himself to the police, explaining that his case was closed but he wished to tell his story again."
7393,cell,he was thrown into a cell.
7394,detention,kambiz spent nearly a year in detention.
7395,death,he became depressed and began to dream of death.
7396,where,why should he go quietly and unseen back to a country where he would wither and die anyway?
7397,imprisonment,"in late 2010, some months into his imprisonment, word reached refugee aid about kambiz, that he was alone, without family or proper legal aid, and that he had been held in the schiphol detention centre for a long time."
7398,inside,"fearing he might be lost inside the system, they asked frank van haren, an asylum lawyer, to visit him."
7399,detention,"the detention centre is a huge, boxy building near schiphol airport."
7400,guard,"after security, a guard brought him to a room with a phone."
7401,case,"‘i want to re-open my case,’ said kambiz."
7402,officers,"‘i’m happy to do that,’ said van haren, ‘but you need something new to present to the immigration officers."
7403,case,"if you can prove your case, we can possibly win.’ ‘do you really believe that?’ said kambiz."
7404,lawyer,van haren wasn’t his first asylum lawyer.
7405,detention,"he had been released from detention (having refused to obtain an iranian passport) and had dug around, calling old friends and acquaintances, until he had found new facts and documents linking him to various journalistic circles in iran."
7406,where,but we’re back where we started.
7407,case,"i can’t take your case.’ kambiz decided to appeal to ter apel one more time, to start proceedings on his own behalf."
7408,lawyer,the legal aid lawyer on duty sat with him.
7409,case,she explained that his case had no chance.
7410,detention,"‘if i get another negative,’ he said to whomever would listen, ‘i think i’d like to die.’ in the long, grey days following detention, he stayed up with parvis late into the nights, letting his tea go cold."
7411,lawyer,"‘come now, let’s go talk to a new lawyer."
7412,case,"‘you don’t need a christian case.’ ‘i can’t say that,’ he said."
7413,question,he didn’t wait long enough for anyone to notice or question him.
7414,death,the manner of the death made him uneasy.
7415,where,‘where’s kambiz?’ he said.
7416,police,"what if he did it?’ parvis took his children home and went straight to the police, who were in the process of identifying the victim."
7417,police,but we will call you.’ the police took parvis’s name and address.
7418,death,it’s a death only a refugee would want.
7419,police,that night he got a call – the police wanted him to come to the hospital to identify the body.
7420,inside,he was burned from so far inside; nothing worked any more.
7421,police,"the next day, the police called again."
7422,taken,kambiz would be taken off life support.
7423,law,"when the bag arrived, kambiz’s brother-in-law phoned."
7424,illegal,"‘he was illegal, living in a rented room.’ it was painful to say to this family that their son’s life had amounted to nothing."
7425,death,"the day after kambiz’s death, parvis spoke to the radio station."
7426,lawyer,"he was a refugee.’ and despite the media’s many mistakes in reporting kambiz’s story (calling van haren his lawyer, claiming he met parvis in an asylum centre, that he was homeless on the streets), from then on, at least, they called him a refugee."
7427,death,"the ind never did even that: immigration and asylum minister gerd leers called mr roustayi’s death ‘very tragic’, but says all the procedures were followed correctly and that the man was given proper legal assistance."
7428,question,"he asked the mayor, ‘do you question your system at all?’ the mayor replied, ‘what could be done?"
7429,where,"kambiz broke because he needed purpose and family and progress.’ some mornings, frank van haren looked out his window at the spot in dam square where kambiz had set himself alight."
7430,freedom,"319 still registers as rescue, literary outings, cheap wine on a tuesday night, real friends, freedom)."
7431,freedom,freedom!
7432,death,"i watched the video of kambiz’s death almost every day, until i knew its morbid choreography."
7433,power,"how is the ind to tell them apart?’ i thought of how i would soon board a plane to iowa city – my own opportunistic escape, the one in which i finally have agency and power and ambitions."
7434,escaped,"in a few months, i would become a wanderer again, but definitely not the same kind as i had been when we  escaped."
7435,arrest,where were her arrest papers?
7436,executed,how could this be if she was about to be executed?
7437,evin,"why wasn’t she sent to evin, the larger, more terrifying prison in tehran?"
7438,freedom,surely no dentist inspires such loyalty that a patient would risk his job and freedom to smuggle his fugitive family?
7439,officers,"i felt like i was dropped in front of a tribunal of asylum officers, unhappy white men openly hating me for coming in and taking too much, wanting too much, their birthrights."
7440,guilty,"as if, in iran, only the guilty are hanged."
7441,death,as if every credible threat of death is recorded in triplicate at the ministry of intelligence.
7442,question,my life happened – how dare they question that.
7443,question,"what great temptation to roll up the ladder behind you and move on, to question every story according to the narrowest standards, trying to match its peculiar details to your own."
7444,guilty,to offer a ‘true’ story is a guilty business.
7445,lawyer,"‘iranians exaggerate, that is the main problem in preparing them for questioning,’ says a stellar iranian asylum lawyer i met in london."
7446,poverty,"‘yes, they deserve rescue, but they should tell the truth!’ she is also not an economic  migrant, or else a terrible one, since she moved from the respect and comfort of a doctor’s life to poverty and factory work."
7447,injustice,"after twisting into knots to reject every radical desire of her heart – to be seen, to be held equal to men – she couldn’t become a feminist, but she could rebel against most extreme injustice while making her mother happy; she could claim liberation while remaining a good girl who serves male ambition."
7448,question,it is often a question of whether the storyteller herself believes.
7449,question,i take the question to that stellar asylum lawyer in london.
7450,lawyer,"he is kaweh beheshtizadeh, former runaway, teacher and archivist for the kurdish democratic party of iran, who arrived outside of birmingham in the back of a lorry and is now one of the most accomplished young asylum lawyers in london, winning legal aid lawyer of the year in 2017."
7451,lawyer,"‘those who lie do so for three reasons.’ when he can, kaweh numbers his answers – there are three issues here, or, let’s establish four points of context – i can’t imagine a time he wasn’t a lawyer."
7452,taken,"second, success stories taken out of context."
7453,question,"‘when did you become a christian?’ his expression doesn’t change, except for a small squint in his eye and i almost don’t register that he’s repeating his question."
7454,stretch,"if you ask me, the biggest stretch of the imagination is that underpaid bureaucrats have such profound insight into the human heart."
7455,death,"that it happened doesn’t make it true enough for fiction and, like the asylum seeker who isn’t believed, novels that are seen to lie are doomed to death."
7456,power,"at the same time, it stays close to the raw story that only a single person can know and contains all the power of that lived reality."
7457,where,"they don’t start in the middle of the action (as western writers are taught to do) or even at the beginning (where western logic may take them), they start long before the beginning: ‘let me tell you about modern iran,’ they say, because that is how they are trained to begin."
7458,guard,"at once logical and judgmental of demeanour, both are on guard for manipulation and emotional trickery."
7459,fugitive,"it’s not so hard, you penniless, traumatised fugitive from a ravaged village, just write a story worthy of the new yorker."
7460,power,she gets to decide what it looks like and she has settled on a hagiographic story of faith and the power of jesus christ.
7461,lawyer,dutch asylum lawyer marq wijngaarden tells me of a chinese woman from a persecuted sect.
7462,case,"wijngaarden had the case reviewed and won, but the first rejection was unnerving: they need to be better at hearing people."
7463,fugitive,"so, you see, poor, traumatised fugitive from a ravaged village, even if you do choose the right wedge, even if you do gather up the sensory details, avoid melodrama and write that story worthy of the new yorker, nothing’s guaranteed – even the greatest writer can’t reach a lazy, cynical reader."
7464,camp,"i take a train to almere, a depressing suburb close to a refugee camp."
7465,where,i poke around the business park where parvis has a persian restaurant.
7466,lawyer,he isn’t a lawyer.
7467,detention,"he tells me about families and lone wanderers he’s worked with, about the many suicides, about his efforts to make iranians understand dutch logic, about the injustices of the detention centres, about hegel and other philosophers."
7468,lawyer,an asylum lawyer stood up at a recent conference and spoke about a conversation he overhead in the ind lunchroom at ter apel: one asylum officer bragging to another: “today i had a real and true political dissident.
7469,case,"but no one gives a communist case because the dutch don’t acknowledge the gruesome things the iranian government does to communists – they hang them for drugs or kill them in secret and the dutch say, “they don’t persecute communists.” if your life is in danger, the dutch force  you into a gay or christian case."
7470,tortured,"if she had said, “they took me away and raped and tortured me”, that’s individual; but a public pillage isn’t about you."
7471,rape,"you’re not a dissident, just an ordinary rape victim."
7472,where,"but, tell me, dina, do you know any western country where soldiers do this?"
7473,case,"surely, there is a case in that?"
7474,rape,"i used to joke that if a rapist comes, it’s best to ask, “please, sir, take me into a room alone for the rape."
7475,rape,but group rape won’t help you.
7476,criminal,"you see, the criminal has to acknowledge your humanity for the ind to respect it."
7477,criminal,"if the criminal treats you like a cow in a stable, the ind will too."
7478,case,"‘i had a former communist come to me, an honest man, no case-bazi."
7479,jail,he had spent ten years in iranian jail.
7480,tortured,he was tortured in the horrifying ways of the 1980s.
7481,torture,his body is a torture museum.
7482,authorities,every month he checked in with the authorities and got a stamp.
7483,jail,ten years in iranian jail and five years in dutch camp.
7484,war,"briefly, i stop worrying about my phone bill and consider mr pouri’s mental space – it is clogged with this one global injustice – that people from the poor and war-ravaged countries of the world are routinely labelled liars and opportunists."
7485,death,"‘there is no such a thing as bad faith in life-or-death situations,’ he said."
7486,prisons,"‘courts have accepted that prisons in iran are so bad, just being there for a few days will breach your human rights."
7487,detention,"there’s the prospect of detention, torture, rape."
7488,case,"bad faith is irrelevant in this case.’ funny, the things they let go."
7489,where,"‘this is an area where people have the wrong instincts,’ says mr pouri."
7490,guilt,"it’s better to claim guilt.’ the more dumb and reckless you were at home, the better."
7491,officers,he is adamant that the law forbids officers from asking for any sexual facts and certainly they can’t ask for any to be performed.
7492,court,they must reject any photos or videos freely offered – this is the ruling of the european court of justice.
7493,officers,"they say they’re evolving, but the officers still ask humiliating questions."
7494,officers,"you are out.’ the law may have adapted, but the nuances of coming out haven’t sunk in for the individual asylum officers."
7495,case,"it’s easier to hang a case on big, showy gestures and concrete dangers than good faith or motivation."
7496,officers,"i remember shrouk el-attar, a twenty-five-year-old queer egyptian engineering student who, during a petition to the uk parliament in march 2018, spoke of the humiliation of having to describe her sexual encounters in graphic detail to asylum officers."
7497,sentence,mr pouri stops mid-sentence to take a call.
7498,illegal,‘he’s illegal.
7499,camp,"he lives illegally at the camp, sneaking in and bunking with friends."
7500,war,"i told them, islam is war."
7501,rape,"the dutch want more complexity.’ this is a problem, not just for the uneducated, but for trauma victims who have gaps in memory and rape victims who are ashamed."
7502,officers,"we know the missing part of houshiar’s story, the wedge, the thing he is keeping from us and from the asylum officers and perhaps the reason he is rejected."
7503,question,"but we can’t just blurt out this question; we need to say it without violating iranian social rules, to cloak it in a second meaning."
7504,case,"‘your case is important,’ says the husband."
7505,case,"we say, ‘gay is a better case,’ or, ‘it’s useful to be gay,’ when what we mean is, ‘it’s ok. you are allowed to be you.’ we want to tell houshiar that iran is long behind him and he can have an open life here, in this hamlet of scattered countrymen."
7506,stir,she has been watching the simmer and wants to stir the pot.
7507,suspect,"houshiar, it seems, has no idea we suspect him."
7508,case,so many young people out of iran give a gay case.
7509,case,"‘whatever your case,’ says the husband, ‘you must throw yourself in it, drown in it."
7510,hanged,"whether he applies with the christian story or the gay story, the essential truth is this: his life in iran would be entirely in the shadows, until the day he crosses paths with the wrong person and then he might be hanged."
7511,case,"what we assign as our story, our compelling case, will shape all our future days."
7512,death,"the whole of the arc, from birth to death, leads to and grows out from the wedge, that cluster of days when life was forever altered."
7513,case,"iranians may act on miracles and visits from jinns and prophetic dreams, but as in the case of the novice writer, ‘it happened’ isn’t enough."
7514,war,"a fact, given disproportionate context and attention, can lie about a life, or a day, or a marriage, a war, a childhood."
7515,detention,"if houshiar manages to evade detention long enough, perhaps he could try again in some years."
7516,court,but a recent court decision in luxembourg established that coming out can take years.
7517,where,the heavy sensation of those days returns and i don’t know where to put it.
7518,case,in case you’re feeling nostalgic for your old life.
7519,lawyer,"i make my way toward dam square – maybe there is a memorial – and toward the offices of frank van haren, the asylum lawyer quoted in the stories about kambiz."
7520,death,"at dinner last night, pooyan’s wife showed me her drawing of kambiz and her diary from the days after his death."
7521,where,"as i approach the place where kambiz set himself alight, i hear farsi."
7522,death,they speak about death but don’t mention kambiz.
7523,death,"they talk about the sensation of death, the pain of passing."
7524,jailed,"he was a communist and, in the 1980s, the islamic republic killed or jailed all of his  friends."
7525,lawyer,he works one day a week for a lawyer and earns enough.
7526,lawyer,"‘not a lawyer, but close to a lawyer."
7527,locked,one young woman became homeless and was taken in by a stranger who kept her locked in a room for three years.
7528,detention,"she never spoke up, for fear of being tossed into detention."
7529,escaped,"she escaped and found mr pouri, but was too ashamed to go public."
7530,deportation,but they keep those things from refugees until they help with their own deportation.
7531,detention,"from there, you could end up in detention for eighteen months at a time.’ he tells me about a client who lived for twenty-six years in the netherlands, eleven of those in detention."
7532,detention,"they kept catching him for minor infractions (sleeping in stations, squatting) and putting him into detention, sometimes for the maximum time, sometimes less."
7533,jail,‘who would spend eleven years in jail if they could go back?
7534,jail,"at some point, is it so hard to believe that home isn’t an option?’ even by strict dutch logic, he has proved his case by his choices, because that eleventh year in dutch jail is not preferable to requesting a passport home."
7535,detention,people kill themselves in detention and in the camps.
7536,detention,"in detention, they look in every hole in your body."
7537,rape,it’s crushing humiliation and it retraumatises all the rape victims.
7538,rape,"there’s a rape victim screaming and four guards pour onto her, their hands everywhere."
7539,law,because they want to humiliate; the law is designed to crush people from eastern cultures.’ he takes a breath.
7540,jail,"‘imagine a life spent between the streets, the camps and jail, not because you’re a criminal or have no skills, but just because no country wants you!’ in all these years, i’ve never met a more passionate advocate for the displaced."
7541,police,"everyone, he says, from lawyers to refugees to activists, police, professors, allies (later frank van haren, forough and pooyan confirm this)."
7542,police,"a man stands on a wall and the police say, ‘don’t you care about your girlfriend?"
7543,authorities,another is on a bridge; he has asked the authorities to phone pouri.
7544,jail,"if you come down for nothing, you’ll be in jail for wasting everyone’s time.’  hunger strikers are a special case, because the authorities don’t like to have their arms twisted."
7545,death,"but by the fourth week, you feel death coming."
7546,jail,a man called me from jail.
7547,detention,my stomach hurts so much.” in detention they put food in front of you every day.
7548,power,officers can become power-mad and vindictive.
7549,case,"a woman and her lawyer, one of the idealists who work extra hours for nothing, have prepared a perfect case: her infant son is dutch through his father."
7550,law,the law says he is entitled to his mother.
7551,case,her case is routine.
7552,where,"the officer asks at the start, as an aside, ‘where is your old expired passport?"
7553,where,she doesn’t know where that old thing is stashed.
7554,lawyer,"her lawyer says, ‘what does it have to do with you?"
7555,case,"as in houshiar’s case, lgbtq iranians take a long time to believe that gayness isn’t shameful."
7556,rape,the same is true for rape victims.
7557,jail,once mr pouri was called to speak to a man who had refused to tell ind that he was raped in iranian jail.
7558,torture,you survived all that torture.
7559,torture,rape is just a torture.
7560,torture,many of my friends have survived torture.’ the man wouldn’t be comforted and so mr pouri brought in an old communist friend who was tortured after the iranian revolution.
7561,war,he spoke in the language of brothers at war.
7562,case,"‘when you finally bring the ind the truth in the second case, after you’ve worked through the trauma and self-hate, the dutch say, “you went off and learned the system."
7563,case,"the case took years, with several rejections."
7564,question,"in the new century, this simple, foundational belief is in question among the world’s freest, most comfortable populations."
7565,court,"the civilised world is kind; it has the geneva convention, a court of human rights."
7566,where,where do you wash them?
7567,basij,‘a powerful basij vows to kill me.’ it sounds like a personal matter.
7568,situation,"it is all a question of motive: whatever your technique, do you wish for the listener to come closer or further from understanding a place, a situation?"
7569,disaster,it is the language of disaster often used to describe incoming refugees – deluge or flood or swarm.
7570,war,"in many cases, the pursuit of that bounty is the very thing that has impoverished and war-ravaged the east."
7571,question,"this question never fails to plunge me in icy shame, transporting me to my high-school remaking, the admissions committees who, thinking they had found passion and talent, fell for the symptoms of my disproportion."
7572,gate,he offers to walk me to the gate.
7573,gate,"at the gate, he says goodbye, pats me on the back."
7574,guard,a guard stares at us.
7575,state,"and, further improving my odds, championships at the local, state and national levels were handed out by gender, belt, age and weight categories."
7576,where,"each time i performed drills on the kicking bag, pivoting on the thick carpet until the balls of my feet bled, i thought: i am a refugee girl with brains and muscles and i’ve landed in a country where every road is open to me."
7577,state,"please eat something.’ i won many trophies and medals, including a state title in both forms and sparring – every medal was stamped with two men fighting, just like the wrestling medal i had found in the empty closet."
7578,state,girls like that would get into oklahoma state and they’d throw parties to celebrate.
7579,court,"she’d take a science class or two where the teacher would keep calling on chad or brad, she’d stamp out her frustrations on the tennis court and die the wife of some middle manager – america, i was learning, was no feminist paradise."
7580,where,"it was a bittersweet day, the stadium filled with cheering locals, a line of men, women and children winding around and around the field toward a microphone at the end zone, where each of us would be named and sworn in."
7581,where,where had they been hiding?
7582,where,"halfway through the ceremony, an elderly indian man was led to the microphone, where he introduced himself and swore allegiance to the united states."
7583,police,i closed my eyes and conjured up the moral police and our leering associate pastor and the oklahoma parishioners who talked casually of protecting their daughters from the corruption of college.
7584,inside,i lay there for a while watching the inside of my eyelids change from reds to blues.
7585,taken,"because here was something i knew: when a life is obliterated, all its joys taken away, what makes memories stick is repetition."
7586,taken,wasn’t i lucky to have been taken along in my mother’s escape?
7587,where,"hers, a strict iranian upbringing in the home of modern but austere tehrani intellectuals; mine, those unstable refugee years in dubai and rome followed by asylum in the united states, where i was a lesser citizen among americans who had seen nothing of the world."
7588,murdering,"iran was a shameful, confused part of my past, a jumble of contradictions i could solve only by murdering the wild village girl and becoming the best kind of american: elegant and iron-hard, a woman without need."
7589,war,"if my life was gruelling, it was a kind of gruelling that hadn’t been imposed by politics or war; it was fair and rational and would bear fruit."
7590,poverty,"and, so, i was invincible to everything but patterns: unending poverty, intellectual hunger, body fat, drudgery."
7591,lawyer,"tell me what you want to do then.’ ‘i’m going to be an international corporate lawyer,’ i said."
7592,war,we mellowed in our iranian-ness and the end of the gulf war renewed the feelings of gratitude and american exceptionalism already in the air.
7593,transferred,"i had no loyalty to harvard; and in fact, my loyalty was transferred instantly and for ever by the simple fact that a great institution had said: we want you."
7594,chain,"‘a terrible restaurant chain,’ she says."
7595,lawyer,"i tell my student about kaweh, the asylum lawyer, and about living off thirty-five dollars a week."

7602,abuse,"i feel the urge to abuse sam, but he’s doing the dishes alone and i’m not that much of a hobgoblin yet."
7603,gang,‘student council’ isn’t the name of his gang.

7613,freedom,"in his confessions, saint augustine asks god for freedom from physical desire, but not yet."
7614,wall,"so maybe my conversion happened much earlier, that first morning on the blacktop when i decided to look away from khomeini’s beard and look for my own name on a list on the wall."
7615,locked,"but a new perception, a sudden emotional shock, or an occasion which lays bare the organic alteration, will make the whole fabric fall together; and then the centre of gravity sinks into an attitude more stable, for the new ideas that reach the centre in the rearrangement seem now to be locked there and the new structure remains permanent.’ this description of religious conversion sounds an awful lot like the core of the web being blasted away."
7616,officers,"again, i don’t think that happens in a day; though (and this is vital for immigration officers to understand) awareness, commitment and euphoria might."
7617,question,"that the psyche enables conversion, that the soul prepares for redemption, over years, this makes me question the notion that conversion remakes the soul into some ‘new structure’."
7618,ordered,the way he took us to a japanese grill and ordered a bottle of sake for himself.
7619,where,"and yet, maybe, that is where cultural change begins."

7625,building,"‘you’ll tell each other that story,’ i say, ‘when you have a big house and he’s a doctor and famous footballer.’ ‘yes!’ she says, ‘god willing.’ the next day, the man from the council visits minoo at the hostel building and compels her, without me or daniel present, to add a ground-floor restriction to her housing request."
7626,liberty,"o  n 8 march 2018, international women’s day, i walked into parliament with several hundred women from forty organisations, mostly undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers from sub-saharan africa, to lobby for safety, dignity and liberty."
7627,detention,"‘shut down yarl’s wood!’ we cried, protesting the infamous detention centre where many are held for weeks or months with no purpose."
7628,inmates,"eventually, most yarl’s wood inmates are released back into english society, though not exactly, because when you are barred from work you become a part of a separate underground society."

7636,case,shola is preparing her students to speak out with their stories and to make a case for themselves to lawmakers.

7638,crimes,"without the liberty to work, the confidence to report violence and exploitation without fear of one’s own smaller crimes, a dark economy springs up."
7639,illegal,"once branded ‘illegal’, most women find their way into these kinds of work, sometimes for cash, sometimes for food and a place to sleep."
7640,charge,"people offer her a place to sleep on the floor, often on a mattress that she has to procure herself from charity organisations, in exchange for taking full-time care of the children free of charge."
7641,authorities,"if the authorities come, she has to identify herself as the child’s official caregiver, so that the parents don’t get in trouble."
7642,detained,"this, of course, poses a problem for her because she can be arrested, detained and deported – she is working for room and board, a clear violation of the rules."
7643,power,"you must leave.’ when you have no rights, everyone has power over you."
7644,torture,from the torture of detainment after having been beaten and raped in our home countries.

7647,state,"turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves jesus and judas equally aside.’ astonishing – all that matters to emerson is the state of transition, the toiling, the wanting, all the parts of myself i found ugliest."

7649,where,"i travel to berlin, where a friend introduces me to a group of refugees from syria and afghanistan."

7654,where,"i lay awake for many dark nights, thinking of where i had gone wrong."
7655,guilty,"i spent my marriage feeling guilty: i wanted too much, i made everything political, i didn’t appreciate the life philip provided for us; i didn’t have babies."

7660,offenders,"they sort of cringed.’ i had assumed it was acceptable to joke about javads, as it is hipsters, because it crosses economic class (the worst offenders are rich)."

7666,racism,they are prone to embracing the very racism and classism that most harms them.
7667,law,"it’s much like marrying into a family and gritting your teeth at their customs, the way your new father-in-law sits at the head of the table, waiting to be served, or the way your new aunt swipes a careless finger across a dirty plate."
7668,offence,"it is knowing not only the meaning of words, but how to use them, how to ask questions, how to make a joke, what gives offence."
7669,sexism,was this old-world sexism from home?
7670,power,"she is offering her power, the wealth of our scattered family and the source of its division, letter by letter, story by story, to an unimpressed white man who doesn’t want her."
7671,question,"insiders never question their most basic impulses; they just are, an inevitable ingredient in the air others breathe."

7681,police,brown men don’t taunt the police.
7682,taken,i’ve always taken it.
7683,wall,"in our early days in america, he didn’t blame me – there was a crack in the wall that kept us both out of the nicer rooms; i had found a way to peek in, but i was still just an iranian kid with slightly lighter skin than her brother, still a kid who was mocked and excluded and made to feel like nothing."
7684,where,"sometimes in cafés, if i heard someone mention oklahoma i would say, ‘oh i’m from there!’ and i’d have an entire conversation without anyone saying, ‘where are you really from, though?’ or, ‘where did you live before that?’ (mexico, they assumed)."
7685,taken,"it has taken decades to see that western society, this institution to which i aspired, is badly broken and that i benefit from its faults in ways that i didn’t as a child and that my brother still doesn’t."

7693,camp,"shouldn’t she have the same opportunities as you?’ now i think to katsikas, quiet naser, whose mother asked me to take him, to drop him off at a camp."
7694,freedom,england won’t be all freedom and parties and hijab-burning.
7695,camp,they’ll tell her that she’s lying and she’s actually twenty and she’ll end up on the streets or raped in a camp.
7696,situation,"baba joon, she’s not some poor villager born into an unlucky situation."
7697,torture,"it isn’t only that i want her to work hard, or that i want to save her the torture of living as an undocumented migrant."
7698,tortured,"that she wants to hop down from a safe perch and breeze on into england, right past the tortured dissidents and the starving babies, past the mothers clutching their children in boats, past farzaneh and majid, past taraa and vaild and naser, who still haunts me, past darius, whose feet will probably never touch british or american soil, this is what angers me."
7699,freedom,they don’t savour freedom; they crave their families.
7700,lawyer,"for a moment, as i speak to baba, i fantasise about forcing my indulged little sister to endure what kaweh did, the long days in the library, the non-stop english radio, all that rigour – i will sit beside her and i will force the learning into her mind and i will make her a doctor or a lawyer."
7701,illegal,"i don’t want my half-sister to think that she’s coming to paradise and end up doing nothing but illegal childcare, vulnerable to every human wickedness."
7702,power,i want to believe in my own agency and power.
7703,stretch,"so many doors have opened to us, it’s impossible to accept that there is no obligation, that we’ve arrived in a place we can relax and stretch out, that all the honest work to prove our worth, to assuage the helplessness, to rub out our previous identities, was for nothing."
7704,racism,"it happened to me when i saw my mother struggle in oklahoma, when she complained of racism and bias and lack of respect or true welcome."
7705,where,"i may have returned to iran, or to any one of the other places where i’ve tried to make a home."
7706,inside,"for now, somehow, without thinking, a village has sprung up inside my little flat."

7708,torture,"to steve crawshaw of human rights watch and freedom from torture, melissa fleming of unhcr, eduard nazarski and annemarie busser of amnesty international netherlands, and anneke van woudenberg of raid, and to asylum lawyers kaweh beheshtizadeh, marq wijngaarden, frank van haren, and human rights lawyer, daniel leader: thank you for smoothing so many paths."
7709,freedom,| political science / political freedom & security / general.
7710,murder,"every other nation on earth had stopped routinely executing minors, but iran regularly imposed the death penalty on children for a range of crimes, from murder to manslaughter in self-defense."
7711,sentenced,"in 2004, the authorities sentenced a sixteen-year-old girl to death for premarital sex, or “crimes against chastity.” the judge himself reputedly acted as executioner, leading the schoolgirl to the noose, blindfolding her, and motioning for the crane to hoist her from the ground."
7712,state,"the state didn’t want any attention brought to these executions, especially internationally, but my colleagues and i had worked hard to show a pattern of such sentencing."
7713,where,"it was perhaps the boldest report we had ever produced, and we were due to share it with the united nations, where we knew the islamic republic would face condemnation."
7714,building,"pulling away from the curb, i noticed a mural on the side of a building, shining under a streetlamp, baiting america and the west: “sanction us; we’ll cope.”  the roads were silent except for the rain under my tires."
7715,inside,"i thought about the report waiting inside, on my desk, and its horrible depictions of children hanging from cranes."
7716,killing,killing you is the easiest thing we could do.
7717,war,"i remember when so many of my friends and relatives began leaving the country in the 1980s, disheartened by the bombs raining down from the war with iraq and by the morality police checkpoints set up by the still new islamic government."
7718,where,did one leave the city where one’s children had been born?
7719,court,"when i walked into the country’s highest court and the new revolutionary authorities told me that women could no longer be judges, i stayed."
7720,court,i stayed when the authorities demoted me to clerk in the same court i had presided over as a judge.
7721,justice,"i shut my ears when the revolutionaries who had taken over the justice system talked in my presence about how women were fickle and indecisive and unfit to mete out justice, which would now be the work of men."
7722,executed,"i stayed when the new authorities said islam demanded violent justice, that islam allowed for young men and women to be executed on rooftops and hung from cranes for their political beliefs, their bodies dumped in mass graves."
7723,execution,"if we bowed our heads and stayed quietly at home, permitting them to say that islam allowed the assassination of writers and the execution of teenagers, what would be left of our faith?"
7724,war,"in the early 1990s, after the war had ended, the girls were older and didn’t need me as much."
7725,law,"i briefly tried practicing family law, but i saw quickly that the courts under the islamic republic operated very differently than they had under the shah."
7726,authorities,"the authorities permitted women to work as lawyers, but the system and all its new procedures were so dysfunctional that it was impossible to take a case forward."
7727,courthouse,"on several occasions, i had trouble simply trying to review a file at the courthouse."
7728,justice,"there, the person who was willing to pay more was in the right; justice was bought, not fought for or deliberated."
7729,law,"to protest, i eventually hung a big sign in front of my law office: “due to the current inhospitable circumstance of the courts, i will no longer be accepting clients and can only offer legal advice.” this did not feel, at the time, like a particularly risky thing to do."
7730,state,"i was simply being honest about the country’s legal climate, rather than consciously trying to defy the state."
7731,crimes,"after a while, people who could not afford to hire a lawyer—often defendants who had been accused of political crimes—found their way to me."
7732,criminal,the state of criminal law was especially grave after the 1979 revolution.
7733,criminal,"the islamic republic had replaced the secular criminal code iran had followed under the shah with a system of islamic law based on seventh-century readings of sharia, islamic law."
7734,case,i still vividly remember the case that revealed to me the full extent of the system’s dysfunction and cruelty.
7735,death,"the men raped her, struck her repeatedly on the head, and then threw her to her death over a nearby cliff."
7736,arrested,the local police arrested the men.
7737,court,"one mysteriously hung himself in prison, and the court found the other two guilty of rape and murder."
7738,convicted,"because the laws at the time valued the life of a man convicted of murder more than that of a girl raped and tossed off a cliff, leila’s family was held responsible for paying for their executions."
7739,sharia,"the islamic republic claimed that these laws were based on the principles of blood money in islamic sharia, but i believed that not only were they unjust, they were a distortion of true islamic legal principles."
7740,justice,"in the course of seeking justice through the courts, leila’s family became destitute."
7741,taken,"her mother had taken to sitting outside the courthouse each day in a white shroud, silently holding up a placard that described what had happened to her daughter."
7742,justice,"as i recounted more fully in iran awakening, i took on their case, and while i did not manage to secure anything like justice, their ordeal shaped the sort of legal response that became my second career."
7743,case,"though the judge in leila’s case accused me of contravening islam in my arguments, i drew on islamic law and principles to challenge him."
7744,law,"i discovered that many judges in the islamic republic had little or no understanding of islamic legal tenets, and also that many iranian women had no idea of how egregiously the law discriminated against them."
7745,death,"it was only when life dragged them to some dark crossroads—divorce, the death of a child, a fight over inheritance—that they realized how little status they had before the law."
7746,case,"i made a showcase out of leila’s case, writing articles and speaking out publicly, and extensive coverage in the iranian press soon led to a public outcry."
7747,criminal,"in one article i described how the criminal code around blood money holds that if a man suffers an injury that damages his testicles, he receives compensation equal to a woman’s life."
7748,question,"i posed the question this way: if a woman with a phd is run over by a car and dies, and an illiterate thug gets his testicle hurt in a fight, the value of that woman’s life and that thug’s testicle are equal."
7749,question,"for the first time since the revolution, the question of women’s equality before the law came into the national spotlight."
7750,injustice,"i saw then how sympathetic iranian society was to such injustice and how powerful public outrage could be; more than anything else, it made the authorities pay attention."
7751,justice,"it was then that i started on the course that i follow to this day, seeking justice in the law through upholding the rights of those most vulnerable—women, children, dissidents, and minorities—and pushing for legal change on the battlefield of public sentiment."
7752,power,"it vests absolute power in an unelected supreme leader, harasses independent-minded clerics who challenge the religious basis of its severe islamic rule, and pursues policies that are ideologically radical and detached from the national interests of the iranian people."
7753,power,"but like any regime committed to perpetuating its own power, it has on some occasions shown sensitivity to the condemnation of the international community and the brewing discontent of its own citizens."
7754,state,"the iranian state did everything it could to suppress the news of my award, forbidding the state radio and tv stations to so much as mention it and putting me under an even more severe news embargo."
7755,power,"when a reporter asked president mohammad khatami, a reformist who was in power at the time, why he had not congratulated me, he responded, “this isn’t such an important prize."
7756,case,"it’s only the nobel in literature that really matters.”  but as is always the case with iran, there are ways to get around official censorship."
7757,building,"that day in 2003, rahnavard greeted me at the campus lecture theater, a tall building of yellow brick surrounded by wide lawns dotted with young women reading under sycamore trees."
7758,where,"we were discussing where to put the lectern when the doors at the back of the auditorium flew open and a mob of about thirty women, their heads covered by black chadors, poured in, shouting angrily."
7759,state,they were clearly not students; they were vigilantes supported by the state.
7760,police,"i don’t believe that police should set foot on university grounds, but there’s no other choice,” she said to me."
7761,police,the police arrived and forcibly escorted the mob of women away.
7762,officers,"we shook hands warmly, and then two officers who had stayed behind walked me safely off university grounds."
7763,authorities,"nothing ever came of the incident, the authorities made no arrests, and we never found out exactly who had dispatched the women to disrupt my lecture that day."
7764,authorities,rahnavard threatened to resign if the authorities didn’t find and prosecute those responsible.
7765,prisoners,"i purchased an apartment that would serve as the headquarters for the defenders of human rights center, the organization i had founded to bring numerous lawyers inside the country together to defend political prisoners and to promote the legal and human rights of iranian citizens."
7766,state,the center was the most effective force challenging the iranian government’s political repression; it also functioned as a legal aid network for dissidents and victims of state repression.
7767,prisoners,i also deposited some of the money in a high-interest bank account in iran and distributed the interest income among the families of political prisoners who were living with one breadwinner in prison and badly needed help.
7768,authorities,"since the islamic authorities had stripped me of my judgeship in 1980, i had not been able to earn income and save money for their education, and the legal work i began to undertake in the 1990s, defending children’s and women’s rights, was almost entirely pro bono."
7769,arrested,"we wanted to assure them that if they were arrested because of their pro-democracy activities or for speaking their minds about citizens’ rights or some other sensitive issue, they would know they’d have access to a group of lawyers who would defend them without asking for a fee and would help look after their families."
7770,detention,"we dedicated a great deal of time and care to them and included only abuses that were documented and verified, such as cases of arbitrary detention and harassment of activists."
7771,authorities,"they were the first reports of this kind to be published inside iran by an iranian organization, and they soon became a staple resource for the united nations and other international human rights groups, prompting the authorities to scrutinize the center’s activities even more aggressively."
7772,arrest,"we held training courses for those whose background or activities made them particularly vulnerable to arrest—student activists, religious and ethnic minorities, and journalists."
7773,detained,"we taught them about their rights should they be detained, and how to navigate the judicial process in order to secure furloughs and, sometimes, early release."
7774,city council,"with the moderate majority absent, the conservatives easily swept the election, and the city council, composed of traditionalists and hard-liners, chose ahmadinejad to run tehran."
7775,war,"ahmadinejad declared that the martyrs of the iran-iraq war deserved greater public commemoration, and he ordered that newly found remains of the war dead would be buried in seventy-two of the capital’s parks and squares."
7776,where,"the tehran where i had spent my youth as a college student, including the parks where my husband and i had walked hand in hand during our courtship and where i had taken my girls to play when they were small, was going to be transformed into a haphazard cemetery."
7777,state,"the city’s green parks provided the few spaces where friends and couples could go to spend their free time, and given the state’s strict social codes—the ban on western films and music, the filtering of the internet, and frequent raids on coffee shops—the parks were particularly precious."
7778,police,"he sent flag-draped coffins bearing veterans’ remains even into tehran’s universities, and clashes erupted between furious students and the police and municipal undertakers."
7779,freedom,"the students knew that the burials were intended to send a pointed message to them: that freedom of thought, education, and the physical space of the university itself belonged to the revolution and its martyrs."
7780,state,slowly tehran became the canvas on which ahmadinejad expressed his radical vision for the state.
7781,building,"one afternoon, while driving, i looked up to see an enormous mural on the side of a building."
7782,state,"this, it seemed, was the state’s only vision of gender equality."
7783,charge,"but the extraordinary way in which ahmadinejad was taking charge of the city, remaking it to fit his extremist view of the world, filled me with sadness."
7784,question,"a few weeks later, he walked into my tehran courtroom wearing a white suit and pretended to need my opinion on an obscure legal question."
7785,law,"he was an electrical engineer whose work didn’t involve fine points of civil law, but he was keen for us to get to know each other."
7786,law,"when i stopped practicing law, javad was supportive, just as he was in the early 1990s, when i began to take on human rights cases."
7787,authorities,"the authorities had monitored me closely since the 1990s, when my legal defense of women and children started getting national attention."
7788,wall,"once when we were having trouble with our office phone lines, an electrician took the cover off the phone socket in the wall and found two listening devices, bugs as small as watch batteries, attached to the wires."
7789,state,"the state said it feared for my security and assigned me two full-time bodyguards; they were ostensibly there to protect me, but i knew their real purpose was to monitor my work, to report back on every person i met and spoke with."
7790,building,"like many iranian families, we shared a building with relatives, and when i visited my mother in her apartment one floor beneath ours, as i did most evenings after dinner, i wondered if they had also bugged her rooms, monitoring the movements and opinions of a seventy-year-old woman."
7791,state,i had known this since that day in 1999 when i was going through the government files for a case i was preparing on behalf of the family of two murdered dissidents and i saw my name on the list of targets for state assassination.
7792,where,"fortunately, not long after, news came that negar had been admitted to georgia tech, and she would soon head to georgia, where she and behnud would start their life together."
7793,authorities,"by law, the city’s hotels and restaurants were not permitted to allow men and women to mix together, even for a wedding party, and the authorities often raided receptions and parties in private homes in tehran, fining and arresting guests or demanding bribes."
7794,war,"an estimated sixteen million mines are left over from the war with iraq, waiting to explode beneath an unsuspecting farmer or child."
7795,state,"the state could pursue mine removal more seriously, and it could also join the ottawa convention, which demands that states halt the production and deployment of land mines."
7796,building,"on a cloudy afternoon in february 2004, a middle-aged man came to my personal law office, on the ground floor of my apartment building, and identified himself as a government official."
7797,state,"the most technologically effective demining tools, he said, qualified as “dual-use” goods, meaning that iran could also use them for military purposes, and therefore international sanctions made it impossible for the state to import such devices."
7798,where,"i listened patiently, leaning into the beige floral upholstery of the armchair, wondering where the conversation would lead."
7799,term,"“well, it can be used for making centrifuges.”  at that time, iran’s nuclear program and all its associated technical complications were not matters of daily debate in the media, so the term “centrifuge” didn’t immediately connote anything for me."
7800,where,"besides, i had no idea where i would even begin the search to buy—in bulk, at that—some obscure part that could fit into a centrifuge."
7801,situation,i gave a speech about land mines and briefed the conference participants about the situation in iran.
7802,arrest,"apart from aung san suu kyi, who at the time was under house arrest, all the other living women laureates were on board with the proposal, and we formally launched the nobel women’s initiative in 2006."
7803,evin,"—  one afternoon in the spring of 2005, i drove to evin prison to visit some of my clients."
7804,evin,"evin sits close to the base of the alborz mountains, and it was one of those clear days when the mountains towered over the city, a hulk of pristine white snow above the brown, slushy streets."
7805,evin,"as the car turned down the street toward the prison, past low-slung, cement apartment buildings and the white honeycombed block that was the old hilton hotel, i pushed my own faded memories of evin out of my mind."
7806,court,"the prison is where i spent three weeks in detention in 2000, after a court charged me with spreading evidence of the state’s complicity in an attack on students the previous year."
7807,prisoners,my persistence in meeting these prisoners seemed to irritate the state.
7808,court,"just two weeks prior, i had received a summons to appear before a revolutionary court."
7809,court,"the letter itself did not specify what, if any, charges the court was considering against me."
7810,penal,"this contravened the country’s penal code, and i chose to defy the order."
7811,court,"not much happened after that; a judiciary spokesman told reporters that the revolutionary court had sent the summons in error, and that a public court would deal with the matter."
7812,evin,"that day as i sat in evin’s waiting room, i saw a small, wiry man with fierce eyes lurking about the corridor."
7813,imprisoned,"it was akbar ganji, a prominent reformist journalist who had been imprisoned for his investigative articles that uncovered state complicity in a string of assassinations."
7814,state,"like many reformists, he had come from within the very belly of the system, a former revolutionary guardsman who had somehow been transformed into the islamic republic’s bob woodward, responsible for the investigative journalism that shook the state’s very foundations."
7815,sentenced,in 2000 the authorities arrested him for allegedly violating press laws and undermining national security and sentenced him to ten years in prison.
7816,evin,"now, forgotten inside evin, he seemed to be expecting no one."
7817,where,where’s your lawyer?” i asked.
7818,case,“my lawyer didn’t even say hello to me last time i saw him.”  “do you want us to take over your case?
7819,power,i opened my briefcase and wrote out a power-of-attorney document on the spot.
7820,case,"ganji signed it, and we took on his case."
7821,lawyer,i saw him three or four times after becoming his lawyer.
7822,authorities,"after he announced that, the prison authorities wouldn’t let me see him anymore."
7823,abuse,"perhaps more than any other official in living memory, mortazavi is associated in the minds of the public with abuse and a sadistic passion for punishing dissidents and critics."
7824,assault,"he is widely believed to have presided over the 2003 prison assault on iranian-canadian photojournalist zahra kazemi, who later died of her injuries."
7825,court,"most journalists and politicians who passed through his courts in those years have stories of the cruel, insane, and often idiotic things he said to them in court."
7826,lawyer,i think it would be fair to say that he did not particularly appreciate me as a lawyer.
7827,punishment,"a couple of days into the hunger strike, mortazavi publicly told reporters that hunger strikes were illegal under iranian law and that as a result, the authorities were denying ganji visitations and phone calls as punishment."
7828,case,"the next time a journalist called me to ask about the case, i raised the issue of bobby sands street."
7829,authorities,"in 1981, the new islamic authorities had renamed churchill boulevard, which ran along the british embassy, bobby sands street, in honor of the ira hunger striker, whom the revolutionaries celebrated as a “freedom fighter.”  “why have the authorities named one of the most important streets of tehran after bobby sands?” i asked."
7830,inside,"“how come outside the country a hunger strike is heroic and brave, but it is forbidden inside iran?”  at this, judge mortazavi grew livid."
7831,ordered,"he filed a complaint against me, accusing me of spreading lies, and ordered a restriction on my movements, forbidding me to leave tehran."
7832,authorities,let me visit him and confirm.”  the authorities didn’t let me visit ganji.
7833,case,"i did all i could, as was so often the case when legally i had no recourse; i gave interviews and led a media campaign, trying to conjure international outrage."
7834,term,"the newspaper was closed, i was not even permitted to visit him, and khatami’s term was over."
7835,sink,"on the eve of the 2005 presidential election, i was calmly cleaning parsley and cilantro in a sink full of water so i could cook one of the favorite dishes of my younger daughter, nargess, for dinner."
7836,authorities,"iran’s elections have largely been clean, if only because the process of vetting candidates is itself dirty: high clerical authorities vet candidates and permit only those figures they consider acceptable to make it onto the ballot."
7837,stretch,"as a result, there is real rivalry between some figures, but it is not a truly democratic process by any stretch."
7838,law,"nargess was still living at home; though she had been admitted to mcgill university in canada to study international law, i had persuaded her to first sit for the bar exam in tehran, then move abroad."
7839,lawyer,"in order to become a fully licensed lawyer in iran, you must first pass the bar, then complete an apprenticeship, so she had a gap year before starting in canada."
7840,state,but nargess had always found the state’s social restrictions and the bullying atmosphere difficult.
7841,police,"she hated when i told her not to laugh so loudly in public—i didn’t want her to attract the attention of the morality police, but she still felt indignant at being scolded for such a natural behavior."
7842,justice,she had a profound sense of justice and chafed at unfair restrictions.
7843,state,"during ramazan, when the state forbade eating in public, she would always complain at having to hide her head in my handbag to take a bite from a sandwich."
7844,law,"we talked about negar, who was about to move to georgia, and nargess’s own plans to study law."
7845,building,"as we got out, two young men stepped out of the shadows of a nearby building."
7846,inside,"once we were inside the house, the girls hung up their coats and head scarves and were soon back to laughing and chatting and dissecting the party, as though nothing had happened."
7847,case,i didn’t believe for a moment that those two men had wanted to discuss a case with me.
7848,imprisoned,i remembered what one of the interrogators had said to me when i was imprisoned in evin.
7849,confinement,"it had only been three weeks in solitary confinement, but the girls had been younger then, and i had been desperate to get out."
7850,criminal,"“don’t you miss your daughters?” he had asked, looking at me with contempt, as though i had done something terrible to land myself in a prison, not only a criminal but a neglectful mother."
7851,where,"i didn’t fall asleep that night until very late, and twice i tiptoed down the hall to peer into the room where the girls slept."
7852,building,"—  iran’s interior ministry is located in a looming brown 1970s-style building on fatemi street, named for hossein fatemi, the politician who in the early 1950s helped prime minister mohammad mossadegh nationalize iranian oil and gas."
7853,conviction,"in their place, we gained the conviction that the united states wished iran harm."
7854,arrested,"after the coup, the shah’s men arrested fatemi and executed him by firing squad."
7855,war,"in the wake of the 1979 revolution, most of the city’s streets had been renamed after shia saints, islamic revolutionaries, or, later, war martyrs, but fatemi had remained fatemi."
7856,state,"we had founded the center in 2001, and legally the constitution did not oblige us to request a state license for our activities."
7857,authorities,"but as with much of everything that went on in iran, the authorities applied and invoked the law selectively, molding it to fit their political aims and, often, to quiet their opponents."
7858,state,"i was not an opponent of the state—i was a human rights defender, and i based my criticisms of the state on legal grounds."
7859,authorities,"but authoritarian governments are not fond of shades of gray; they cannot tolerate any criticism at all, and so i knew that at some stage, the authorities might quibble with the center’s status."
7860,trial,"he had wanted to meet with me, he explained, to ask whether i would consider serving as a judge in saddam hussein’s trial."
7861,detention,"the u.s. military had captured saddam at the end of 2003, and he had remained in detention since then, awaiting trial for the various atrocities he committed during his long years running iraq, from using chemical weapons against iraqi kurds to crushing the shia villages in iraq’s south."
7862,sentence,"“he needs to be tried in an international criminal court, a proper tribunal.”  “but a tribunal won’t hand down a death sentence,” he said."
7863,trial,"“well, if you’re determined to execute him in advance of a trial, i can’t be a part of that.”  our conversation ended there."
7864,court,"but i could not participate in a kangaroo court, when it was precisely that sort of abrogation of justice i had spent my life in iran challenging."
7865,power,"in september 2005, not many weeks into his presidency, ahmadinejad walked up to the podium at the united nations general assembly and declared that iran had the right to nuclear power and would defy america’s “nuclear apartheid.” he ended his address with a prayer, predicting that the last imam of shia islam would soon emerge."
7866,law,"she would often spread her law books out on the table in the evenings, and we would work together side by side, one of us occasionally rising to pour more tea or bring out a bowl of dried mulberries."
7867,law,"when she had studied law at shahid beheshti university, a top law school, i had looked over her assignments and coursework with curiosity, to see how law was being taught under the islamic republic."
7868,criminal,"when i had been a law student, in the 1960s, we had carefully studied key principles of islamic sharia, despite the fact that the shah had instituted a secular criminal and civil code."
7869,sharia,"after the revolution, one would have expected the universities to expand and enhance their teaching of sharia, since the new regime had replaced the shah’s secular legal system with islamic law."
7870,sharia,but nargess was learning less than half of what i had learned about sharia principles in my own student days.
7871,case,why was this the case?
7872,sharia,"essentially because the crafters of the islamic republic’s education system did not want to teach students the subtleties of sharia law, philosophy, and tradition."
7873,justice,"i was constantly giving interviews, meeting new clients, and generally functioning more than ever as a repository for those seeking justice."
7874,state,"i can’t perform miracles, but i will make use of all the channels and loudspeakers at my disposal to convey your voice to the rest of the world.”  in the evenings, nargess and i would often interrupt our work to watch the news, both the state broadcaster’s newscast and the bbc persian service, to learn what was transpiring around the world."
7875,state,the state news often carried images of ahmadinejad’s trips around the country.
7876,state,"during his visits, ahmadinejad would give speeches to a rural crowd overcome with admiration, he would wave their letters of complaint before the camera, promising state accountability, and he would then walk through the crowd passing around envelopes of cash, each holding 100,000 tomans (the equivalent, then, of about $50)."
7877,term,"the envelopes, much like a drug habit, offered a balm to hardship in the short term, but they created a far greater problem for the country’s treasury down the line."
7878,power,"during the first two years of his initial four-year term as president, ahmadinejad enjoyed great freedom—he had the unconditional support of the supreme leader, whom the iranian constitution vests with absolute power, and the backing of the country’s hard-line establishment."
7879,power,"when the clerics had taken over iran in 1979 and devised a legal system that vested them with absolute power, the running of the economy had ranked low among their priorities."
7880,state,"one evening, as we were all gathered in the living room watching the news, the state television station broadcast ahmadinejad giving a speech about the country’s promising young scientists."
7881,power,"but it was also profoundly disturbing, the extent to which the president would bend the truth, contort reality, in order to persuade iranians that their country had the right to nuclear power."
7882,state,"—  it was just after lunch on an ordinary wednesday when i glanced at the clock and realized it was nearly time for mr. mahdavi, a state intelligence agent, to drop by for his appointment."
7883,state,"i knew that mahdavi was not his real name—all the state’s intelligence agents concealed their real identities—and though his manner was civil, the simple fact that i was dealing with someone with a fake name unsettled me."
7884,taken,"the letter had read: “if you continue your work, both you and your daughter nargess will be taken care of.”  i hadn’t mentioned the letter to nargess; she already took all the precautions i thought necessary for her safety, and i didn’t want her to feel intimidated or, even worse, resentful at such a young age."
7885,state,"the iranian state ran various intelligence branches, some much more hard-line than others, and they often competed with each other."
7886,arrested,"in early 2005, i had agreed to represent roozbeh mirebrahimi, a journalist and blogger the authorities had arrested in 2004, leveling the various charges they usually brought against reporters who worked for the country’s beleaguered but still functioning independent press."
7887,penal,"in agreeing to represent him, i had repeated publicly that iran’s judicial and penal system was deeply flawed."
7888,state,"“if the state stops behaving badly, then i won’t have anything to say."
7889,state,"but if what i say is being exploited, the root of the problem is the state’s behavior.”  he looked at me that day with some disappointment."
7890,law,"i had been a judge and was now a lawyer, and the law concerns itself with intent and the results of intent."
7891,state,"if the state intended the best for its citizens, then it needed to demonstrate that in its behavior toward them."
7892,arrest,"it could not arrest journalists, throw them in prison, inflict all manner of psychological torture and abuse on them, and then dispatch an agent to talk to me about america “exploiting” my objections to this."
7893,where,"it was unclear from where, but there were shouts of “he’s been shot!,” and then it was mayhem, as the attackers and the mourners scattered in every direction."
7894,state,"that night, the state television news service announced that despite the sacredness of the holy day of ashura, the sufis had converged at their prayer hall to drink alcohol and have illicit sex."
7895,state,"just over a year into ahmadinejad’s tenure, his administration and cronies were giving free rein to the religious extremists that filled the ranks of the state’s voluntary militias."
7896,state,"though the members of these militias did not draw formal state salaries, they received endless financial perks, from low-interest loans to mortgages to use of government cars."
7897,state,"they did not wear uniforms, but they were supported by the state security forces, and they often acted independently of the police."
7898,state,"often the militias mobilized as a vigilante force, breaking up lectures and events they deemed critical of the state, as well as setting up their own morality checkpoints, harassing young people who had western music or alcohol in their cars, and raiding private parties."
7899,power,"while president khatami was in power, he had sought to rein in the militias, demanding more lawfulness and a respect for people’s privacy."
7900,state,"but ahmadinejad reversed this course and instead began egging the militias on, encouraging their most intolerant attitudes and giving them subtle signals that should they wish to punish those who deviated from their strict view of islam, the state would not get in their way."
7901,state,"the sufis, whose mystical practice of islam emerged in the eighth century, posed no real threat to the state, though their numbers were considerable."
7902,state,"the more hard-line state clergy and the government did not appreciate the sufis; they considered them somehow deviant, just as they considered anyone who practiced a more tolerant, more flexible interpretation of islam deviant."
7903,authorities,"the authorities had banned the sufis from practicing their traditional whirling dance, as well as a number of their most colorful practices, like walking through flames without getting burned or being pierced without drawing blood."
7904,state,"it was unthinkable that his followers would have been drinking and womanizing in a prayer hall, let alone on the day of ashura, as all the reports in the state-controlled newspapers alleged."
7905,court,"they said that a few of the wounded sufis had lodged a complaint with the qom magistrate’s court against some of the assailants, whose identities had been determined, and also the men who had ordered the assault."
7906,guilty,"instead, he tore up the document before their eyes and told them that as the guilty parties they had no such legal recourse."
7907,case,“take the case to mrs. ebadi and ask her to represent us.
7908,state,"iranians who were committed to islam but alienated from the official mosques, which they associated with state corruption and hypocrisy, were attracted to their order."
7909,state,"as a religious alternative, at a time when iranians were increasingly turning away from mosques and state prayer, the sufi religion offered a vibrant islamic alternative."
7910,authority,"the cleric, whose own speeches and ceremonies were no longer well attended, had demanded that the hosseiniyeh be placed under his authority."
7911,state,"ultimately, the simmering envy of a few influential clerics had prompted a group of state-supported vigilantes, along with their clerical backers, to attack the sufis that day."
7912,case,"i immediately agreed to act as the wounded sufis’ attorney, and i asked two of my colleagues to take on the case with me."
7913,lawyer,"one was a lawyer from qom, mohammad seyfzadeh, whose local influence i thought might prove useful."
7914,power,"the next day seyfzadeh visited the office of the prosecutor of the city of qom, carrying a power-of-attorney letter signed by both of us and the three visitors from qom."
7915,case,"on that occasion, upon seeing my name, the prosecutor did not tear anything up and instead opened a case file."
7916,sentenced,"seyfzadeh, who would later be sentenced to six years in prison for his legal activities, requested that the victims hurt during the attack be examined immediately by a forensic doctor, to document their injuries before they healed."
7917,court,"but the court, in a delaying tactic, asked him to return the following day; when he did, he was told that the file had been sent to tehran to be handled by the special court for clergy."
7918,court,"it took two months to refer the case to tehran, and when i followed up i was told precisely what i had been expecting to hear: that neither i nor any of my colleagues had the right to represent the case, because we were not clerics, and that it would be handled by the special court for clergy."
7919,court,"this separate court effectively worked to shield clerics from the law, much as diplomatic immunity protects diplomats from being prosecuted for all manner of wrongdoing."
7920,case,so the final outcome of this disturbing and tragic case had really been determined from the outset.
7921,state,"and after that, the state’s relations with the sufis deteriorated sharply."
7922,imprisoned,"hundreds of sufi followers in cities and towns across iran were arrested, and even this mild, peaceful section of society found itself besieged and imprisoned, made an enemy target by the state."
7923,police,"just a few minutes before four o’clock, the key organizers, who had arrived early, noticed a small convoy of green-and-white police cars heading down from the north side of the square."
7924,police,"out of several police vans flooded policewomen in severe, head-to-toe black chadors."
7925,police,"but suddenly there were police officers everywhere, shouting for everyone to disperse but not letting anyone get away."
7926,police,male police officers attacked the men in the crowd.
7927,assault,"her face, they said, contorted in rage as she strode from assault to assault."
7928,police,"when women collapsed from the tear gas, the policewoman grabbed them by their head scarves and dragged them along the pavement toward the police vans."
7929,authorities,"the authorities put down the protest before it even got started, crushing it with a violence no one had anticipated."
7930,arrested,"they injured a number of the protesters and arrested a number of the key organizers, even ali akbar moussavi khoeini, a reformist former member of parliament who had come out in solidarity with the women."
7931,arrested,"in the days after the crushed protest, the tehran public prosecutor declared that the arrested protesters were accused of disturbing public order, fostering tension and unrest, and spreading lies."
7932,police,"the police had, of course, known about the protest in advance; the organizers had posted the date and time on their website, for they felt they had nothing to hide."
7933,state,the activists met shortly afterward to discuss what had happened and to devise a new strategy that the state would tolerate.
7934,imprisoned,"a feminist movement that was locked up, imprisoned, and not permitted to organize, they knew, would be of little benefit to anyone."
7935,exercise,"as i have experienced so often myself, being crushed simply gives you greater exercise in collecting the shards of yourself, putting them back together, and figuring out what to do next."
7936,building,"the trees outside the building were thick with green leaves, and the sun was shining so brightly that i flicked off the office lights."
7937,state,"it felt like all the efforts that women like me had made in the early years of the revolution, pushing back against all that discrimination and state bullying, were finally—nearly three decades later—bearing some fruit."
7938,state,"despite the state’s fierce repressiveness—everything from laws that permitted stoning and polygamy to morality police sweeps that harassed women on the street for not dressing conservatively enough—iran had a burgeoning, vibrant women’s movement."
7939,interrogation,"this wasn’t a clique of upper-class women who had studied in europe and were supported by their husbands but a real movement, with centers and seminars and training sessions with titles like “how to cope with interrogation.” though it was not something that i particularly wished to take credit for, it did seem that my receipt of the nobel in 2003 had propelled the women’s activists."
7940,court,"to have a woman just like them, a woman they knew, whom they had seen going in and out of court for years under the islamic republic, be recognized in this way showed them that the world watched and appreciated their efforts."
7941,state,"much of the region was still enamored with political islam, and in countries like saudi arabia, many women were simply not interested in mounting an open challenge to the state’s patriarchy."
7942,charged,"it needs to be an initiative that traditional and religious people also find themselves drawn to, not just the secularists.”  the two nodded in agreement, but they said they had to discuss this aspect of their outreach with the committee charged with launching the campaign."
7943,court,i made a few minor changes to ensure that all the content was consistently defensible in any court of law.
7944,law,divorce law and polygamy?
7945,custody,inheritance and child custody?
7946,authorities,"as to which set of laws you should start with, i think this is something you’d best ask the signatories.”  —  when it came to launching the campaign, the authorities refused the women a legal permit to hold their meeting in a public place or assembly hall."
7947,building,"but two hours before the start of the meeting, security officials warned the owner of the office building that such a meeting should not go ahead."
7948,locked,"everyone gradually began to arrive, and they faced a locked door."
7949,authorities,"what this proved was something deeply distressing to the authorities: that the demand for legal reform extended to women across the country, across class, geography, and social background."
7950,state,"the campaign’s great success was to develop and build women’s awareness around key legal issues like equitable inheritance rights and inflation adjustment for dowries—these were areas that had the support of traditional and more secular-minded women alike, and the mounting pressure, plus the many thousands of accumulating signatures, made the state deeply nervous."
7951,authorities,"across the country, the authorities began going after activists, from senior leaders to even occasional participants."
7952,national security,the chief prosecutor accused them of “conspiracy against national security” and the “dissemination of lies” in society.
7953,sentence,"this was because after the officials had carefully scrutinized the handbook, the introduction, and all the material published and distributed by the campaign, they could not find even a single sentence that contravened an accepted tenet of islam."
7954,state,this meant it would be impossible for the state to level charges of antagonism against islam; there was not even enough to get a cleric who was on the state’s payroll to declare that the activists were apostates.
7955,court,"when the activists went to court, i represented a number of them as their defense lawyer."
7956,state,"in one of the trials, i openly challenged the state’s claim that the women’s work had somehow undermined national security."
7957,court,"but with a justice system that had long ago lost its independence, that now walked in step with the whims of a higher, repressive authority, the fact that there was a court process meant very little."
7958,sentenced,"the judiciary sentenced both noushin and parvin to three years in prison, and a number of others also received convictions."
7959,question,"the social aspect is key here, because the feminist activists managed to disentangle the women’s question from the high politics of east versus west, iran versus the world, and the islamic republic versus democracy."
7960,law,"none of this meant that iran’s lawmakers were suddenly liberal and concerned with women standing equally before the law, but they were sensitive enough to public opinion to see that society itself was growing more progressive."
7961,case,"and, as is often the case in iran, iranians managed to either nudge the regime ahead or pull it along with them—i’m not sure which."
7962,police,"a shaken haleh, who couldn’t fly because her iranian passport had been in that stolen bag, returned to her mother’s house and went to the police station in the morning to report the incident."
7963,police,"the police referred her to some security officials, who, in turn, asked a few questions about her work, then let her go."
7964,arrested,"the next time she returned for more questioning, the agents arrested her."
7965,cell,"haleh was a grandmother and close to retirement, a delicate, petite woman whom no one could imagine in an islamic republic prison cell."
7966,prisoner,i explained to him that i had made a pledge to myself never to receive any payment from any political prisoner.
7967,authorities,"but, as usual, the authorities did not permit me to visit haleh; nor did they provide me with the case file to study."
7968,guilt,it was impossible to determine what the authorities believed to be the cause of her guilt.
7969,robbery,and why the staged highway robbery?
7970,arrest,why had they not simply obtained an arrest warrant from the prosecutor and picked her up at home?
7971,officers,"in haleh’s case, the authorities blocked me from speaking to the interrogators who were seeing her regularly, and of course there was little question of my tracking down the intelligence officers handling her case, the ones who made all the decisions."
7972,where,where would i even look for them?
7973,case,"there wasn’t much i could do, but as i certainly needed to do something, i gave interviews about the case to the press, often hourly."
7974,case,i wrote a letter detailing the case to the u.n. high commission on human rights—iran was on the committee that year and i hoped it would release haleh to save itself the embarrassment of having the issue raised during one of the committee’s upcoming meetings.
7975,authorities,"not long after, the authorities released haleh."
7976,arrest,"in the months and years that would follow haleh’s arrest, the iranian state went on to arrest and detain other iranian-american dual citizens."
7977,state,"the policy was, first and foremost, designed by the state to create a bargaining chip with the united states."
7978,power,"that it sought to create bargaining power through such means only highlighted iran’s desperation, as well as its willingness to use the most compromised means possible to achieve its political aims."
7979,building,"—  on a frigid winter morning, i was standing outside our apartment building, bundled in a warm woolen coat, waiting for a young colleague to pick me up."
7980,locked,"a few minutes earlier, my colleague had texted to say she was nearby, and so i had locked up and gone outside, concerned that the ice and snow on our street might give her trouble."
7981,taken,"i might have simply walked up to the main road and taken a taxi, but by that time, the winter of 2007, i no longer went anywhere on my own."
7982,state,"i had dispensed with my state-appointed bodyguards, and during one of my recent trips abroad i had bought a vial of pepper spray, which i kept in my handbag."
7983,authorities,"i knew that the authorities were increasingly displeased with me, and that sooner or later they would choose some way of conveying that more intensely."
7984,state,"i knew the state was desperate to put me on trial for something, but a complaint like this i simply refused to engage with."
7985,power,it was becoming clear that ahmadinejad’s rise to power was inalterably changing everything.
7986,establishment,"the political establishment was growing angrier and more intolerant, and the middlemen and loyalists ahmadinejad had installed across the regime’s many institutions were busy clanging shut any of the small, progressive openings iran had experienced under president khatami."
7987,authorities,"the censorship authorities were aggressively stepping up their controls on what novelists, screenwriters, and academics could publish, and even books that had been vetted and published found themselves back on the censor’s desk."
7988,state,"for activists and organizers, the situation was growing even more bleak, with state harassment of their families, threats from intelligence agents, and warnings of prosecution stepped up by the day."
7989,state,"in its place were arrests of journalists and harassment of dissidents, and this put me in a more fraught relationship with the state."
7990,court,"i was feeling rather low that day, but i said nothing about that as we merged in with the traffic and headed toward the tehran revolutionary court."
7991,court,"everyone who entered the court building had to go through security, and as with all government buildings and public places, there were special lines for men and women."
7992,where,"we walked toward the women’s security section and heard, from behind the curtains where the inspections took place, a booming voice chastising a woman for allowing some locks of hair to show beneath her head scarf."
7993,court,i remembered her from my last visit to the court.
7994,escaped,"no deviation, no matter how minor, escaped this woman’s stern gaze."
7995,law,"my son-in-law has taken a second wife, and he now wants to divorce my daughter."
7996,court,"“did she hassle you?”  “no, not at all.”  while the security guard’s words had saddened me, they also bolstered me as i walked toward the court."
7997,justice,the woman wanted justice for her daughter.
7998,justice,"her words quietly echoed in my mind as we continued down the corridor, a reminder that the quest for justice was one that so many iranians shared, regardless of their differences."
7999,guard,"because i was a repository for people’s grievances, because they sought me out to tell me their sorrows, i knew the security guard’s concerns were just a glimpse into the vast, simmering dissatisfaction that ruled iranian society."
8000,where,"where did all that mistrust and resentment reside, i wondered."
8001,inside,"how could it just lie dormant inside so many people, as they went about their days, their multiple jobs, in this city choked with pollution, waiting and waiting for something to get better?"
8002,building,"—  on another freezing cold winter day, a shoeshine man appeared out of nowhere and set himself up directly across the street from our apartment building."
8003,building,"i never saw him making notes, but he did have a mobile phone, which he used to report on the movements of those going into and out of my building."
8004,authorities,"all the neighbors and local shop owners suspected that the recently arrived newspaper seller was an intelligence agent, installed there by the authorities to, like the shoe shiner, monitor the comings and goings from my office."
8005,detainees,"although the authorities handled their surveillance so crudely that my neighbors and friends made jokes, it unnerved me to think that vulnerable families of detainees, potential clients, and activists already sentenced and out on furlough would come to meet me imagining that they were going to a private meeting when, in fact, their faces and identities would quickly be recorded and uploaded to the state’s security bodies."
8006,crime,"one afternoon, a client who had spent some time in prison for a political crime arrived for a visit."
8007,court,"then he told me, “when i was just walking past the kiosk, i saw one of the revolutionary court’s interrogators."
8008,inside,"he was inside, talking to the newsagent."
8009,situation,"as the tehran winter turned to spring and the snow melted off the tops of the alborz mountains, the political situation continued to darken."
8010,authorities,"around this time, the authorities forced javad to retire."
8011,guilt,there was still the possibility of working as a consultant—this didn’t have to be the end of his professional life—but i nevertheless felt a deep sadness and guilt.
8012,state,it was an early sign that the state would not permit us to flourish together.
8013,authorities,"the authorities in tehran had recently rounded up seven leaders of the baha’i faith, and the community was shaken to its core."
8014,state,"since 1979, the state has executed more than two hundred baha’is simply for their religious beliefs."
8015,arrested,"when the community leaders were arrested, no lawyer dared take on their case."
8016,state,"no one, even lawyers who represent feminists and democracy activists, will take on baha’i cases, because the state’s hatred and extreme sensitivity are so entrenched that the consequences, lawyers fear, will be too dangerous."
8017,arrested,"that is why the families of those arrested came to me, and i agreed to act as their attorney."
8018,case,"not long after i had accepted their case, a number of hard-line websites began reporting that my daughter nargess had converted to bahaism."
8019,death,"under the islamic republic’s strict interpretation of islamic law, converting out of islam amounts to apostasy, which is punishable by death."
8020,case,"they were trying to scare me into dropping the case, perhaps laying out some sort of trap."
8021,arrest,"since then, montazeri had evolved into one of iran’s most liberal clerics, though the regime harassed him intensely and kept him under virtual house arrest."
8022,defendants,"the prosecutor had said that the defendants could not meet with their lawyers until the end of the investigations; furthermore, i was not permitted to study the files or have access to the allegations against them."
8023,freedom,"i believe in freedom of religion, and islam defends that right.”  he looked at me stonily, so i felt emboldened to continue."
8024,law,"so, keep your religion for yourself, and i will keep my religion for myself too.’ so what is the meaning of this koranic verse?”  “it’s a pity that the law does not allow it."
8025,law,"if the law permitted me, i wouldn’t show mercy even to their children."
8026,court,"they told me that the security officials, including the lead investigator, had promised to show them leniency in court if they agreed to fire me as their lawyer."
8027,case,"my clients did not agree, and after they lingered in prison for another few months, i was finally allowed to study the case files."
8028,national security,the prosecutor had accused them of spying for america and israel and conspiring against national security.
8029,guilt,but their files did not contain any evidence or even reasoning that might point to their guilt.
8030,state,"it was clear that they were being punished for their religious beliefs, but because it would cause such international condemnation to prosecute them on these grounds, the state had leveled espionage charges."
8031,criminal,"iranian criminal law does not formally consider being a baha’i an offense, and because the courts had no evidence of spying, these baha’is should have been released."
8032,court,"but the iranian court sentenced my clients, five men and two women, to twenty years in prison, where they remain to this day."
8033,law,"—  it was high summer, the whirring air conditioners of the neighborhood creating a collective hum that i could hear from my law office."
8034,freedom,"during times of conflict, or just a sense of impending conflict, it’s nearly impossible to focus on rights like freedom of expression, or the right to an education."
8035,power,“i’m not interested in political power at all.
8036,war,"we had set up the group during the presidency of george w. bush, when his government spoke incessantly of war against iran."
8037,transferred,"i’ve transferred ownership to the center as an endowment, and the board decides who should enter, not me.”  “do you have that endowment document handy?” he said, smiling with fake pleasantness."
8038,state,"i had never, in all my years defending people the state persecuted, come across another instance where one intelligence agent had dedicated his career to the ruining of a single individual."
8039,charged,"he worked in the security branch of the ministry of intelligence, charged with the “security file,” which concerned people like me: activists, critics, people seen as enemies."
8040,case,"he called himself a “case specialist” or, sometimes, an “intelligence officer.” during interrogations he had a habit of mimicking people."
8041,lawyer,"“ ‘i want a lawyer,’ ” he’d say, inflecting his voice with his victim’s cadence and manner of speech."
8042,interrogation,"i knew this because he paused one interrogation to take a call, speaking kindly to a little girl, promising to bring her something when he got home."
8043,war,"—  on december 10, 2008, my organization had planned a celebration for the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, the charter the u.n. general assembly passed in 1948 in the wake of world war ii, designed to enshrine the basic rights of individuals everywhere."
8044,freedom,"as we did each year, we would also present an award to a prominent iranian activist who had worked for democracy and freedom of expression."
8045,serving,"that year, the award was going to ezzatollah sahabi, one of iran’s longest-serving activists, an advocate of political and citizens’ rights, who was turning seventy-eight."
8046,building,the front door to the building was wide open.
8047,court,"“regrettably, by order of the revolutionary court, we must close down this office immediately.”  “do you have a warrant from the prosecutor?"
8048,warrant,"did you even have a warrant to enter the premises?”  “the door was open, and we just walked in."
8049,warrant,"we have no warrant, but the prosecutor gave us verbal orders.”  “i’m not accepting that.” i moved to stand before the doors to the terrace."
8050,where,"the taller agent, who had an angry rash under his stubble, put a hand on his hip, where i knew he was concealing a weapon."
8051,arrest,"“we don’t want any trouble, and we don’t want to arrest anyone."
8052,law,"in the islamic republic of iran, the orders of the ministry of intelligence and the security apparatus always outweighed the law."
8053,arrest,"i had dealt with many cases where people resisted arrest or challenged agents, demanding to see a warrant."
8054,officers,"“handcuff her!” the cameraman shouted, motioning to the other officers."
8055,arrested,"whatever happened that afternoon, i didn’t want jinoos to get arrested."
8056,police,"if she ended up at the police station, they would discover that she was a baha’i, and she could end up spending years in prison."
8057,building,"they looked around nervously, and one of them told us that a row of security officers were now standing outside the building, trying to prevent people from entering."
8058,officers,"as the officers shoved them back, one woman, a director, stumbled backward and fell into the street."
8059,police,"an officer grabbed his arms, and another handcuffed them and pushed him into a waiting police car."
8060,inside,the lead officer inside cleared his throat loudly.
8061,charge,"we’ve asked you politely, but if you don’t start to move, we’ll throw you out.” a few more officers entered the room, flanking the angry one who seemed to be in charge."
8062,police,"i fumbled in my purse for my mobile phone, to call the local police station."
8063,warrant,"“there are some men at my office, and they don’t even have a warrant."
8064,officers,"they’re trying to kick my colleagues and me out of our private property.”  the officers were listening to my call, clearly furious."
8065,officers,"“this comes straight from the ministry of intelligence.”  i looked at the officers, growing restless and impatient, striding about the office and shoving papers around desks."
8066,arrest,they likely would not dare to arrest me.
8067,police,"it was approaching dusk, the shadows fading on the police cars that still lined the street."
8068,building,"it was a safe, social space where those building their society came together to debate and share news, often sitting under the trees on the spacious terrace, smoking and talking."
8069,arrested,"—  despite my efforts to keep jinoos safe that evening, a week later the authorities discovered that she was a baha’i and arrested her at her home."
8070,imprisoned,"the authorities detained her for about a year, and sometime after her release, they imprisoned her father, for no reason other than his faith."
8071,authorities,"i tried to contact various authorities to unseal the doors, just so we could return the equipment."
8072,court,"the authorities never made the case against the center public, never sent it to court, and never gave me access to the file, so i could see what wrongdoing had been alleged against us."
8073,court,"the investigator said the evidence was classified and that it would only be divulged to the court, which, of course, was never consulted on the matter."
8074,building,"not long after the authorities permitted us that one hour of access, i ran into the building’s manager on the street."
8075,where,"it was a blustery afternoon, the wind whipping the trash along the gutters, steam rising up from the pyramid of fava beans a street vendor was cooking next to the kiosk where i had stopped to buy a newspaper."
8076,building,"“khanoum ebadi, now that i see you, there’s something i wanted to mention,” the building manager said."
8077,wall,"realizing that just on the other side of the wall, all these months, had been a ministry of intelligence listening post made me angrier than i could have imagined."
8078,authorities,"with the center formally shut down, or at least physically shut down, the authorities imagined they were putting a stop to our work."
8079,law,but we almost immediately began working out of my personal law office.
8080,warrant,but they had what was effectively a warrant.
8081,lawyer,"people trust me, they come to see me as a lawyer, and they share very personal information."
8082,court,"i can’t let you have access to that.”  “sorry, but we have a warrant from the court, too,” the tall one said, pulling out another piece of paper."
8083,authority,you have no authority over us.” and they proceeded to push their way inside.
8084,police,"once again, i rang the police station."
8085,officers,"please come immediately!”  within minutes the siren wailed down the street, and two officers, including the station commander, came bounding up to the door."
8086,police,"and i’ll only allow them to take away files if you, as the police station commander, formally testify in the official procès-verbal of the event that they removed material from my office against my objections and protest.”  he agreed."
8087,officers,"we compiled a procès-verbal, and the intelligence officers carried away two large cardboard boxes full of any documents that had drawn their attention."
8088,abuse,"what they were looking for, what they were hoping to find amid all those papers documenting the abuse of critics of the regime, was some piece of paper that might prove i was a spy."
8089,prisoners,"that i had links with foreigners, and that some faraway government was funding my work; that every month, the american government deposited a check into some imaginary bank account, as payment for my defense of iranian political prisoners."
8090,locked,"i noticed javad becoming more cautious, always checking twice or three times in the evenings that our front door was double-locked."
8091,state,"but while i felt the state circling ever closer, it was a reality i most often chose not to think about, in order to simply cope with the passing days."
8092,illegal,“i’m not doing anything illegal.
8093,law,"with the next secretary, a law graduate who was preparing to sit for the bar exam, they threatened to deny her license to practice law."
8094,law,"i practiced pro bono law, and compared to the going rate in iran, the salary of a secretary in the states was considerable."
8095,authorities,"and so began the long months where i would plan my days around walking to a public phone—i didn’t want to call her on a landline or my mobile, which the authorities would be tapping—to ring washington, d.c., eight and a half hours behind."
8096,state,"—  perhaps i should have seen it coming, should have acknowledged to myself how the state’s animosity toward me was mounting steadily."
8097,death,“death to the american mercenary!
8098,death,"death to the traitor ebadi!”  there were so many voices, it sounded like a whole demonstration."
8099,locked,"i was too nervous to go to the window, so i locked the office door and fled to my home, upstairs."
8100,where,"i ran into the kitchen, where a smaller window, covered by a thin lace curtain, looked out onto the street."
8101,inside,"“i’m going to go close the inside door,” said javad, walking swiftly out of the apartment."
8102,building,our building had a large metal internal door that could be shut from the inside.
8103,police,"with trembling hands, i dialed the local police station."
8104,building,"“there are men outside shouting, attacking my building."
8105,building,two men were using a metal bar to pry the sign for my law office off the building.
8106,building,others had taken out cans of spray paint and were busy spraying—i could only imagine obscenities—across the walls of the building.
8107,police,"a moment later a police car appeared, slowing as it approached the scene."
8108,building,"“wait—where are you going?”  “the police are here now; i’m going to talk to them.”  i watched from my spot at the window as javad approached the two policemen, waving at the building."
8109,state,they were members of one of the state’s hard-line volunteer militias.
8110,state,"these were the men the state dispatched when it wanted to brutalize dissidents, attack european embassies, raid feminist demonstrations, or otherwise bully iranians yet keep itself distanced from that repression."
8111,state,"by sending in the voluntary militias, the state maintained some measure of plausible deniability, and it often called the militiamen “students.” because of this setup, the militiamen who attacked our building were permitted by the police to wreak their havoc; this was why the police confiscated our neighbor’s camera but not the thugs’ cans of spray paint."
8112,wall,"the attackers had written “america crone” on the wall and had misspelled the persian for “crone,” ajooz."
8113,state,the irony here was that the state claimed that “students” had been responsible for the attack.
8114,police,"the news reports began reverberating internationally, enough so that two weeks later, the police officers who had merely observed the attack came to my office."
8115,building,“can you please get your building repainted?” one officer asked.
8116,building,“whoever sprayed those slogans on my building can come back and clean them off themselves.
8117,building,"the people understand very well who provoked and backed the attackers.”  the defaced building walls remained as they were, the angry slogans bright red and glaring, for about three months."
8118,authorities,"“they delivered the body to the family two hours ago, and they’re saying it’s a suicide.”  the previous spring, the authorities had gone after omidreza mirsayafi, a young blogger from a working-class family who, like so many iranians, was finding it harder and harder to get by."
8119,war,mirsayafi was referring to the outpouring of support iran had extended to lebanon in the wake of the lebanese militant group hezbollah’s 2006 war with israel.
8120,war,"as hezbollah’s main supporter, tehran sent hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and helped rebuild hospitals and homes in beirut bombed during the war, bringing salaries and jobs to thousands of lebanese."
8121,sentenced,"the tone of the letter was polite, but it still provoked the anger of security officials, who filed a complaint against mirsayafi to the judiciary, which then tried him and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison."
8122,imprisonment,he was sentimental and posted pictures of roses and poets until his imprisonment in the spring of 2008.
8123,inside,"i’d rather not write at all if i have to stop being frank and honest in my words.”  in another post he wrote about an experience that he called his second “birth,” when something inside him compelled him to stop being a “passive bystander” in the face of committed wrongs."
8124,arrested,obviously he could not simply ignore the insult—yet if he did anything he was sure to get arrested.
8125,basij,"having witnessed the scene up close, and without any second thought, i ran at the basij [militia] boy and shoved him aside."
8126,police,"omid went on to recount the other paramilitaries descending upon him with batons, beating him to the ground and dragging him into a police van."
8127,tortured,"we know they tortured him, and we want to complain.”  “has there been an autopsy?” i asked."
8128,torture,"“if the forensic doctor had examined him, there would have been evidence of the torture.”  “the ones who washed his body before burial, they saw all the bruises."
8129,court,"i explained that such testimony wouldn’t hold in court, that sometimes bruising can come after death, depending on how the corpse is handled, and that only a formal autopsy could prove torture."
8130,conviction,"but an autopsy would have required the permission of a judge, which would certainly not have been granted; and even in many cases, i explained, where we had had forensic evidence of torture, we had been unable to secure a conviction."
8131,justice,"“in another world, justice will be served."
8132,power,"when justice is not available to us in this world, there is nothing for us to do but seek refuge in a higher power,” i said."
8133,justice,and then to trust that justice must be forfeited to god?
8134,imprisoned,"this was always the most painful part of my work: the searching eyes of the mothers and fathers whose children had been killed or were imprisoned, seeing in me some potential help."
8135,lawyer,"but the reality is that the fate of their sons and daughters rests largely on the political conditions of iran, not on my abilities as a lawyer."
8136,law,"my daughter nargess, now living in canada while studying for a master’s degree in law, was returning to tehran that evening to visit with us and finish up some loose ends with her law apprenticeship."
8137,inside,"i tried to chat naturally as we drove and went inside, but once i saw nargess’s face as she emerged from the arrivals hall, i knew something was wrong."
8138,taken,"“maman, they’ve taken my passport away,” she said."
8139,interrogation,"when had she become so unflappable, able to be breezy under interrogation with an intelligence agent who had just confiscated her passport?"
8140,wall,"as i stared at the old wooden clock on the wall, which i had bought on jordan street not long after our marriage, i couldn’t say what, exactly; i couldn’t follow the thought out to its logical progression."
8141,state,the state had finally started going after my family.
8142,imprisoned,"i had witnessed this over the years with many of my clients, dissidents and activists whose relatives suffered state intimidation, were hassled and threatened and sometimes blackmailed or imprisoned, all “collateral damage” in the quest to get the original target—the dissident or activist or journalist in question—to drop their activities."
8143,prisoner,"in one typical tactic, the spymasters would simply arrest the loved one of a political prisoner who was resisting the state’s demands to make a false confession and incriminate himself."
8144,prisoner,"they would then tell the prisoner that his sister or wife had been arrested, and that unless he confessed, they would be forced to torture her."
8145,lawyer,"i was just a lawyer, by dint of having my career as a judge suspended—a lawyer working to make the laws of the country more fair, trying to promote lawfulness."
8146,authorities,"to me this was as clear as the light of day, but for the authorities, growing more merciless by that same light, it seemed to make no difference."
8147,situation,"i really haven’t done anything wrong.”  —  in the days that followed, i sometimes overheard her on the phone with her friends, still laughing off her situation."
8148,burglar,"finally, i’m becoming important!”  as a precaution, javad insisted that we install a burglar alarm in our house."
8149,police,he chose a system that would automatically alert the local police station in case of a break-in.
8150,authorities,"i found this ridiculous, because if we ever faced attack it would be the authorities themselves who would be responsible."
8151,authorities,"several days passed, and the authorities summoned nargess for questioning on the very day i was due to travel abroad for a seminar."
8152,arrest,"would i board that plane and turn my back on my daughter, aware that so often when intelligence agents summon someone for “investigation,” it is an occasion to arrest them?"
8153,interrogation,"her father is here; they’ll be fine.” i said such things into the phone at every opportunity, several times a day, until the day of my departure and nargess’s interrogation."
8154,police,"ahmadinejad’s popularity had sunk abysmally; iranians widely reviled him for ruining the economy and for the repressiveness of his rule: the stepped-up censorship, the morality police, the conservative islamic agenda that seemed to slowly, with each passing month, find a new quarter of iranian public life in which to assert itself."
8155,term,both were determined to avoid competing directly with each other to prevent another ahmadinejad term at any cost.
8156,taken,"young people, especially, were so excited that they had taken to spending whole evenings and much of the night in the streets."
8157,where,"commissioned by an iranian shah to rival the champs-élysées, vali asr was the stretch of tehran where the children of the elite raced their ferraris, where porticoed boutiques sold velvet curtains from milan that cost more than a construction laborer made in a lifetime, where prostitutes loitered at rush hour, where taxi drivers and young men with long hair and grunge-rock t-shirts lined up to buy hot stew from curbside stands."
8158,freedom,"“i’m voting for freedom,” i said."
8159,freedom,"freedom is with karroubi,” another interrupted, holding his posters aloft."
8160,law,i unlocked the door to my law office and hurried to make tea ahead of my colleagues’ arrival.
8161,authorities,"i wondered, with the election taking place in the morning, whether the authorities would pay much attention to the report my colleagues and i would be releasing later in the week."
8162,arrested,"in the past, i’d had an assistant to help me with such tasks, but the authorities had recently arrested the last young woman who’d worked for me."
8163,authorities,i did not want the authorities to spy on our meeting.
8164,authorities,"since the authorities closed our office in december 2008, we were still holding our weekly meetings at my law office."
8165,state,"our caseload defending arrested activists and journalists had doubled in the past year, as the state intensified its crackdown on its critics."
8166,justice,"that evening we were meant to be working on a report about underage executions, one of the gravest flaws in the country’s justice system."
8167,repression,"if mahmoud ahmadinejad was elected for a second term, the country would slide even more deeply into repression."
8168,where,"it took us a couple of hours to finish, and we agreed to meet again the next week, upon my return from a short trip to majorca, where i was heading that evening to deliver a speech on freedom of expression."
8169,where,"with nargess, too.” this summer, our daughter would be coming home from the hague, where she was apprenticing after having finished her master’s in canada, and i was looking forward to the break."
8170,exercise,"he was perpetually worried about my health, chiding me to eat less rice and to get more exercise."
8171,case,"i picked up my bag and scanned the room, in case i was forgetting something."
8172,where,where had his supporters been during those final days?
8173,where,"i apologized to the group in the café and returned to my laptop at the hotel, where i spent the next several hours."
8174,charged,"the results had karroubi at only 300,000 votes, a number he charged was less than the total number in his political party and campaign headquarters."
8175,authorities,"on the night of june 13, around midnight, the authorities began arresting people, among them the most distinguished politicians of the land."
8176,arrested,"they even arrested dr. ebrahim yazdi, the leader of the freedom movement, who was seventy-eight years old and in the hospital, attached to ivs for cancer treatment."
8177,police,"that same night, close to three o’clock, a band of ahmadinejad’s supporters, accompanied by the police, attacked a university of tehran student dormitory."
8178,where,"they marched peacefully and largely in silence, holding up placards that read, “where is my vote?” and “our silence is loud with what we cannot say.” they carried a green banner hundreds of yards long, a sign of their support for mousavi, who himself came out to greet the crowds."
8179,authorities,"the immense crowds around the city were peaceful, but in two incidents authorities fired on protesters."
8180,authorities,"when the injured were taken to the hospital, the authorities showed up and carted them off to prison."
8181,arrested,"the ministry of culture and islamic guidance ordered all foreign journalists to leave iran; the authorities arrested a number of iranian journalists and sent messages to others, saying that snipers were waiting to open fire on them, should they leave their homes."
8182,arrested,"a few of my colleagues, i learned, had been arrested; others had received threats and had gone into hiding."
8183,state,"at some point, the state had slowed down the internet connection."
8184,arrest,"“they’ll arrest you at the airport,” javad said."
8185,imprisoned,i knew that it would be politically too costly for the state to keep a nobel laureate imprisoned for too long and i’d be released after a spell.
8186,case,"i sat on the bed, looking out at the sea, a pale blue-gray in the twilight, and thought of a case file i had studied all those years ago."
8187,state,"back in 1999, when i was representing the family of a dissident couple who had been murdered by rogue intelligence agents, i had come across the death squad’s assassination list in the state’s files."
8188,death,"the couple whose family i represented had been stabbed to death in their home in november 1998; in the three weeks following their death, three dissident writers turned up dead in the outskirts of tehran, all apparently strangled."
8189,state,"many felt there had to be a connection between these murders, but no one imagined it would be something as coldly systematic as a simple hit list, drawn up by state agents."
8190,killing,the ministry of intelligence had formally approved my killing.
8191,state,"the authorities had not been able to carry it out then, because the reformists began revealing the state’s involvement with the death squads."
8192,state,"but what about now, when the state was more shaken than at any moment in its history?"
8193,death,"on the one hand, i thought, if the islamic republic is praying for my death, why should i help it along?"
8194,where,"i packed my bag as if in a trance, unsure where it would end up."
8195,gate,"i stood by the departure gate, staring at the word “tehran” on the board."
8196,arrest,"i might have ended up under house arrest, like the green movement opposition leaders."
8197,freedom,"those early days of the demonstrations kept the world transfixed, and the images and scenes of a middle eastern nation rising up for freedom dominated the international news."
8198,state,"in those tense days of late june, the state sent its full armory of police officers, security agents, and paramilitaries into the streets."
8199,state,"they took his id card off him, to keep as evidence that he worked for the state."
8200,killing,"a passerby filmed the whole incident and posted it online; the killing of neda went viral, and her frozen face became iconic of the brutality of that time."
8201,arrested,"by this point, everyone knew that those who were injured and went to the hospital were often arrested by the police in the emergency room."
8202,execution,"they knew that the slightest hint of violence toward the state would lead the regime to respond furiously, going on a killing and execution spree, as it had done in the early days of the revolution when it had been challenged by people."
8203,state,"and so they stayed stubbornly in the streets, chanting, “we don’t want an islamic state!” and “death to the dictator!”  as tensions mounted and the depth of the challenge posed to the regime became more evident, many iranians began to complain that the united states was not doing enough to support the protesters."
8204,establishment,"it would have emboldened the establishment figures and led them to call the opposition american stooges, and it would have risked creating a rift between the opposition leaders and the iranian people."
8205,inside,"the president’s subtle yet pointed remarks, i felt, reflected a sophisticated understanding of the internal dynamic inside iran."
8206,authorities,soon the authorities began regularly summoning two of my colleagues for interrogations.
8207,detention,"—  many of the arrested protesters were taken to a makeshift detention center called kahrizak, which in the iranian imagination is now a name that haunts, like abu ghraib."
8208,prisoners,"it was a large prefabricated warehouse divided into many small rooms, and the authorities packed prisoners into these spaces, often denying them access to a toilet."
8209,torture,"torture, here, was systematic and brutal."
8210,prisoners,the guards sodomized male prisoners with bottles and batons and raped the women.
8211,detainees,"several detainees died under these circumstances, including the son of a high-ranking official who happened to be an ahmadinejad supporter."
8212,establishment,it was when this boy was killed that the political establishment started to pay attention.
8213,state,"when the victims had been only gheir-khodi, outsiders with no affiliation to the state, the regime had been unmoved."
8214,abuse,"as the reports emerged of the rapes and abuse at kahrizak, people came to understand exactly the price they would pay for challenging the regime."
8215,state,"to shout “god is great” from your rooftop in an islamic country should not, the thinking went, be a punishable offense; but in this collective action, in hearing the echoes reverberate across the streets and throughout neighborhoods, people signaled to one another, and to the state, that they had not forgotten."
8216,death,the slogan “death to the dictator” was etched in their hearts.
8217,term,"ahmadinejad, intoxicated with his victory, called his opponents khas o khashak, nothing but “dust and dirt.” in the short term, he could easily claim success; as president, he’d crushed the widest and most significant popular uprising iran had witnessed since the islamic revolution."
8218,power,"khamenei declared his unstinting support for ahmadinejad, and the revolutionary guards, who had handled the repression and bolstered the system, acquired even more power than before."
8219,state,"the foremost classical musician of iran, mohammad reza shajarian, sided openly with the “dust and dirt” and asked state television to stop airing his music; a musician of the younger generation wrote a song called “khas o khashak” that quickly went viral."
8220,court,one night he told me that a court summons had arrived for me.
8221,detention,"they want me to be quiet.”  between the interrogation and later detention of my colleagues and the scale and severity of the torture at kahrizak, i knew i could not return to iran anytime soon."
8222,war,"even during the iran-iraq war and during the days when tehran was under a barrage of missiles, i didn’t leave my country."
8223,sink,"nargess had decorated her small flat, which, in the dutch style, had a sink in the main room, with iranian kilims and tiles, but despite being surrounded by all these textiles and colors of home, i felt terribly dislocated."
8224,where,this was where i liked to sit when talking on the phone; i would watch the children kick balls about or ride their bikes while holding popsicles.
8225,authorities,"he had a special separate sim card exclusively for my calls, bought under someone else’s name, to make it difficult for the authorities to trace."
8226,where,“where have you been?
8227,where,"“are you crying?” my fingers unconsciously flew up to my throat, where the walnut bulge had finally subsided."
8228,situation,“go on.”  “she kept touching me…and i…i succumbed to the situation.
8229,officers,mahmudi called someone; he told some officers who were apparently waiting downstairs in the street to come up.
8230,arrested,“they only arrested me.
8231,arrest,"all i know is they didn’t arrest her.”  —  javad described how they took him straight to evin prison, where i had visited so many clients over the years and where i had been detained for twenty-five days."
8232,cell,"and then they led him to a solitary confinement cell, perhaps only slightly bigger than an ordinary bathtub, and left him there, with nothing to treat the bloody welts on his back."
8233,cell,"the cell was so small he could traverse the length in two strides, the carpet dirty and yellowed and smelling of dampness."
8234,confinement,"this is a little bit of meanness that i recalled from my own time in solitary confinement at evin, because the one blanket means you have the choice of either rolling it up as a pillow, and then sleeping in the cold, or using it to cover yourself, and developing neck and back pain from the lack of head support."
8235,cell,"for two full days, javad was left alone in his cell."
8236,cell,"the fluorescent lights in his cell and in the corridor were on around the clock, so he started losing his sense of night and day."
8237,cell,"on the third day, two prison guards came to his cell."
8238,guard,"they blindfolded him and pushed a stick into his hands; he held on to one end and a guard held the other, as they walked down the corridor, twisting and turning, up stairs and down."
8239,where,"finally they arrived at a room where they took his blindfold off, a sort of courtroom without windows."
8240,court,"a bearded cleric, the judge, sat behind a wooden desk, and next to him a court clerk."
8241,sentenced,"according to article 225 of the islamic penal code, you are sentenced to death by stoning."
8242,sentence,"the sentence will be carried out two days from now.”  “i want a lawyer,” javad said."
8243,lawyer,"“i’m not going to do anything without a lawyer.”  “a lawyer!” the judge said, amused."
8244,lawyer,what is a lawyer going to say?
8245,trial,at least your spirit won’t be wretched and tormented after you die.”  the whole trial took about twenty minutes.
8246,punishment,"iranian judges scarcely ever handed down stoning verdicts, but the situation seemed to require an especially horrific punishment."
8247,cell,"afterward, they blindfolded javad again and led him back to his cell with the stick."
8248,cell,"as he recounted the terror of being back in the cell, the numbness of not knowing when it was day and when it was night, the suffocating sense of quiet, the cement walls, the lack of anything to read or even look at, i felt a stab of grief."
8249,confinement,"those who have served time call solitary confinement “white torture,” and ordinary people like javad suffer the most, because they have not prepared themselves."
8250,ward,"they readied themselves beforehand, practicing mental tricks and ways of coping; they knew what to do to ward off the panic."
8251,cell,"the day, or some lengthy time that felt like a day, after the trial, mahmudi, the man who had devoted his life to destroying mine, came to javad’s cell."
8252,cell,"when mahmudi saw javad crumpled against the side of the cell, unshaven, his hair greasy, with dark circles under his eyes, his eyes lit up."
8253,cell,"“don’t you dare ever mention islam again, do you hear me?” he shoved him back against the cell wall and kicked him in the stomach."
8254,sharia,"you, who’ve violated sharia in the most disgusting way….you haven’t even prayed once since you’ve been here!"
8255,cell,"you dare question our islam?”  they had been filming him in his cell, javad realized."
8256,pleading,"now she’ll see what a big weakness she has.”  when javad saw that pleading or protesting would only provoke mahmudi to beat him more, he asked what it was they wanted from him."
8257,court,"if you do as i say, we’ll let you go.”  “but what about the court’s verdict?”  farahani barked a laugh."
8258,court,“my word has more authority around here than the court verdict.
8259,cell,"say it enough times that you can say it on camera tomorrow morning from memory.”  “rest up,” mahmudi said as they left the cell, clanging the metal door hard behind himself."
8260,state,"the paragraph read straight out of an islamic republic playbook—the language was the stuff of the kayhan newspaper or state tv, the regime’s two main propaganda outlets."
8261,guard,"at some hour before dawn, a prison guard arrived, and javad’s transformation began."
8262,guard,"a guard blindfolded him and led him through to another room, javad again negotiating a maze of corridors with the aid of a stick."
8263,cell,"once again, javad was blindfolded, handed the stick, and led back to his cell."
8264,cell,"a few minutes later, mahmudi’s boss came to his cell."
8265,freed,"you bring them here, and after that you’ll be freed."
8266,court,the court verdict is also easy.
8267,question,"you’ll bring that certificate here, ask for it to be included in your file, and tell the judge that the lady in question was married to you on a temporary basis."
8268,unlawful,that’ll take care of the unlawful sexual liaison.
8269,taken,"they had taken my judgeship, my entire life’s ambition; when i resurrected myself and built a human rights center, they took that, too; with their violence and electoral fraud, i had lost my homeland."
8270,sentence,"but javad was talking again, asking me—me!—for advice about his pending stoning sentence."
8271,guilt,"i felt as though i were in some sort of daze, bewildered and swinging between rage and a low-lying guilt."
8272,guilty,was i right to feel guilty?
8273,where,"that i knew of many cases where the intelligence ministry had done the same sorts of things to others, used sexual blackmail and traps of all sorts, in order to force dissident politicians out of public life or simply to wound and silence critics."
8274,law,"iranian law allows for two types of marriage, conventional and temporary."
8275,court,"javad had taken the certificate back to the court at evin, which, in turn, fined him 100,000 tomans, precisely the amount mahmudi’s boss had specified."
8276,punishment,"so now the punishment they had dangled over him, execution by stoning, the punishment they had used to force him to denounce me before the cameras, was null."
8277,pleading,"javad was broken, pleading during each conversation for me not to leave him."
8278,situation,"and she can’t do anything about the situation anyway, so i think we shouldn’t worry her.”  “i think she should know.”  “let’s see what happens, and whether they end up broadcasting your dad’s confession."
8279,power,the field of human rights is not about pretty words; it involves the abuse of the vulnerable by those who wield power.
8280,inside,"i told her that if she wanted to be a human rights lawyer and activist, she had to cultivate the culture of that world inside herself."
8281,torture,"your father couldn’t take that kind of torture.”  she crossed her arms over her chest tightly, and listened."
8282,law,"but she wanted to become an activist herself, to use her knowledge of the law to defend iranians."
8283,where,"often i ended up in geneva, where a number of united nations bodies that i dealt with were based."
8284,ordered,"i sat in a café and ordered an espresso, a short, bitter european preparation that i had grown to like."
8285,arrested,she had been arrested on the very first day of the protests.
8286,crime,"i gave her details about the numbers of arrests, the conditions of the detention centers, the harassment of activists, and the persecution of ordinary iranians whose only crime had been to show up at a few demonstrations."
8287,building,"as i left the building, i saw that a group of iranians were staging a protest rally outside."
8288,inside,"in the months that followed the events of june 2009, iranians across much of the world, from los angeles to prague, held such demonstrations in solidarity with the green movement protesters inside iran."
8289,where,"i thought of the courage it had taken for those young people in tehran to go out into the streets holding those simple placards—“where is my vote?”—with the openness and simplicity of a child, only to be razed down by bullets."
8290,state,"wherever i went i told my audience about what was happening in iran, and how state censorship meant that the world heard little, or not enough, about what iranians were going through."
8291,situation,that is our situation.
8292,taken,why ever not?” javad was taken aback.
8293,state,"the world press began covering the story around the clock, and newspapers ran caricatures of ahmadinejad embracing my medal, saying, “i finally got my wish, and a medal too!” “this is the first time a nobel peace prize has been confiscated by national authorities,” the norwegian foreign minister said, calling the state’s move shocking."
8294,court,"they stood by the vault while the poor bank manager, a kind man who knew us well and seemed to find all of this excruciating, examined a letter from the court allowing access to the box."
8295,where,“where’s the medal?
8296,state,"javad, now being paraded before the state’s cameras for the second time, took the medal out of the box and handed it to mahmudi, who held it up before the camera."
8297,ordered,"“now lock it up,” mahmudi ordered the bank manager."
8298,taken,"so your wife can stop spreading lies about this government, pretending we’ve taken away her prize.”  javad was furious."
8299,state,"how do my family documents, or my marriage certificate, have anything to do with state security?”  “i’m the one who makes that call.”  mahmudi and his crew turned and walked out, taking the second key with them."
8300,where,"the bank manager led him to his office, where he offered javad some sugar water."
8301,law,"don’t you see there’s no law, just bullying everywhere?"
8302,arrested,"we never spoke of my returning to tehran, as even despite the nobel prize, it was almost certain i would be immediately arrested."
8303,building,"for javad, the hounding and the harassment were just building, it seemed, after his terrible ordeal, instead of letting up."
8304,power,"in the islamic republic, everything could be forgiven in the name of safeguarding “security.” of course, “security” had now become a hollow word, just a euphemism for the system’s absolute political power and its crushing of all criticism."
8305,warrant,“do you have a warrant?” her husband asked.
8306,warrant,"“but the warrant doesn’t mention anyone’s name,” nooshin said, alarmed."
8307,arrest,"“exactly—that means we can arrest anyone, including you,” mahmudi said, grinning."
8308,interrogation,and then mahmudi told nooshin that she needed to come with him to the “ministry” for interrogation.
8309,building,what legitimate government building would be open at that hour?
8310,illegal,it’s illegal.
8311,court,"he roamed the city until nearly dawn, going from one police station to the next, rousing the on-duty clerk at the tehran magistrate’s court, but found no trace of the intelligence agents or his wife."
8312,charged,"when i heard what had happened, my anger surged, and i charged out of the apartment in london to go for a walk."
8313,cell,"i couldn’t sit still, knowing they had arrested the only sister i had left, the person i loved most dearly in the world after my husband and children; it tormented me to know that she was sitting in a cell in evin prison because of me."
8314,detention,"i made extra dua every single day of her detention, whispering at the end, “please, god, let them release my sister.” mahmudi didn’t beat her, but his agents verbally abused her for hours on end during interrogation."
8315,where,where does she get her money from?
8316,confinement,"it was strict solitary confinement for nooshin, as it had been for me."
8317,inside,"but i was familiar with mahmudi’s mind, his tactics; i had come to know them inside out."
8318,state,the intelligence apparatus of a state like the islamic republic knows no gray area.
8319,trial,"stop sending messages through me—it’s useless.”  for the next two years they kept her in limbo, not setting a trial date but preventing her from traveling abroad and calling her back in for more questioning."
8320,trial,"finally, after two years, her case went to trial."
8321,court,"mahmudi had told her that once the court was convened, she would probably get six months in prison."
8322,court,"the day of her trial, nooshin walked into the court building with her lawyer, her stomach gurgling with nerves."
8323,court,"do you have a court case, too?” nooshin asked, with some concern."
8324,court,“god forbid i’d have a court case!” the girl laughed.
8325,court,“i was visiting my father—he’s a judge at the revolutionary court.
8326,case,"i’m heading to class now.”  nooshin’s lawyer interrupted to ask what branch the girl’s father presided over, and it turned out to be the same as the one handling nooshin’s case."
8327,situation,they quickly briefed her about nooshin’s situation and asked her to put in a good word through her father.
8328,court,"nooshin walked out of the court that day acquitted, exonerated from “conspiracy against national security through cooperation with shirin ebadi” and removed from the list of those barred from leaving the country."
8329,term,"despite the two-year-long machinations of one of the country’s top spymasters, my sister evaded a prison term because she happened to teach dentistry and ran into one of her students in the courthouse lobby."
8330,power,"i believed they knew that i had no great sums of money hidden anywhere, that i did not receive sizable monthly transfers into my bank account from some shadowy foreign power."
8331,state,"state television and radio had carried little coverage of the nationwide protest movement, and what it did broadcast was highly partisan and distorted."
8332,state,iranians’ anger grew such that they began chanting against the state broadcaster on the streets during protests.
8333,authorities,"as the iranian authorities stepped up their scrambling efforts, not only did they knock bbc persian and voa persian off the air, but they also interfered with the signals of neighboring networks that also broadcast on hot bird."
8334,state,"the iranian government, for its part, was also a paying client of eutelsat, because a number of iranian state networks were also broadcast on hot bird; thus iran, as a customer of eutelsat, was well placed to ignore its warnings."
8335,state,"but for iranians, this was a disaster, because now the state could jam this other satellite without anyone else complaining."
8336,where,"imagine one of the very last closed societies on earth (apart from north korea and china, where people’s access to outside news and information is heavily restricted) suddenly losing its main connection to the world overnight."
8337,state,"by knocking the persian news networks off hot bird, eutelsat—a french company operating in the european union, which avowed such commitment to universal human rights—was essentially creating the perfect state of affairs for the authoritarian government of iran."
8338,where,"as i walked through the dorchester’s lobby, lined with palms and urns of roses and scented warm and sweet as a patisserie, i could not decide where to go next."
8339,state,"for years, in tehran, my ears had been primed for the sound of a motorbike; the state’s favorite mode of killing critics and dissidents was sending an assassin on a bike."
8340,building,"nargess and i had moved into an apartment building with a concierge and multiple gates, a place where one simply could not get through without codes and some level of permission."
8341,situation,he had always referred to me as a colleague—his organization had also won the nobel peace prize—and i felt he might understand the gravity of the situation with eutelsat.
8342,building,"we sat together in the vaulted interior of the ministry of foreign affairs building, and he listened patiently."
8343,case,"wherever i went, meeting with various officials, with desmond tutu, at the united nations, i brought up this issue, of iranians’ right to free access to information and the astonishing case of the european firm that had effectively capitulated to the iranian government."
8344,state,"this soon became a key issue of public debate and concern, the fact that the state was jeopardizing iranians’ health in order to censor what they could watch on television."
8345,inside,"this, too, proved that my work outside the country could still have a great impact on the government and what people inside the country were thinking and talking about."
8346,authorities,"i knew that the iranian authorities and mahmudi were pressuring javad intensely to disclose information about our life, and i worried that they would use whatever they might somehow glean against us."
8347,authorities,"he went to see the authorities to ask for it back, along with our property deeds and birth certificates."
8348,power,they wrote that i was refusing to allow javad to come to britain (as though this was in my power!)
8349,arrest,what if they arrest me after i’ve gone through?
8350,evin,"through interrogations and various channels, many politicians and civic and human rights activists had learned that they were on the second list; thus they stayed away from the airports, because to attempt to travel would lead to the confiscation of their passport and a trip to evin prison."
8351,arrested,"i’ve traveled on it many times.”  “well, if you travel on this, you’re going to get arrested.”  javad stood there in shock."
8352,arrested,"they were probably hoping you’d travel on it without noticing; they would let you through the airport there, and then at heathrow you’d have been arrested for traveling on a forged passport.”  he didn’t say anything, so i continued:  “that would have been ideal for them."
8353,arrested,they let you get arrested by the british border police.
8354,arrested,"then they haven’t done anything to you themselves, but both of us look terrible when the news gets out that you were arrested in london for traveling into the u.k. on forged documents.”  “i don’t think you’re right,” javad said."
8355,police,"and mahmudi probably didn’t think you’d go to the passport office, so it didn’t occur to him to keep the passport police in the loop.”  “maybe you’re right."
8356,pen,"this time, javad channeled his fury through his pen."
8357,building,"he asked, “can you please explain to me what damage i, a seventy-year-old engineer who has spent my entire lifetime building my country, can pose to national security through a short trip to visit my family?”  a week later, mahmudi summoned him."
8358,taken,"no foreign travel.”  javad rose and walked out of the room, saying goodbye only to preempt mahmudi’s rage at not being taken leave from properly."
8359,building,"the drive home took him longer than usual; the streets were clogged with traffic, hulking cement mixers heading toward their construction projects, reminding javad of the building projects he used to oversee, the status and respect he’d once enjoyed as a senior engineer of the teeming capital."
8360,interrogation,"from that day on, mahmudi summoned javad twice a month for interrogation, each time posing the same questions, again and again: where does she go?"
8361,where,"and always, always: where does she get her money?"
8362,inside,"as i traversed the capitals of europe, working to ensure that iranians inside the country had access to unbiased news, the siege against me continued in tehran."
8363,state,"one day, javad told me that a letter had arrived from the state tax organization."
8364,law,"i had settled my taxes each year, and i had received my annual license to practice law on that basis."
8365,law,"iranian law exempts income from awards and prizes from taxation, so there was no basis to tax the nobel money."
8366,case,"a friend and colleague of mine at the defenders of human rights center, nasrin sotoudeh, took up the case on my behalf and went to file an objection."
8367,charges,"one visit to the tax office was enough to make clear who had concocted the charges; the tax officials told her that the herasat, or safeguarding, section was very sensitive about the case."
8368,term,herasat is the term for the section of each ministry or organization across the government through which the ministry of intelligence exercises its influence.
8369,case,"in other words, this case had been put together against me through orders from the intelligence ministry."
8370,case,"they sparred, and she refused to back down, promising to take the case to the board of settlement of tax disputes."
8371,case,nasrin discovered a litany of problems and discrepancies in the case against me.
8372,building,"they had backdated a tax warning to 2004 but had sloppily included the address from my building that had come into existence only after 2008, when the street had been renumbered."
8373,case,"when the case reached the board of settlement of tax disputes, the tax officials argued that the nobel prize is a “political” award and, as such, is taxable."
8374,guilty,"that should have settled the matter, but the board had decided—or been instructed in advance—that i was guilty."
8375,sentenced,"for agreeing to defend me, and for her other human rights work, she was sentenced to six years in prison."
8376,arrest,"though i tried to raise her case with the media and mention her during my talks and meetings, her arrest attracted only modest attention in the west."
8377,state,i wished that the international media paid more attention to how iranians in the younger generation were being systematically bullied by the state into abandoning their work.
8378,sentence,"the climate in which i had built up my practice and established myself no longer existed, and by meting out such a harsh sentence to nasrin, the state was trying to intimidate the few remaining human rights lawyers who had not already gone abroad."
8379,court,"the court also barred nasrin from practicing law or leaving the country for twenty years and found her guilty of “acting against national security” and of “propaganda against the regime.” apart from her recent work defending my seized assets, the main focus of nasrin’s work had been to defend iran’s most vulnerable citizens, prisoners of conscience and minors facing the death penalty."
8380,law,"i had known nasrin for almost twenty years, since before she had even finished her law degree."
8381,police,uniformed police stormed in and began arresting the women present.
8382,officers,one of the officers told nasrin that they would not detain her and instructed her to go home.
8383,court,"“my friends who you’re taking away are my clients, and they’re going to need me.” she spent that night in a cold cell at the police station with her friends, who became instant clients, and defended them the next morning in court."
8384,arrested,"she represented arash rahmanipour, a young man who was arrested and later hanged for his alleged involvement in the green movement uprising."
8385,authorities,nasrin discovered and made known that rahmanipour had confessed only after iranian authorities threatened his family.
8386,arrest,word reached me after her arrest that officials had promised to release her swiftly if she confessed to her alleged crimes and spoke out against me and other colleagues.
8387,prosecution,"in the end, she refused to capitulate, even though one of the intelligence agents told her, “i’ll make sure that you stay in prison for over ten years, and that by the time you’re released your three-year-old son will have grown into a man taller than you.”  they refused to allow her to visit with her children and began summoning her husband for interrogation, threatening him with prosecution as well."
8388,inside,"but she stood firm, and i worried for her, because she was inside the country, firmly within their grasp."
8389,state,"the state viewed them as guilty in their own right, for their own human rights work and the defense of their clients, but their ultimate guilt came from their association with me."
8390,sentenced,"unable to snare me, the authorities had systematically tracked down and sentenced virtually every significant colleague i had worked with over the past decade."
8391,case,"with nasrin in prison, there was no one to defend my tax case."
8392,court,"no one was prepared to represent me, and even if we were to find someone, the court would not listen, anyway."
8393,conviction,my conviction would be reaffirmed at every stage.
8394,state,"when the board of settlement of tax disputes finally issued its verdict, the state moved to dispossess me with an astonishing swiftness, perhaps the single most efficient action committed by the islamic republic in the name of tax compliance."
8395,possession,"they put all my properties up for sale within days, aided by already having the deeds in their possession."
8396,freed,"it struck me that back in august, when they’d freed javad and asked him for the deeds, this plan had already been under way; they had known what would unfold, and had readied themselves."
8397,authorities,the authorities estimated the value of what i owned at laughably low prices—just a fraction of their actual value.
8398,stretch,"when javad and i bought the land, before the revolution, it was just an arid stretch on the outskirts of tehran, the dirt rubbly and bare."
8399,wall,"i could tell you how many feet separated the row of apricots from the pomegranates, and where near the southern edge the ground slopes down toward a brick wall."
8400,where,"i can feel the smoothness of the wooden bench we bought the year negar was born, and the spot on the back where the girls carved their initials into it, near a knot in the wood."
8401,where,"my children grew up in that orchard, it was where the family always gathered, and as tehran became increasingly polluted and chaotic, it became the place i sometimes drove to just to breathe deeply."
8402,power,"of the main bank account i held in my name, i managed to withdraw $50,000 through a third party who had power of attorney."
8403,state,"once they sold everything off and seized all my accounts, it became clear that the wholesale financial dispossession at the hands of the state still had not generated enough money to pay my debts."
8404,charges,"in addition to the standing charges against me for conspiring against national security, i also became a formal debtor to the islamic republic and, in absentia, was barred from leaving the country."
8405,taken,"this means that if i ever go back, my passport will be taken at the airport and i will not be permitted to exit again."
8406,justice,"in the space of just one year, the country whose justice system i had once represented at the highest level determined that i must be a penniless traitor."
8407,building,"—  it began to rain softly as i reached my apartment building, pulling my grocery bags with me into the elevator."
8408,arrest,"instead, the glowing screen showed a message from javad:  mahmudi has told me that if i don’t pass along this message to you, he’ll arrest me again."
8409,question,"but if they want to speak to me, they have to prepare themselves to answer one question first: what law gives them the right to videotape someone’s bed?"
8410,arrest,"the culmination of javad’s arrest and everything they did to him, my sister’s arrest, and then our final dispossession—all of this hurt me in ways i felt every day."
8411,authorities,"what the authorities in iran had done to javad, to our marriage, was something that could never be put right."
8412,war,"i mean purity not in a moral sense but in terms of our ownership over our own story, our own history; our marriage was what we had built, a strong, loving bond forged over years of accommodation, a bond that had survived a revolution, a war, the loss of my career as a judge, the later regeneration of my professional life as a lawyer."
8413,question,"that partnership was forever gone, and the question of what we might create in its place loomed."
8414,authorities,"javad still pursued his passport application through the various authorities, but so far he had met with little success."
8415,state,"in june, iranian state television broadcast it on the prime-time flagship news program, 20:30, named for the hour of the evening when most iranians gathered around their televisions."
8416,authorities,"the authorities wanted to reach the widest possible audience in order to tell them, look and see for yourself who your heroes really are; see how the west is interfering in our country’s affairs."
8417,authorities,the authorities didn’t air it as a straight confession; that would have been too ham-handed.
8418,inside,"the loss of my judgeship, he said, using crude terms he would never have uttered, “was such a blow that it gave her a complex against the islamic republic.”  anyone who knew javad could feel him trembling inside, could see the tension in his frame and the way his hands fluttered awkwardly as he spoke."
8419,case,"so she could work against the islamic republic.”  the nobel prize, the voiceover noted, “has also been awarded to shimon peres and a number of other zionists.” and they made javad say that i had taken on the baha’is’ case through some shady collaboration; i would defend the accused baha’i leaders, and the community would try to make me “more famous internationally.”  but the lowest point was when the presenter dropped his dripping tone of faux objectivity and turned openly tabloid."
8420,where,or where else was it meant to be?
8421,case,"just in case anyone missed the segment, they aired it again a few days later."
8422,prisoners,"the state television station had broadcast a number of forced confessions that same month, by other political prisoners."
8423,killing,"unlike mubarak, gadhafi held out stubbornly to the end, launching a killing campaign to crush those who opposed him."
8424,state,"although iran’s movement fizzled, crushed by the state and the chaotic, conflicting demands of its supporters, the first crackle, the first spark, had been iranian."
8425,situation,"for the regime, it was a sticky situation to handle; on the one hand, the islamic republic had supported the arab uprising in the name of “islamic awakening,” but on the other, they well knew that if iranians were permitted to express their own solidarity and discontent, the implications for the regime could be dangerous."
8426,authorities,"the opposition leaders who had led the green movement, mehdi karroubi and mir hossein mousavi, called for demonstrations, and even though the authorities refused to grant permission, iranians came out into the streets anyway."
8427,arrested,"many were wounded, some were arrested, and some were killed."
8428,police,"six days later, people went back into the streets, and they were again crushed by the police."
8429,killing,"in shiraz, security forces threw a university student off a bridge, killing him instantly."
8430,arrested,"scores were arrested there, too."
8431,police,"as students kept their protests going across the nation’s universities, classes were canceled and the police stepped up their arrests."
8432,detention,those activists already in detention faced more severe restrictions and deteriorated conditions.
8433,police,police in black riot gear lined key squares and public parks; police convoys hulked up and down the expressways.
8434,state,the state was taking no chances; it would not permit iranians to seek the same freedoms the tunisians and egyptians had rallied for.
8435,arrest,"the authorities moved to arrest mousavi and karroubi, the opposition leaders, tacitly admitting that the state was fearful enough about the prospect of a challenge that it had to arrest the key candidates in the most recent national election."
8436,ordered,"no institution admitted responsibility for the arrests, but in interviews some revolutionary guards commanders and the intelligence minister suggested that the supreme leader had ordered everything personally."
8437,authorities,the authorities refused them regular visitation rights with family and kept them in secret apartments in undisclosed locations; they denied them access to the outdoors and adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables in their meals.
8438,officers,"soon both fell ill, but even in the hospital, security officers lingered in their rooms day and night."
8439,detention,"at first, both men’s wives stayed with them in detention, but after a few months, the authorities released karroubi’s wife."
8440,dictatorship,"people’s memories are very short, for anyone who knew the middle east even a little would understand that a dictator’s departure does not necessarily mean the end of dictatorship."
8441,power,"but i found the rise of the islamists, who so promptly emerged from the shadows to seek power, deeply disturbing."
8442,sharia,"the first thing they did after victory was to dampen their nations’ feminist movements, through the approval of new laws justified in the name of sharia."
8443,freedom,"these laws intensified the gender discrimination that already existed, and they also limited freedom of expression, so that the citizens would not dare express their dissatisfaction with them."
8444,where,"the salafists, as the extreme islamists in the arab world are known, took issue with a scene in the novel where satrapi portrays god as appearing in human form."
8445,power,"but perhaps more important, the film carried a powerful message about the vulnerabilities of a secularist in the midst of an increasingly conservative revolution, and how quickly islamists in power were able to close up the space in which more liberal or secular middle easterners used to exist."
8446,authorities,the authorities prosecuted the television station’s owner.
8447,power,"in egypt, too, the presidential elections brought into office an islamist whose strict, power-grabbing agenda soon caused great alarm."
8448,rape,"they rejected a u.n. declaration condemning violence against women and explicitly said that wives should not be permitted to file complaints against their husbands for rape, adding that a husband should have “guardianship” over his wife."
8449,power,"these moves, especially the draft constitution, so infuriated egyptians that they once again poured into tahrir square in protest, leading to days of unrest and mass demonstrations that culminated in clashes and, ultimately, the egyptian military’s removal of morsi from power."
8450,state,"what should a society do when a leader that is elected through a democratic process then seeks to subvert the very legal foundation on which the state, constitution, and electorate that voted him into power is based on?"
8451,power,can you allow a democratically elected leader to essentially destroy and subvert the principles that put him in power in the first place?
8452,freedom,"i walked in the streets and chanted for freedom and helped a revolt that was seized by islamists, leading to the collapse of my career, the collapse of the rights of women entirely.” what a bitter, startling time it was for me, to watch all this unfolding in the region, and to hear the indignation of western liberals, who felt it was “undemocratic” for egyptians to stop morsi and the muslim brotherhood from taking over egypt."
8453,imprisonment,"with the imprisonment of the key opposition leaders mousavi and karroubi, the majority of iranians who had held out hope that eventually, with time, the system would reform itself from within lost hope."
8454,state,"washington had long designated the mko as a terrorist group, but in september 2012 the group won; the state department took it off its list of designated terrorist organizations."
8455,war,"iranians across the world viewed the group with disdain—if there was anything that iranians of various political stripes agreed on, it was this, for the members of the mko had joined saddam hussein’s forces during the iran-iraq war, fighting against their own countrymen."
8456,situation,"but at a time when the political situation in iran looked terribly bleak and iranians increasingly felt that the supreme leader was not willing to retreat at all, reza pahlavi seemed to be a figure that a measure of hope and support could coalesce around."
8457,building,"—  in april 2011, the husband of one of my closest friends, mehrangiz kar, jumped off his tehran apartment building."
8458,law,"like me, mehrangiz was a lawyer, and she had dedicated the years after the iranian revolution to writing about the law, about legal discrimination."
8459,evin,"we were family friends—i had watched her daughters grow up alongside my own—and, like me, mehrangiz had spent time in evin prison."
8460,crime,"her crime had been attending a conference in berlin during the presidency of mohammad khatami, and for this she served fifty days."
8461,arrested,"she traveled abroad for treatment, and while she was outside iran, the authorities arrested her husband, siamak pourzand; they had previously arrested him on various occasions and forced him to confess on television to things he did not believe and crimes he had not committed."
8462,freedom,"and as with javad, the confession did not ultimately secure him freedom from torment."
8463,sentence,"because siamak fell ill in prison, the authorities eventually agreed that he could serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest."
8464,building,"he grew increasingly depressed, until one night he threw himself off his apartment building; he died instantly."
8465,death,"the night after his death, i watched his daughter leily, whom i had known when she was a little girl in ponytails, speak about her father on television."
8466,injustice,"“my father courageously chose death, a kind of death that would expose the injustice that was inflicted on him,” she said."
8467,court,"at the passport office, javad had received a reference number with which to follow up his case, and the trail led to the court that was imposing a ban on his freedom of movement."
8468,case,"there, he learned that his name was included in the case that had been brought against me for “conspiring against national security.”  “i’m listed as your ‘collaborator,’ ” he told me on the phone one night."
8469,interrogation,"he still saw mahmudi regularly for his monthly or twice-monthly interrogation sessions, and recently mahmudi had taken to standing him up."
8470,interrogation,—  mahmudi slammed the door of the interrogation room so hard the tea on his desk sloshed in its cup.
8471,pen,"“so here we are,” mahmudi said, tapping a pen against the files."
8472,question,"“back to the same question.”  javad waited, folding his hands in his lap."
8473,pen,"mahmudi held the pen up to the light, examining it."
8474,pen,and you also have to carry this pen with you at all times.
8475,where,"it’s a fountain pen with a built-in gps, so we’ll be able to monitor you at all times and know where you’re going.”  he again held up the pen, the same one he had been playing with since he’d walked into the room, and twirled it in his fingers."
8476,pen,"but once javad got home, he rang his friend and asked if his brother in the intelligence ministry could mediate with mahmudi to have the tracking pen demand withdrawn."
8477,prisoners,"if you helped get ten prisoners released, twenty more immediately took their place."
8478,freedom,have you brought freedom to iran?”  my whole body froze up as he spoke.
8479,guilt,that day a well of guilt sprang up inside me that i immediately understood i would carry forever.
8480,guilt,until that day i had never done anything that had made me feel guilt.
8481,building,"when the mob came to attack our building, he was the one who went downstairs and stood up to the rioters and challenged the police to protect us."
8482,guilt,"it had always been clear that the guilt and blame lay with the government, and that i wasn’t the one hurting us."
8483,authorities,"i was deeply wounded, but i knew that if we stayed together the authorities would persecute javad forever."
8484,crimes,"when i helped found this center, i wanted to focus its work tightly on iran and the right to legally defend those accused of crimes of conscience."
8485,prisoners,the iranian lawyers who worked so tirelessly to represent political prisoners were extraordinarily vulnerable.
8486,imprisoned,"the authorities monitored them closely, imprisoned scores of them, and intimidated their relatives."
8487,inside,"in time, working with a number of lawyers who had left iran in the aftermath of the 2009 protests, we created a vibrant network connecting lawyers inside and outside the country; we collaborated when possible on human rights cases, training workshops, and publishing legal articles."
8488,inside,this sort of connectivity was uplifting and motivating for both the lawyers forced into exile and the lawyers working away inside iran.
8489,court,"i told him that i, too, agreed, and we decided that i should give him power of attorney to go to court and pursue the legal formalities for a divorce."
8490,law,"of course, under iranian law he didn’t need my agreement to divorce me, but my formal authorization would make things much easier."
8491,where,"—  part of being an exile, a nomad, is that the most significant moments in your life pass by in places where you have no memories and no past."
8492,penalty,"on a warm, summery day, i was in madrid to speak at the fifth world congress against the death penalty."
8493,building,"but my thoughts were trained on what i was about to do as i entered the iranian embassy, which was housed in a hacienda-style building of white stucco and brick."
8494,power,"i passed through the lacy black lattice gates, carrying the certified power-of-attorney letter i had written, authorizing divorce proceedings."
8495,state,"then i gave a talk about the death penalty, during which i explained how in authoritarian countries the practice is exploited by the state to execute activists and, often, minors."
8496,taken,"four years earlier, just as today, my destiny had taken a sharp turn."
8497,power,"this is why i intensified my work in the newly formed cshr, to make sure that every single day i remembered that i had been born in a country where a mere intelligence agent had the power to crush a person’s life."
8498,situation,i went to see an iranian cleric in london—most of the shia clerics in london are iranian—and explained the situation.
8499,law,"iranian law doesn’t allow that,” he said imperiously, drawing his robes together."
8500,sharia,"this is just for us.”  after the revolution, iranian family law became based on sharia, and the judiciary decreed that when a woman is getting married for the first time, she requires the permission of her father."
8501,court,"if the father is not present or does not agree, the woman is obliged to go to court and request special permission to marry."
8502,law,"this medieval law applies only to women, of course, and it creates ridiculous amounts of trouble in iran."
8503,where,“where in islam is it written that this is required?” i asked the cleric.
8504,law,"her plan in life had been to become a lawyer, and through great effort she had studied the law in iran, passed her initial exam, and completed her internship."
8505,law,"i felt that my work, and the harassment it prompted from the intelligence ministry, had destroyed nargess’s chances of practicing law in iran."
8506,inside,"she said she could make more of a difference working outside iran, raising awareness of all the rights violations inside the country."
8507,question,"whenever i felt sad, a philosophical question always came to my mind: “is god happy to be alone?”      one autumn day during his second term, president mahmoud ahmadinejad traveled to the village of bint jbeil, in southern lebanon, and waved an iranian flag just a few miles away from the border with israel."
8508,where,he addressed a thronging crowd in the same stadium where hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah gave his victory speech to mark israel’s withdrawal from occupied southern lebanon in 2000.
8509,war,"the israeli-lebanon war of 2006, often called the hezbollah war, resulted in the leveling of nearly 90 percent of the buildings in bint jbeil."
8510,state,"photos of the ayatollah khomeini covered the stadium walls, alongside images of hezbollah heroes, and the flags of the islamic republic, hezbollah, and the lebanese state fluttered together."
8511,state,"for iran, lebanon, hezbollah, and the gateway through which it funnels all its money, arms, and military support—the neighboring state of syria—are no small investment."
8512,war,"by now, we are used to images of the syrian civil war, one of the greatest humanitarian tragedies of our young century."
8513,war,"but before syria’s conflict became a civil war, it was a broad-based uprising against the tyranny of assad."
8514,war,"it was assad, with the support of his iranian backers, who turned an essentially democratic revolt into a sectarian war."
8515,inside,"through the bloodbath that unfolded in syria, the islamic republic conveyed a clear warning to iranians, both those inside the country and the opposition movement abroad."
8516,power,"we will be assad, who would rather torch his country to the ground than relinquish power."
8517,case,"but the syrian case unfolded during a specific and uncertain time for iran, directly between the 2009 uprising and the 2013 presidential election, a time when iranians were weighing the prospect of change, observing the hopeful changes in other parts of the region, and considering how their own regime might be transformed."
8518,state,"in the run-up to the 2013 vote, the iranian regime was careful to avoid the mistake of 2009, and the state vetting body approved only candidates who would be unconditionally and unquestionably obedient to the supreme leader."
8519,war,"the vetting was tough enough that akbar hashemi rafsanjani, the old stalwart of islamic republic politics, who had led iran through two terms as president after the end of the war with iraq, was disqualified as a candidate."
8520,power,it was a vote that more than anything underscored the now explicit and all-encompassing power of the supreme leader.
8521,establishment,"one prerequisite for running seemed to be speaking out on record against the 2009 fitna, or conspiracy, as the hard-line establishment had termed the green movement uprising."
8522,arrest,"the reformists at first considered making their election participation contingent on mousavi and karroubi’s release from house arrest, though later they shifted course and agreed to field a candidate."
8523,freedom,"they did this as an act of faith, hoping that the system would not tamper with their votes, as it did in 2009, and would allow them the freedom to choose their elected leader, as the islamic republic’s constitution, for all its flaws, provides for."
8524,establishment,"the favored candidate of the establishment was a dour old negotiator, saeed jalili, but in the days before the election, an outpouring of frustration and discontent broke out around the status quo ahmadinejad had created."
8525,war,"it was finally clear and exposed on national television, and upheld by senior regime figures, that ahmadinejad had steered iran to the brink of war and economic collapse."
8526,situation,"the situation was so bad that iran, once a wealthy country, owed money to the world bank, and its inflation rate hovered around 50 percent."
8527,authorities,"the day the authorities announced the results, iranians celebrated in the streets, pouring into parks on foot and cruising in automobiles up and down tehran’s major boulevards, honking their horns."
8528,state,"through the brutal crackdown in 2009, iranians’ aspirations for democratic change had been crushed, and in their place the people had acquiesced to the state’s rigid, controlled handover of the presidency to one of the few men it had deemed sufficiently loyal."
8529,prisoners,"his choice for justice minister was one of the clerics accused of directly overseeing the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988, in which an estimated forty-five hundred citizens were killed."
8530,death,"when i had represented the family of dariush and parvaneh forouhar, dissident intellectuals who’d been stabbed to death in their home in 1998, the cleric’s name had come up repeatedly, invoked by the agents accused of carrying out the killings."
8531,term,"the ex-president, who’d had some serious disagreements with the supreme leader during his second term in office, once again became the focus of attention after declaring his support for the leader."
8532,charged,"that same summer of rouhani’s election, the supreme leader appointed ahmadinejad to the powerful expediency council, which is charged with mediating disputes between the parliament and the guardian council."
8533,state,"ahmadinejad’s “invaluable efforts” during his time as president, the supreme leader said, had earned him a place at the helm of one of the state’s most influential bodies."
8534,authorities,"it was an early signal that while ahmadinejad had been shifted out of the limelight, his radical positions were still shared by the highest authorities."
8535,incarcerated,"in the meantime, mousavi and karroubi were still under house arrest, and hundreds of others who had ended up incarcerated because of the 2009 presidential elections were still languishing in prisons."
8536,state,"the iranian state, as ever, is extremely adept at hiding the costs of its various policies from its citizens."
8537,war,"and, more recently, there is the suppurating civil war in syria, a conflict that has made four million syrians refugees."
8538,killing,but what about the massacre of muslims of chechnya or the ruthless killing of the uighur muslims in china?
8539,power,"the islamic republic’s foreign policy and modus operandi in the world are largely based on negative influence: the arming of proxies, the nurturing of militias, and investment in shia soft power; it will take a wholesale realignment of the regime’s perception of its interests to change this."
8540,state,"in the long term, a state that brokers its power in the shadows cannot be on sound enough terms with the world to provide security for its citizens."
8541,where,"indeed, saudi arabia’s rivalry with iran is slowly eroding the region from within, with proxy conflicts emerging in iraq and syria, and a dangerous sectarian strife is stoking instability and religious hatred where even just five years ago there had been peace and coexistence."
8542,inside,"since 2009, violations of human rights in iran have intensified markedly, and the united nations has designated a “special rapporteur” for iran, whose reports detail the gravity of what is happening inside the country."
8543,where,"so despite having a pragmatist in office once again, iran remains a country where a man can marry up to four wives, where women face enormous challenges securing a divorce, and where a married woman cannot travel without the written permission of her husband."
8544,authorities,what he has a better chance of success with is tackling the human rights violations that are not legally based but arise from the repressive ways the authorities treat iranian citizens.
8545,detention,"here i mean the late-night raids on the homes of critics, the unofficial detention centers run by the revolutionary guards, and the use of torture to extract confessions."
8546,abuse,"should rouhani decide to act resolutely, he might be able to intervene and slow down such systematic abuse."
8547,imprisoned,"and in the meanwhile, years and years have passed; countless iranians have been executed, imprisoned, and tortured; and thousands of journalists, academics, and activists have been cast into permanent exile."
8548,state,"either iran is led by politicians and reformers who will begin the painful, onerous task of fixing the country from within, brick by brick, law by law, or we will continue to stumble along, the economy deteriorating by the day, the middle class zoning out on turkish soap operas, while iran’s enormous potential as a regional superpower is frittered away, until it is a second-class state that is shunned by the world and viewed by its neighbors as a pestilence."
8549,power,"for much of the 2000s, i believed staunchly that international law gave iran a legitimate right to nuclear power and that the government—despite being undemocratic and extremist in most of its policies—was correct in demanding this right from the international community."
8550,inside,"most of the iranians i knew, especially those living inside the country and enduring the economic deterioration and privation that resulted from the western sanctions, had once felt the same way."
8551,power,"she had visited iran in the past, and she made some compelling and incisive points about the environmental dangers of nuclear energy and how urgent it was for countries to seek out and pursue renewable energy sources that would not pose the sorts of grave risks to their population that nuclear power does."
8552,where,i invited her to spend some time with me and my colleagues and organized a workshop where she could meet with a number of iranian human rights and civil-society activists.
8553,power,"she brought along some of her colleagues, several of whom were nuclear physicists, and they demystified a number of the arguments the islamic republic had upheld to justify why it was pursuing nuclear power so doggedly."
8554,power,"we learned that nuclear power was wholly unrelated to the research involved in radiation therapy for cancer, for example, and also about the dangers of toxic waste from nuclear enrichment."
8555,power,"after meeting with rebecca and her colleagues and devoting those hours to understanding a subject that was fairly specialized, i came to entirely change my views on nuclear power and iran’s pursuit of its right to a nuclear program."
8556,power,"i came to see that nuclear power, even when used for peaceful purposes, is rife with dangers."
8557,power,germany has reversed its course and will be shutting down all its nuclear power plants by 2022.
8558,building,the united states has refrained from building any new ones.
8559,state,"the catastrophe at the japanese fukushima plant in 2011 only underscored how perilous nuclear power can be, even when overseen by a diligent and responsible state—which, alas, iran is not."
8560,power,"if the islamic republic is determined to have nuclear power so it can build a bomb, that is reckless and pathological."
8561,power,"with all of this taken together, it’s clear that iran is not a country that needs to or should gamble with its citizens’ lives by pursuing nuclear power."
8562,question,it was after this shift in my views that i started a campaign aimed at bringing the question of nuclear energy to the center of public debate inside iran.
8563,inside,"the campaign slowly gained traction, and with time, people inside iran found the courage to speak up and carve out a space in which to discuss what was best for the country."
8564,war,they said publicly that the nuclear program had inflicted a greater blow to iran than eight years of devastating war with iraq.
8565,inside,"iranian women pursuing higher education inside the country had suffered acutely under ahmadinejad, who had instituted gender quotas across numerous disciplines, effectively making it impossible for women to study physics, chemistry, and tens of other subjects at numerous universities."
8566,inside,"i sent maryam a public message of congratulations, to recognize her incredible accomplishment and to remind all those iranian women inside the country that striving for an education was still worth it."
8567,imprisoned,"omid kokabee, a young iranian experimental laser physicist, had been arrested and imprisoned in 2011."
8568,sentenced,"before his arrest, kokabee had been a postdoctoral researcher at the university of texas; he had returned to iran to visit his family, whereupon the authorities had sentenced him to ten years in prison for allegedly “cooperating with enemy states.” in a 2013 letter written from evin prison, however, kokabee said that his arrest had followed his refusal to cooperate with the authorities on a military research project."
8569,state,"abroad they could pursue research work at the world’s most prestigious and academically advanced institutions, without fear of butting up against a security state that viewed researchers and scientists with either suspicion or designs of recruitment."
8570,inside,"inside iran, the climate for women, especially, was deteriorating by the day, despite rouhani’s election."
8571,police,"in september 2014, tehran’s chief of police for public places announced that women would no longer be permitted to work in the city’s cafés and restaurants, pushing thousands of women, especially university students, out of work."
8572,authorities,"and particularly disappointing for young people, the authorities in the capital even forbade women to watch that year’s soccer world cup, as had long been the custom, in public cinemas and cafés."
8573,state,"the moves were all part of a stealthy segregation plan, deployed piecemeal over time in and across different spheres, that threatened to remake public life in iran and push women, who participated vibrantly despite the state’s myriad restrictions, to the margins."
8574,state,"he had also singlehandedly snuffed out its women’s movement and, most dangerously, had renormalized the idea that women should be open targets for the state and ordinary iranians alike."
8575,arrest,"despite the panic spreading among the women of isfahan as the number of assaults rose to at least fifteen, the police failed to find and arrest the attackers."
8576,law,hard-liners in parliament were trying to push through a bill that would have protected vigilantes seeking to “enforce” islamic law.
8577,power,"and like all dictators, they are clinging to power with vicious violence."
8578,state,"in december 2014, my colleague narges mohammadi (who had served several terms in prison for clashes with the state) flew to the eastern border city of zahedan to bestow a prize from the defenders of human rights center on molavi abdul-hamid, the sunni friday prayer leader of the region."
8579,state,"they are made to feel like second-class iranians and are never able to secure senior positions in government, the military, or any state-affiliated institution."
8580,building,"in tehran, a city of nearly eight million people, the authorities have not permitted the building of any new sunni mosques."
8581,state,"with the sectarian tensions in the region rising every day, it is more imperative than ever for the iranian state to embrace its sunnis, so that iran remains invulnerable to the kind of sect-based violence and insecurity that is ravaging iraq and syria and threatens other parts of the persian gulf."
8582,state,"molavi abdul-hamid is a wonderful potential ally in this effort, if only the state would appreciate him."
8583,imprisoned,"the authorities have imprisoned his sons, killed some of his relatives, and banned him from traveling."
8584,authorities,"the day after narges traveled to zahedan to give abdul-hamid the prize, she was summoned for interrogation by the intelligence authorities."
8585,illegal,“is it illegal to give someone a prize?” narges asked them.
8586,state,"“and at a time of such tensions, is it such a bad thing to bring people closer together?”  it was astonishing that with so much sectarian instability in the region, the iranian state was not doing more to include its sunni citizens and project itself in the region as an islamic power that had the loyalty of both shia and sunni iranians."
8587,building,"the office i had rented in london as the base for my human rights ngo, the centre for supporters of human rights, could not have been in a more inaccessible building."
8588,building,"the reception desk required id of anyone entering the building, and the café lounge downstairs was run by the building management itself and admitted only residents and their guests."
8589,state,"during those years in iran when the state had assigned me “bodyguards,” out of ostensible fear for my safety, it had been a form of intense surveillance."
8590,burglar,"iranian intelligence agents were energetically active in europe; a number of exiled iranian dissidents and journalists had had their laptops stolen in mysterious thefts in which the burglar took nothing else of value, and london’s universities were a favorite finishing school for young islamic republic spies."
8591,building,"because i traveled so much, a small office posed no problems, and i had imagined that this glass building in hammersmith, where nearly everyone was british and went about in formal business attire, would be suitable."
8592,where,"he started with “what are you doing here in london?” and continued with endless questions: about what my dealings with iran currently were, where i received my funding, who i worked with."
8593,interrogation,"it reminded me of a tehran interrogation session, the kind i had endured so many times in my life."
8594,power,"we talked about a number of things, but i made the point again that although the iranian government viewed me with great suspicion as some kind of political alternative to the current regime, i hadn’t the slightest desire for political power."
8595,authorities,"i knew the authorities didn’t believe it, and that the man sitting beside me probably did not, either."
8596,prisoners,"at such a tumultuous moment in history, with the middle east festering with open conflict, and iran a country teeming with prisoners and political opposition of seventy stripes?"
8597,power,perhaps they themselves are so addicted to power and privilege that they imagine others must be seeking the same.
8598,where,"they ask me so repeatedly where i receive my funding, while they know—their files document—that i have never been corrupt, and the way i live my life has shown that."
8599,law,"that i worked in human rights, that my work was legal, and that i did not contravene iranian law in the process and had never done so."
8600,law,"i told him about the activities the centre for supporters of human rights was now actively pursuing, promoting research and understanding around the compatibility of islam and an egalitarian legal framework for women, particularly in the realm of family law."
8601,thief,"“but i could have become as wealthy as him.”  i remained silent, and didn’t say that babak zanjani was an outrageous thief."
8602,where,"“we’re moving out in january.”  “oh, where are you going?”  “we’re moving to the united nations in new york."
8603,notorious,"even the most notorious officials, the hanging judges associated with the worst human rights abuses and the officials close to the nuclear program who are on the european union’s list of sanctioned officials prohibited from traveling to the west, have alternative passports."
8604,state,"these authentic documents are produced by the state but show different identities, enabling these men to travel despite sanctions."
8605,inside,"months have passed and the office sits empty, the lights off and the little glass window that looks out onto the corridor blocked from the inside with a piece of cardboard."
8606,inside,i think about the listening equipment that must be inside and wonder whether it has gathered dust.
8607,power,"i am accustomed to gazing at mountains, and the outline of the alborz is still etched in my mind, but i try to remind myself that i am not the first iranian who has lost her country because of speaking truth to power."
8608,justice,"since persian poets first began committing verse to paper, we have been able to trace our country’s long struggle for justice through literature, and perhaps this is why iranians take such solace in satire."
8609,trial,"one evening in london, the great iranian satirist hadi khorsandi staged a play, in persian, called the trial of shirin ebadi’s sister."
8610,court,his mobile rang with the news that the police were bringing shirin ebadi’s sister into his court for trial.
8611,interrogation,"every time she tried to interject, he shouted at her, “be quiet, or i’ll execute you!” though it was an interrogation, the judge posed and answered his own questions, as the woman grew more agitated."
8612,courtroom,"when the judge returns to the courtroom, she bursts out before he has a chance to speak: “please, just listen for one second."
8613,court,"i’m here to take your blood pressure!”  and the story ends like this, a satire of justice in the iranian court system."
8614,arrest,"khorsandi said he was inspired by something i said in the wake of my sister’s arrest: “when they do this to a sister of a nobel laureate, imagine what they do to a nameless student or a journalist without a reputation.”  the play, i hope and pray, will only be a footnote in my story."
8615,taken,"it is for the sake of iran and its people, its potential and its greatness, that i have taken each and every step along this journey."
8616,justice,and i know that one day iranians will find their own path to the freedom and justice they deserve.
8617,inside,"for ordinary iranians inside the country, who have lived for the past decade under the threat of a potential american or israeli military attack, and who have suffered the devastating impact of sanctions, the deal is cause for great hope."
8618,inside,"they want their government to spend whatever funds it does gain access to on iranians inside the country, rather than on weapons for hezbollah in lebanon or bashar al-assad’s troops in syria."
8619,power,"iran, as the only country with an overwhelming shia majority, seeks to assert itself as the leading shia power in the world, to cultivate shias in other countries, and to encourage them to rise up against their rulers."
8620,war,"it is hard to imagine an islamic republic that is at peace with the united states, for a revolution not perpetually at war with its enemies becomes duty bound to be accountable to its citizens."
8621,freedom,"like all my countrypeople, i will watch and wait eagerly, hoping for a path that opens up, ultimately, onto freedom."
8622,state,"by reading it, you will see how a police state can affect people’s lives and throw families into disarray."
8623,lawyer,"what you can take away from my personal story is this: if a government can behave in this way with a nobel peace laureate who has access to the platform of world media, and who is herself a lawyer with intimate knowledge of the country’s legal system, you can imagine what it does to ordinary iranians, who have no such means or expertise at their disposal."
8624,prisoners,"i am compelled to share my story on behalf of the many faceless iranians, political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, who sit today in the prisons of iran, an iran that has become one of the world’s largest prisons for journalists, lawyers, women’s rights activists, and students, who instead of studying are languishing in cellblocks, yet another generation whose talent and dreams are squandered."
8625,state,but the hardship imposed by the iranian police state has not caused the people of iran to lose their hope for change or their willingness to reach for it.
8626,law,"in the 1990s ebadi returned to the law as a defender of women’s and children’s rights, founding a human rights center that spearheaded legal reform and public debate around the islamic republic’s discriminatory laws."
8627,prisoners,she has defended many of the country’s most prominent prisoners of conscience and spent nearly a month in prison in 1999 for her activities.

8629,question,i knew a party was out of the question; we were in mourning.
8630,taken,"it was out of sheer helplessness that she had taken my hand in hers and set off for mufid’s, a store that was piled to the ceiling with barbie dolls and colorful toys."
8631,where,"we didn’t want to know where they planned to gather, and we weren’t interested in the mullahs or that surly old man with the crooked black eyebrows either."
8632,wall,"when we had been in england for the summer holidays, my mother had gotten upset when she read the words “death to the shah” written in persian on the wall in the london metro."
8633,freedom,"she was proud of the shah’s pledge to safeguard the freedom and progress of the women of iran, and of all the opportunities he had opened up for them."
8634,guard,"before the main entrance, a pretty young official with black hair stood guard."
8635,wall,she led me out of the ruckus to the wall at the edge of the courtyard.
8636,building,"every time the angry students rotated past the front of the main building, the older boys would lift chairs dragged from the classrooms above their heads and brandish them at the principal’s office, chanting, “baroye hefz-e shishe, madresseh bayad ta’til sh-e” (for the sake of the windowpanes, the school must be closed)."
8637,inside,"that day, she and the other teachers stayed timidly inside, glancing anxiously down at the revolt."
8638,building,"the windows of the building shattered one by one, and there was nothing for the school authorities to do but close the schools and join the strike."
8639,law,the government declared martial law and a nine o’clock curfew.
8640,police,"we heard that police had opened fire at a large demonstration at meidan zhale, killing hundreds."
8641,death,"death to the traitor shah!” at first kati and i would clean as much as we could reach off our walls, but eventually we had to content ourselves with making sure to remove the most dangerous of the slogans: “savaki.” it was rumored that my father was an employee of the shah’s secret intelligence service."
8642,crimes,"in those days, you’d hear terrifying stories about the crimes of the savak and how they killed and tortured those opposed to the shah’s regime."
8643,imprisoned,"to a certain extent, censorship of the press had been lifted, and in a show of combating corruption, he’d arrested and imprisoned about a 120 leading state officials, among them the head of the savak, general ne’matollah nasiri, and prime minister amir abbas hovida."
8644,death,but the people responded to these token gestures by repeating khomeini’s words: “the shah must go.” the people saw the savakis as bloodthirsty traitors who deserved to be put to death.
8645,arrested,"the tudeh-i were very active in the first months of the revolution, before ayatollah khomeini outlawed their activities, arrested their leaders, and executed large numbers of their members."
8646,freedom,"she was peaceful and kind, and she afforded her daughter every kind of freedom."
8647,where,"this was in contrast to the customs of the day, where suitors would normally just show up, and families would be obliged to submit their daughters for marriage."
8648,roads,"its roads were so quiet that if a car sometimes broke the silence, it was usually the shah traveling between the palace in sa’adabad and the palace in saheb gharaneyeh."
8649,where,"i ran to where the desert began just so i could wave at him from the roadside, and the shah would always wave back."
8650,where,"if my father happened to be passing within earshot, he’d pick up where she left off."
8651,where,we rode around in a nice car and ate expensive food and bought our clothes in london from harrods where my mother once tipped the salesclerk fifty pounds.
8652,where,"what did we know about the neighborhoods called halabiyabad in south tehran, where people lived in houses made of tin gas-cans?"
8653,roads,"many towns had neither electricity, nor proper roads, nor schools, nor hospitals, nor did they meet even the most basic standards of hygiene."
8654,detainees,how many people had been forced to spend years being beaten and tortured in prison as political detainees?
8655,death,"of course it had to be in black, because she was still mourning the death of my grandfather."

8657,guard,"a revolutionary group had ambushed the parade, and the guard was returning their fire."
8658,death,"people were chanting “death to the shah” and “martyrs have been struck down.” from then on, my mother decided we would stay at home and follow the revolution on the tv screen."
8659,war,bakhtiar gave his resignation and announced his intention to leave for france to prevent civil war and further bloodshed.
8660,freedom,"when khomeini arrived in tehran, he went straight to behesht-e zahra and proclaimed, “mohammed reza shah has laid waste to the cities and populated the cemeteries.” he sounded the glad tidings of freedom for the people of iran—glad tidings of abundant water and electricity and the equal partitioning of oil revenue."
8661,police,my uncle manuchehr (really my father’s first cousin) was an officer in the bureau of investigation and worked at the tehran police department.
8662,thief,"he was over at our house a few weeks after khomeini arrived in iran, and he pointed out that one of the men escorting khomeini’s chevrolet was a thief, a fugitive with a long record."
8663,notorious,every time they showed a segment on khomeini’s reception we’d run up to the television screen and point out to everyone the notorious thief.
8664,police,uncle manuchehr later told us that this same thief had become a person of importance and visited police headquarters of his own accord.
8665,arrest,"he proudly greeted the force, and no one had the courage to say a word, let alone arrest him."
8666,executed,"the first to be executed was the former head of the savak, general ne’matollah nasiri."
8667,execution,"every day, people—some innocent, some bearing varying degrees of guilt—were delivered in groups to the revolutionary execution unit."
8668,justice,there were neither courts nor defense attorneys; a council bearing the name revolutionary justice approved the executions on the spot.
8669,executed,it was even rumored that he personally executed former prime minister amir abbas hovida.
8670,where,"but instead of the revolutionaries, it was my young uncle, ali, who came to our house late one night with a sandbag full of weapons and hid it in the closet where my mother kept her clothes."
8671,where,"and never go into your mother’s closet.” we both nodded, but from then on our greatest source of amusement was to go to the closet and look at all the different kinds of weapons, having no idea where they came from or what they might be used for."
8672,taken,years later i learned that they had been taken in raids on army bases during the climactic days of the revolution.
8673,freedom,"march 21, 1979 that year, when nouruz, the iranian new year, came it seemed most of the country was in great spirits—the people had resolved this was their first “spring in freedom.” but my family was lost and confused."
8674,where,my father believed this neighborhood would come to be much more convenient and fashionable than the desert where my cousin omid lived.
8675,taken,those shares were taken over after the revolution by the mustazafin foundation.
8676,where,many in the factory where my father worked had become revolutionaries and joined the hezbollah and were keeping tabs on one other.
8677,law,"at the factory, a new office of supervision had been instituted by the new government’s internal intelligence division, and the director, agha-ye khabiri, a well-educated, competent, and respected man who was my uncle’s brother-in-law, had been dismissed and agha-ye mutlabi, who was the driver of the doogh vending truck, had been made the director of the factory."
8678,crime,"my mother’s aunt fakhri had her home repossessed for the crime that her husband had been agha-ye khan malak yazdi, the chief of the wealthy association, the pious department."
8679,guard,"in contrast, my maternal uncle ali, by virtue of being with the revolutionary guard, ended up with a fine piece of land behind the shah’s palace on niyavaran in shemiran, and brought his young wife, iran-dokht, to live there."
8680,guard,the revolutionary guard would stop expensive cars to check the identities of their owners.
8681,guard,"my paternal grandfather’s cousin was amujan timsar, “dearest uncle the major general.” he had been the security chief of tehran and would boast that he had had the title “his majesty’s private guard.” we all knew his daughter mahnavaz, who was the same age as my aunt turan, had once been approached by queen turan, reza shah’s third wife, for marriage with the shah’s half-brother, shahpur gholamreza."
8682,execution,"our ever-present television constantly broadcast interrogations of those condemned to execution, exposing the “traitors to the nation.” then one night, we were shocked to see the image of my grandfather’s cousin agha-ye sayf-allah shahandeh."
8683,arrested,"he had gone into hiding, and we had heard that he had recently been arrested along with his daughter, guli."
8684,executed,they executed him and held his funeral at an undisclosed location.
8685,conviction,"though many revolutionary families would be ashamed to have a relative executed, i was proud of my family’s history because it showed strength and conviction."
8686,jail,"two decades later, when i was taken to jail, i know my family was waiting anxiously to see if i would suddenly end up on national television."
8687,where,"1 elementary school, where katayun was enrolled in the fourth grade."
8688,law,"head coverings were not yet mandatory at elementary school (the law went into effect when i started 3rd grade) and no one wore the hejab, but this coarse, olive-skinned girl wore a long black veil."
8689,gate,"when my friends and i reached the front gate of our school one morning, we saw custodians with buckets and giant brushes in hand, painting something on the ground."
8690,taken,"they had taken sixty-six americans hostage, demanding that america return the shah to iran."
8691,death,"torkan had taken her place in front of the microphone and called out with great excitement, “our motto of the day?” and we had to respond, “marg bar amrika” (death to america or down with america)."
8692,inside,inside we sang and clapped and generally misbehaved.
8693,war,we instantly changed our mission and went from chanting to waging war against these boys.
8694,pen,after that the teacher’s assistant got on the bus with a pen and paper to write down the names of the unruly students whose marks for discipline would be penalized.
8695,term,we were told that everyone’s mark for conduct for the term would be lowered by one grade.
8696,authority,"every time uncle bizhan saw us, he’d lower his voice and intimate that he had it on authority that in a certain month the regime would fall."
8697,authority,"and when that date had passed, another authority would give him a new date."
8698,killing,a group by the name of forqan took to killing prominent revolutionary figures.
8699,guard,there’d be bearded men wearing the green uniforms of the revolutionary guard sticking their hands in our purses and handbags.
8700,arrested,my sister and i would plead with her—we knew that being arrested by the imam’s guards was very dangerous and would be a serious headache.
8701,abuse,but she ignored us and would rain down a torrent of abuse on whichever guard had his turn that day.
8702,arrest,"but sometimes the brothers would call headquarters on the wireless, planning to arrest us and send us to the komité."
8703,building,"the new owner had rented the building out to faezeh hashemi, the owner and editor in chief of zan, with hossein agha in tow."
8704,building,"at least twice a week in the afternoon, i’d creep silently into the building like a shadow, and a few hours later, i’d go home."
8705,building,"along with hossein agha the gardener, two guards also remained from when zan was housed in the building: farhad, an afghan, and ali, from kermanshah."

8715,court,"the day before, i had been moved from towhid prison to the revolutionary court for my first court appearance."
8716,arrest,all i had to cover my head was the black overcoat that i had thrown on when they came to arrest me.
8717,guard,"taibeh khanum, the plump guard with half-blond frizzy hair who specialized in dream interpretation, auxiliary prayers, and in all manner of irregular religious supplication, had lent me her black chador."

8719,locked,"the women who guarded us, from the moment their shift started until the following morning, were locked in just like us."
8720,court,"when i came back from court, my head ached and my wrists hurt so much i couldn’t move them."
8721,cell,"they took a look at my petite form and said, “who is going to marry such a weak and sickly girl!” the next morning, before i was to be moved again to the courthouse, my interrogator visited my cell block with a plastic bag."
8722,where,we wore them to funerals at the behesht-e zahra or to government offices where “sisters without chadors will not be received.” they were worn when we went with my mother to the imamzadehs to pray and make votive offerings.
8723,guard,"now the chador was in the hands of leila, the fat prison guard."
8724,guard,"one after another, each guard said a little piece, using the chador to judge my family."
8725,guard,leila’s world was the world of her revolutionary guard husband.

8728,cell,"inside my cell, i buried my face in the black fabric."

8731,situation,"i needed love and the power of love to change my desperate situation, and the person closest to me was the person i saw every day, my interrogator."

8734,wall,"we had never seen each other, as i always faced the wall in the interrogation room."
8735,arrested,"sometimes, in the room together, he’d put photos in front of me, taken from the album the guards had seized from my room when they arrested me."
8736,question,"he’d chosen some photos from my vacations, to germany or southern france, where i was wearing a bikini, and he’d ask me, “aren’t you ashamed to be dressed like that!” i’d see beyond the harsh question and my meek answer, and would imagine a pious, religious man afraid of his forbidden love, battling with himself as he looked through my photos one by one."
8737,war,chapter three snapshots of the war september 1980 “attention!
8738,state,"the signal that you are now hearing, the signal that you are now hearing is a declaration of a state of red alert."

8740,where,"my mother, sister, and i had recently returned to tehran from frankfurt, where we’d been waiting for my father to join us."
8741,situation,"we had gone to germany after my parents finally realized that the situation in iran for people like us, with our background, was only getting worse."
8742,war,"at the beginning of the war, enemy planes were constantly breaking the sound barrier with a dreadful sound, and my grandmother, along with everyone else in tehran, had secured all the windows of her house with an x of thick duct tape so that, in the event of a nearby explosion, the shattered glass would not end up strewn about inside our house."
8743,building,"my classroom was on the third floor, and we’d drop our books and notebooks in a rush and hurl ourselves out of the building, terrified we’d wind up buried under falling debris."
8744,where,the superintendents never could figure out where the rumors started and could only decry our wickedness over the loudspeakers after we were back to the white level of alert.

8750,wall,"but he led from exile, and his portrait printed on this cement wall was still in good shape."

9160,locked,my mother rarely locked the front door to our apartment—i simply turned the knob and stepped in.
9161,where,"yasbanu looked up from where she was playing on the floor, her face frozen in amazement."
9162,locked,my eyes were locked in a squint.
9163,officers,"every day, i stood at the window and watched for the officers to return, waiting for him to call ."
9164,charged,"there-after he carried it, hidden in his planner, whenever we met, in case anyone arrested him and charged him with having an improper relationship with me."
9165,inside,"i thought about how people joked in iran about zan-e sighehi, how they show clients they’re waiting by wearing their chador turned inside out."
9166,arrested,"i calmed myself by thinking that the sigheh was shameful for him, too, for his wife and family and that we would never let anyone know about it unless he was arrested."
9167,where,sometimes we drove far out of tehran to find places where we could sit together in public.
9168,where,we’d travel up north or northeast to small shops where only tourists on their way to the caspian sea would stop and where there was almost no chance we’d be recognized.
9169,where,"to a gynecologist’s office on haft-e tir, where a friend of his was the practicing doctor."
9170,locked,"by mistake his son opened the door, and our eyes locked."

9172,building,"“keep your head down so you don’t know where you are,” he had said as we approached the building."
9173,where,i knew exactly where i was.
9174,where,"“you have to take your shoes off in a house where people pray,” he reminded me."
9175,wall,"in their large dining room, like in most iranian homes, there were objects adorning every surface—bowls with birds engraved on them, religious wall-hangings, and a piece of black fabric in an elaborate inlaid frame."
9176,question,even now i can’t answer that question.
9177,where,"he was looking down at me, where i sat on the thick rug."

9182,court,the deed to my mother’s apartment had already been put in the custody of the revolutionary court to make bail (it was worth about ten-million and she’d paid cash to make up the rest).
9183,prisoners,"compared to other released prisoners, the cost wasn’t that much—amir had handled everything to let me out relatively easily and quickly."
9184,escaped,"i heard that she claimed i’d never even been in towhid—that it was all a set-up, that she hadn’t abandoned me but had instead escaped some trap herself."
9185,freedom,"how could i tell anyone about the debasement, the humiliation, and the suffering that i’d endured to restore my freedom?"
9186,state,"i would tell my friends and family that i was fine, that i felt normal, but i wasn’t fine or in any ordinary state."
9187,war,"he’d gone with his family to karbala in iraq to visit shrines, along with one of the first groups of shi’a pilgrims after the war."
9188,where,there have been many cases where repented mujaheds have married the single brothers who interrogated them.
9189,charge,but what are we going to do when this time the brother who has fallen in love with his charge already has a wife and children?”  i wasn’t in love anymore.
9190,where,where was i going with this man?
9191,building,"i hated being without my real work as a reporter and instead writing daily reports for him that were full of nothing, of boring details that were less than lies: “i went to a café by the caspian sea with faezeh and her daughter and son, and we talked about sports and my assignments for saba.” he’d shake his head and say, “what kind of a spy are you?”  april 2000 he found a vacant apartment building in sa’adat-abad and convinced the realtor to give him the key."
9192,inside,"people would stand outside their doors and invite passersby inside, and mourners would stand in line with pots held out to take the food home to their families."
9193,where,"it was around noon when he dropped me off at meidan tajrish, where i took a cab to jamaran."
9194,freed,"though it had been almost six months, they examined me as though i’d been freed yesterday."
9195,arrested,you tell me that he told you himself that he had signed death warrants for young girls in prison not all that long before you were arrested.
9196,case,"believe me, you’re the strangest case i’ve ever worked.” there were a lot of things i had figured out."
9197,case,"i’d figured out that he enjoyed high status in the ministry as a special consultant, that he was the chief investigator on my case."
9198,law,"she was suspicious alone for being ayatollah khomeini’s granddaughter, and in addition she was now president khatami’s sister-in-law."
9199,death,"now, i was fleeing under threat of death."
9200,where,where did you say you are?” “with faezeh.” my mother knew that the line might be tapped.
9201,wall,i looked at the framed photos on my wall and at my unfinished watercolor paintings.
9202,inside,"i took the plastic bag he handed to me with presents he’d brought, and when i looked inside i saw he’d given me pistachios packed in a little heart-shaped bamboo box."
9203,inside,there was also an envelope with two hundred dollars inside—about a month’s salary in iran.

9209,charge,i’ll put agha-ye abtahi in charge of your case.
9210,where,"the next time i met abtahi in person was at an opec summit in caracas, where he told me he’d held several meetings with the minister of intelligence, agha-ye ali yunusi, and that khatami had requested all my files from the judiciary."
9211,authorities,"“your files have been lost by the judicial authorities,” agha-ye abtahi told me finally."
9212,case,"apparently, the ministry of intelligence had been displeased that khatami was investigating my case."
9213,power,"he had helped me as much as he could, but it was shocking to realize again the limits of khatami’s power."
9214,freedom,"another cleric, agha-ye du’ai, stopped and told me, “pray for us and for agha-ye khatami.”  and thus immigration and self-imposed exile led me unexpectedly to the life i’d always wanted, full of freedom, security, and journalistic opportunities."

9240,authorities,"my work as the director of the middle east program at the woodrow wilson center in washington, d.c., on the other hand, merely involved organizing talks and conferences on middle eastern issues, and hardly merited the attention of the iranian authorities."
9241,law,"his mother-in-law was sick, he said; he might have to go to the provinces, to tabriz."
9242,cell,"i had called my mother earlier to wish her good night; we had hung up, but i was still holding the cell phone in my hand, unsure what was happening, thinking that perhaps we had a flat tire."
9243,ordered,"one, a tall, burly man with a crude persian accent, ordered modarress to switch off the motor, open the trunk, and hand him the car keys."

9250,cell,modarress said they hadn’t taken his cell phone—a much-prized possession in tehran.
9251,taken,"they hadn’t taken his wallet, either."
9252,police,the highway police told modarress that we should stay put and wait for them.
9253,cell,i used modarress’s cell phone to call my mother.
9254,police,"i had also read of iranians being beaten up and thrown, half-dead, into alleys—the ugly handiwork, it was thought, of the secret police."

9256,police,it took an hour for a police car to show up.
9257,police,"two officers, neat and businesslike in their uniforms, motioned for us to get into the back of the police car."
9258,police,"i had been standing on the highway with modarress as we waited for the police, not wishing to sit in our car after the robbery."
9259,officers,"i was now grateful to be out of the cold, but modarress, mindful of iranian protocol, preferred to stand outside and answer the officers’ questions through the window."
9260,robbery,"as we gave a detailed account of the robbery, the policemen shook their heads, as if in disbelief."
9261,police,"they had me sign the completed report, gave me a copy, and told me to take it to the police station at shahrak-e gharb, a seven-minute car ride from mutti’s apartment."
9262,police,"i didn’t know how we were going to get to the police station or home, since modarress had surrendered his car keys during the robbery."
9263,police,"at two-thirty in the morning, the police station had an abandoned look to it."
9264,cell,a sleepy guard registered our names and took away modarress’s cell phone.
9265,building,“go home and report back first thing in the morning.” all the lights were on in my mother’s apartment in the otherwise dark building.
9266,robbery,"he said he would go back to the scene of the robbery to look for my iranian passport and papers, since it was quite common for thieves to take the money and valuables from a purse and throw everything else on the side of the road."
9267,robbery,"i still thought this was a simple robbery, and shaul agreed with me."
9268,robbery,my first call the morning after the robbery was to my cousin farhad.
9269,robbery,i told him about the robbery.
9270,police,"our first stop, once modarress joined us, was the neighborhood police station."
9271,cell,"men and women were there reporting burglaries, family disputes, and thefts of cell phones."
9272,arrested,police officers walked in with men who had been arrested in a drug bust.
9273,robbery,"i had to repeat over and over the details of the robbery, fill out forms, secure signatures and official stamps."
9274,police,"we needed the signature of the police chief, but he was on a hajj, or pilgrimage, to mecca, and his deputy had not yet come in."
9275,court,"the deputy finally arrived, read the report, remarked nonchalantly that “such things happen,” signed the papers, and sent us to the revolutionary magistrate’s court on my mother’s street to have the police report certified."
9276,court,"on the way to the court, modarress, who was following us in his own car, rang farhad on his cell phone to say he was having a problem with his brakes and couldn’t stay with us."
9277,court,"the two entrances to the revolutionary magistrate’s court were separated by a curtain, denoting one side for men and the other for women."
9278,robbery,"he, too, seemed to think he was dealing with a simple robbery."
9279,where,"the ministry of foreign affairs, where i needed to go for a letter of authorization before my new passport could be issued, was housed in the former headquarters of the anglo-iranian oil company."
9280,power,the era when the british had exercised considerable power and influence in iran was long gone.
9281,building,the street names around the building were also long gone.
9282,ordered,the clerk ordered tea and got down to work.
9283,robbery,"many people had called my mother when they learned of the robbery, one of whom had even heard that i had been robbed, beaten, and hospitalized."
9284,robbery,"like me, they had no reason to suspect anything other than that i had simply been the unfortunate victim of a robbery."
9285,robbery,"“this was no ordinary robbery,” ferry’s wife said."
9286,robbery,"“it was a robbery, pure and simple.” the passport office the next day, a sunday, we went to the passport office on sattar khan avenue in west tehran."
9287,guard,the female guard on my side of the curtain conducted a superficial search of my purse and let me through.
9288,state,"in the first decade after the revolution, smiles on the faces of mid-level civil servants were rare, deemed a sign of frivolousness, unseemly in an islamic state."
9289,freedom,"during khatami’s presidency, university students—men and women—mixed more freely; women fought for and secured more freedom in matters of dress; color returned to clothing on the streets; young girls moved about the city with hair showing beneath their headscarves, their nails polished, a touch of lipstick on their lips."
9290,where,"we ended up in a large room, where, we were told, the final approval for a new passport would be issued."
9291,wall,"on the wall, as in all government offices, were pictures of the founder of the islamic republic, ayatollah khomeini; the current supreme leader, ayatollah khamenei; and president ahmadinejad."
9292,charge,"the lone man in the room, obviously in charge, sat at his own desk, at some distance from the women."
9293,charge,"finally, the man in charge called my name and handed me two letters."
9294,police,"it was responsible for internal security, and was the regime’s political watchdog, its secret police."
9295,building,i was directed to see a mr. torabi in the same building.
9296,case,"i do not know if this was his real name or a fictitious one, as was often the case with intelligence ministry officials i later encountered."
9297,cell,"the next day i went with kami to take care of my cell phone, which was now in the hands of my assailants."
9298,cell,"in iran, you can buy a cell phone at a variety of stores, but a number has to be purchased from the government phone company."
9299,cell,i had to cancel my old cell phone number and purchase a new one.
9300,court,"at the telephone company office, i handed over a batch of documents to a clerk: my “deed” of ownership, the barely legible xerox copy of my birth certificate as proof of identity, and the police report, duly notarized by the revolutionary magistrate’s court, attesting that my cell phone had been stolen."
9301,robbery,he went over the robbery with me again and asked me a few more questions.
9302,robbery,his manner alternated between solicitous official —“tell me again about the robbery”—and faceless bureaucrat—“date of birth?
9303,law,"a few of the questions seemed unnecessarily intrusive: occupation and employer of husband, daughter, son-in-law, sister, brother."
9304,state,"ja’fari seemed overly interested in the details of my wilson center salary: amount, deductions for federal and state taxes and for social security and retirement, the biweekly method of payment."
9305,police,"i came to understand only much later that, in the style of the now-defunct east german secret police, the stasi, the iranian secret police collected masses of information, no matter how insignificant or useless, on everyone who happened to attract their attention."
9306,officers,"as with the stasi, such information contributed nothing to  national security, but fat dossiers were regarded as proof of “thoroughness” and helped inflate the self-regard of the intelligence officers."
9307,question,i failed to catch the implied menace in the question.
9308,robbery,"notwithstanding a very few friends’ skeptical attitudes, i still believed i was the victim of an ordinary robbery and this was routine clearance before a new passport could be issued."
9309,confinement,"mr. ja’fari, which may or may not have been his real name, was to become my constant but unwelcome “companion” in the weeks and months ahead—an unshakable and controlling presence throughout a terrifying interrogation that would stretch out over the next eight months, nearly four of them spent in solitary confinement at evin prison."
9310,war,"on the european side, my maternal grandfather, who died in world war i, owned a hotel in marienbad, in czechoslovakia, and my mother’s older brother was a cloth merchant in prague."
9311,where,"for the first six years of my life i lived in karaj, twenty-five miles from tehran, where my father was a professor of botany at the college of agriculture."
9312,wall,"unlike traditional persian homes, our garden didn’t have a wall around it, but pine trees served to shield it from the street."
9313,toilet,"we had a large living room and a dining room, several bedrooms, and a bathroom with a bathtub and a persian-style toilet, basically a basin sunk in the floor."
9314,state,"unable to persuade a proud and stubborn reza shah—the military officer who seized power in 1921, sent the qajar dynasty packing, and founded a new dynasty in 1925—to abandon iran’s state of neutrality and join the allied cause, russia and britain invaded iran in  august 1941, the russians from the north, the british from the south."
9315,where,"my grandmother’s home was another world, utterly different from our european household, where we spoke german, followed strict rules, sat around the table to have our meals, and ate austrian food—schnitzel, boiled meat, soup, roast potatoes, and creamed spinach."
9316,where,"my favorite place was the kitchen, which was dark and smoky from the woodstove, and where the cook would often slip me a spoonful of white rice from the cooking pot."
9317,where,"the house had a large garden with a pond where the household, including my grandmother, made their ablutions before each of the five daily prayers."
9318,taken,"one of the first steps taken by the islamic republic after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979 was to reimpose hijab, or islamic dress, on women."
9319,situation,"but by then, the situation was reversed."
9320,death,"she was kind and welcoming to both her foreign-born daughter-in-law and son-in-law, and with her death in 1973, a piece of the cherished iran of my childhood vanished along with her."
9321,war,she had not returned to vienna since coming to iran—europe had been at war—and she had been longing to go back.
9322,war,her youngest brother had died in the war and her two older sisters had moved to the united states.
9323,locked,the conductor who checked our tickets told mutti to keep the door of our compartment locked at all times.
9324,where,"mother, who did not believe in idleness, immediately enrolled me in the neighborhood school, where i learned to speak czech."
9325,war,"uncle max tried to dissuade her or, at least, to prepare her for the devastation the city had endured from bombing during the war."
9326,officers,suddenly the door of the compartment opened and three or four austrian and czech officers flipped on the light and asked to see our passports and our bags.
9327,officers,"i started crying and clung to mother, wishing again we had stayed in uncle max’s beautiful apartment; the woman scolded the officers for frightening a child."
9328,officers,"the officers left with our passports, and one of them soon returned and handed mutti our documents but told the woman to follow him."
9329,where,"an hour later, the woman reappeared and without turning on the light asked mother where her package was."
9330,building,she would point at the ruin of a house or building: this was where she had lived as a child; this was where she had gone to school; this was the park where she played; the theater she attended.
9331,building,we went in search of the building where father had lived as a student and to the faculty of agriculture at tuerkishenspark where he had gone to university.
9332,where,"we walked along the stadtpark, where she and father had danced the waltz, past the opera house and the very exclusive sacher hotel and café mozart."
9333,where,"in the spring, when we boarded a train for ankara, where a cousin of my father served as the iranian ambassador, then another train to baghdad, and finally a bus to iran, we left my fairy-tale city behind."
9334,power,"political parties—mossadegh’s own national front; the communist tudeh party; the ultranationalist sumka party, whose members, fascist-style, sported black shirts; the toilers party, headed by a politician from my family’s ancestral home, kerman—vied for popularity and power, while their adherents in secondary schools and tehran university clashed with one another on the streets."
9335,death,"mossadegh was our hero, and we, like other students, took up the shout, “ya marg, ya mossadegh”—“death or mossadegh.” politicians considered insufficiently ardent on the oil nationalization issue, including mossadegh’s predecessor as prime minister, ali razmara, were assassinated."
9336,murder,his murder brought the mindless violence close to home.
9337,where,"mutti, siamack, and i moved with father to the city of abadan, where two years later, my sister, hayedeh, was born."
9338,taken,"when the oil industry was taken over and the british driven out, all these facilities were seized by the iranian government."
9339,freedom,"but for a curious child, abadan meant a recovery of freedom."
9340,punishment,"jeanne d’arc had been strict, but punishment had meant sitting alone in a corner or being banished from the classroom."
9341,authority,"the british were determined to undo the oil industry’s nationalization, which had meant the loss of a valuable asset as well as a challenge to their imperial authority."
9342,power,mossadegh was also locked in a struggle with the shah over power and constitutional authority; things seemed unstable as demonstrators took over the streets.
9343,situation,"in the evenings, my relatives heatedly debated the situation."
9344,power,"the family was divided, some loyal to mossadegh and others to the shah; some enthusiastic about oil nationalization, others worried about the direction in which mossadegh was taking the country: “he is allowing the left and the communists too much power.” “no, he is the only politician who dared stand up to the british and defend iran’s honor.” “yes, but he is leading the country into anarchy.” so went the arguments, back and forth."
9345,police,"brigadier general mohammad afshartous, mossadegh’s police chief, who was kidnapped and murdered, had married into the bayat family."
9346,authority,"mossadegh was also challenging the shah’s authority, asserting the primacy of parliament and his prerogatives as prime minister."
9347,war,"in july 1952, mossadegh resigned when both he and the shah claimed the right to name the minister of war."
9348,authority,members of the family were torn: they felt instinctive loyalty to their famous relative; some found attractive the idea championed by mossadegh that authority should rest with the parliament and that the shah should reign and not rule.
9349,term,but they also feared for the stability of the throne and the long-term stability of the country; and mossadegh’s seeming radicalism made them uneasy.
9350,officers,"royalist officers in the army were won over; newspaper editors, members of parliament, and politicians were paid off; the cooperation of political operators who could mobilize the street crowds was secured."
9351,jailed,"they were devastated to see mossadegh’s home ransacked, and the prime minister put on trial and jailed."
9352,authoritarianism,"even if i wasn’t fully conscious of it at the time, it was during these years that i came to appreciate the value of freedom of thought and expression, the right to travel and explore, and freedom from authoritarianism."
9353,tortured,"they had spent time in prison after the overthrow of mossadegh, and some of them had been tortured."
9354,term,"“does this zaifeh—this weak one—understand anything?” an older reporter once sneered, using a traditional and derogatory term for women."
9355,building,"the toilet in the building was for men only, meaning i simply could not go to the bathroom all day."
9356,freed,"he had freed up the press, allowed non-communist political parties to operate, and decentralized the economy."
9357,arrested,dubček and his colleagues as well as czech activists and intellectuals had been arrested.
9358,ordered,"sometimes he ordered the removal of a name or a paragraph, sometimes a whole story."
9359,locked,"one day, before i joined kayhan, the journalists took advantage of mahram ali khan’s visit to the men’s room, locked him in, and pretended they could not open the door."
9360,state,"i began to cover visits to iran by ministers, officials, and foreign heads of state."
9361,taken,i had taken to shaul immediately.
9362,where,"two years into our marriage, in 1966, shaul decided he would like to return to harvard, where he had gone to college, to study for an ma in middle eastern studies."

9364,jail,"he kept jobs open for colleagues who went to jail, took care of their families, and reemployed them once they were released."
9365,state,"he allowed reporters who were banned by the shah’s secret police, savak (the persian acronym for organization for state security and intelligence), to write for kayhan under assumed names."
9366,building,"when he walked into the newsroom a few minutes later and took his seat behind the editor’s desk, one colleague and i gathered up our belongings and walked out of the newsroom and the building."
9367,taken,"mahnaz, a dynamic american-educated feminist, had taken over a dormant organization in 1970 and turned it into an effective instrument to promote women’s causes."
9368,ordered,reza shah had already ordered the abolition of the veil.
9369,law,"the 1967 family protection law, amended and expanded in 1975, restricted the ability of men to take more than one wife and to secure divorce on demand."
9370,custody,"it gave women the right to seek divorce, and strengthened women’s rights in child-custody cases."
9371,custody,"it ran family-planning clinics; it provided women with legal advice; and guided them on their rights in child custody, divorce, and spousal-abuse cases."
9372,law,both phases of the family-protection law required patient negotiation with cabinet ministers and members of parliament.
9373,justice,"in 1967, the minister of justice journeyed to the shrine city of najaf in iraq, the center of shi’ism’s most prestigious religious seminaries, to persuade ayatollah kho’i, then the highest-ranking and most eminent clerical leader in the shi’ite world, to lend his support to the new family-protection law."
9374,inside,i traveled fairly widely inside the country.
9375,law,"the new government, however, suspended the family protection law, encouraged women in the civil service to take early retirement, and discouraged women in general from working."
9376,arrest,"in this, they risked arrest, even lashings, but gradually won for themselves more freedom in matters of dress."
9377,law,working-class and traditional women continued to be at the forefront of the struggle to reinstate the family protection law.

9379,where,"we were also running cultural centers in the capital, where we organized art exhibitions, art workshops, lectures, and seminars."
9380,repression,yet political stability had been purchased at a price—repression.
9381,state,"since other avenues for the expression of discontent—political parties, trade unions, an independent press, professional associations—were suppressed or strictly controlled, people flocked to mosques, where clerics used a religious vocabulary to preach barely disguised condemnations of the state and its policies."
9382,taken,"by 1977, for example, tehran’s “poetry nights” at the german-sponsored goethe institute had taken on a decidedly political color."

9390,law,"on friday, september 8, after martial law had been declared in the capital, dozens were killed in clashes between protesters and troops."
9391,freedom,"“black friday,” as it was instantly dubbed by the shah’s opponents, proved a watershed in the trajectory of the growing protest movement, which brought together varied political organizations and social classes: traditional and radical clerics, centrists from mossadegh’s old national front, communists of the tudeh party, as well as men and women associated with underground guerrilla movements, civil servants hurt by inflation and stagnant salaries, intellectuals eager for more freedom, and shopkeepers and bazaar merchants chafing at government attempts to control prices."
9392,power,"workers at tehran’s major electric power plant turned off the city’s electric supply at will, plunging the capital into darkness."
9393,law,i could not pick him up at the airport because martial law had been declared and a curfew was in force.
9394,charge,"no one at the airport seemed to be in charge at passport control or customs, he said."
9395,law,"troops patrolled the nearly deserted night streets, but they were lackadaisical in enforcing the rules of martial law."
9396,inside,"he seemed moved by the sense of calm and order inside the house, compared with the rising chaos on the streets."
9397,situation,"the regime, hammered by strikes, shutdowns, demonstrations, and violence on the streets, was in a hopeless situation."
9398,police,"ten days later, with the army having declared its “neutrality,” people in tehran rose up and overran government ministries, military barracks, police stations, and the radio and tv broadcasting centers."
9399,taken,the monarchy had collapsed; an islamic republic had taken its place.
9400,executed,"every day, grisly pictures appeared in the tehran papers of executed members of the old regime—many i had known personally or had covered as a journalist."

9403,where,"the kayhan organization, where shaul worked, had been seized by the revolutionary government."
9404,war,"polish by birth, she and her family had been rounded up by the soviet army in world war ii and sent to labor camps in russia."
9405,where,"somehow, the family made it overland to iran, then to lebanon, where she studied at the american university of beirut and met her future husband."
9406,interrogation,"the interrogation  mr. ja’fari had given me an address in affluent north tehran, off africa avenue."
9407,building,"i realized when i stepped out of my taxi that this was a building i knew, even though i had never been inside."
9408,industrial,"before the revolution, it had been the home of a member of one of iran’s leading industrial families."
9409,rehabilitation,"expropriated by the new regime after the islamic revolution, it had been used for a time as a rehabilitation center for prostitutes."
9410,interrogation,"rooms where the family had lived, raised children, and entertained their well-heeled guests were now a ministry of intelligence interrogation center."
9411,gate,"i went not to the main gate of the “petit trianon” but, as instructed, to a side door, which had perhaps served as the servants’ entrance in the old days."
9412,interrogation,"to his right, a closed door led to what turned out to be a series of interrogation rooms."
9413,locked,"i chose the brown sofa closest to the exit, despite knowing that the door was locked, and that i would leave only when they decided to let me go."
9414,case,"i recalled the persian saying: “your coming is in your hands, but your leaving is in the hands of god.” in my case, leaving was in the hands of the intelligence ministry’s agents."
9415,detention,"the building, i thought, must have its own detention facility."
9416,detention,"i had heard reports that the intelligence ministry, the revolutionary guards, the basij paramilitary forces, and shadowy vigilante groups maintained their own detention centers all over the city."
9417,inside,"he was soon summoned inside by a middle-aged man in a dark suit, sandals, and no tie."
9418,case,"through the now-open door behind the receptionist’s desk, i caught a glimpse of ja’fari, carrying his laptop case on his shoulder, moving toward an  interrogation room."
9419,case,"he was sitting behind a long desk; his laptop was already open before him and he was removing papers from an attaché case, which sat on the floor next to his chair."
9420,robbery,he asked me to tell him again what had happened on the night of the robbery.
9421,robbery,how can such a thing happen on the road to the airport?” i had by now reluctantly concluded that agents of the intelligence ministry had staged the “robbery.” ja’fari’s summons had hardened my gnawing suspicion into certainty.
9422,where,“where you live is of no importance.
9423,law,"we don’t have first- and second-class citizens in the islamic republic.” the law, he noted, says an iranian has to wait six months to replace a lost or stolen passport."
9424,police,"“that is how long it will take.” as to my belongings, he referred me, as he had done before, to the agahi, the detective branch of the national police."
9425,question,"with the formalities over, ja’fari began to question me in detail about my career in iran before the revolution, including my years with kayhan (this once relatively liberal newspaper had become the organ of the most hard-line elements in the islamic republic and a mouthpiece for the security services), with the women’s organization of iran, and with the shahbanou farah foundation."
9426,court,"“oh, so you worked for the royal court,” ja’fari remarked with his usual smirk."
9427,arrested,the previous summer a number of prominent female activists had been arrested during a demonstration demanding broader rights for women.
9428,trial,they had been charged and were awaiting trial.
9429,authority,"invariably courteous and considerate, he exercised authority quietly but firmly."
9430,interrogation,he leaned back in his chair as he always did when he imagined he had reached a turning point in the interrogation.
9431,case,"tell us about the hidden layers.” with alarm, i began to see the shape of ja’fari’s fantasies and the case he was trying to build against me."
9432,interrogation,he made me sign the bottom of each of his interrogation sheets and each of my answers.
9433,interrogation,the interrogation will continue every day for the rest of the week.” i collected my coat and the book i had brought with me and walked out.
9434,interrogation,"i was drained and exhausted from seven hours of interrogation, the tension, and the tedious back-and-forth."
9435,taken,my hand ached from hours of writing; the cramped position in which i had to sit and write had taken its toll on my back.
9436,case,i wanted her to know i was leaving in case i met with another “accident” on my way home.
9437,interrogation,the interrogation was taking a frightening turn.
9438,interrogation,"“smooth and horrible” from my mother’s apartment, i e-mailed shaul about the interrogation."
9439,evin,"“i see myself in that horrible place,” i wrote, picturing evin prison."
9440,case,"“no one,” he was told, “can tell these people to lay off.” it was urgent that we stop ja’fari before they had fabricated a serious case against me, yet our friends and acquaintances in tehran were academics: university professors, researchers, members of think tanks."
9441,taken,"they had given talks at the wilson center and other washington institutions, spent time at american universities, or taken part in track ii diplomacy—meetings between nongovernment iranians and americans."
9442,power,"they had little influence and no power, but they knew people in the government who we hoped might in turn know people in the security services."
9443,interrogation,"while shaul placed calls in washington, i telephoned nasser, a good friend and a tehran university professor, and described the worrisome direction the interrogation was taking."
9444,where,"on the contrary, as hostility toward iran was widespread in official circles in the united states, and proponents of overthrowing the iranian regime became plentiful, the wilson center at least provided a forum where a variety of views on iran could be heard, including the views of scholars, civil society activists, and journalists from the islamic republic."
9445,authorities,"we were also hoping that javad zarif, the iranian ambassador to the united nations in new york, who was acquainted with me and the wilson center, would weigh in with the authorities in tehran."
9446,interrogation,the interrogation had to take its course.
9447,interrogation,"in the two weeks following my initial encounter with ja’fari, i returned nearly every day for interrogation at the “petit trianon.” these sessions could last nine or ten hours; occasionally ja’fari stopped after three or four."
9448,interrogation,"on top of each page, the words “interrogation sheet” and a file number appeared in persian."
9449,question,ja’fari would write down his question; i would write down my cryptic reply.
9450,question,"ja’fari would read each answer, write down another question, and hand the sheet of paper back to me."
9451,cell,"while i wrote, ja’fari fiddled with his cell phone or with the tape recorder that he sometimes brought with him; he sipped at the tea which the tea boy brought him several times a day."
9452,cell,"sometimes, he stepped outside briefly to take a call on his cell phone."
9453,interrogation,"while ja’fari lunched, i remained alone in the interrogation room, mentally going over the ground we had covered, revisiting the questions and answers, anxious lest he pick on a stray fact or an innocent remark and use it to accuse me of some subversive activity."
9454,interrogation,"“we will go over every single meeting your program held,” he told me, and i envisioned—accurately as it turned out—days and days of interrogation regarding meetings at the wilson center going back many years, whose details i could not possibly remember."
9455,sentences,"from a long lecture on iran’s economy, he would zero in on a few sentences critical of iran’s economic policy, highlight them, and then instruct me to read these sentences, and only these sentences, into the interrogation record."
9456,charges,"ja’fari was taken aback, but this did not prevent him from reverting to similar charges later in the interrogation."
9457,state,"who comes from the state department and the defense department?” except in a general sense, i really had no idea who came to our meetings."
9458,where,you haven’t told me your real name; and i still don’t know where you work.” ja’fari was not amused.
9459,institution,"ja’fari was interested in the other institutions with which we had cooperated, including the hoover institution at stanford and the center for international studies at m.i.t."
9460,sentence,"“they are planning a show trial, a ‘confession,’ and a jail sentence,” i e-mailed shaul on january 13."
9461,trial,"“they won’t dare put you on trial,” he said, but i wasn’t convinced."
9462,charge,it was the “receptionist”—who i now concluded was actually in charge—who met and spoke to me.
9463,interrogation,“the interrogation is over.
9464,inside,"go to the passport office and get your passport.” i could barely suppress the sense of relief, the excitement, that was welling up inside me."
9465,question,"naturally, the first question my relatives put to me was “when are you leaving?” i thought i would be gone in a week, but not wanting to jinx things, i noted that it ordinarily takes six months to issue a new passport."
9466,police,"it was here that women’s rights demonstrators had been attacked, beaten, and hauled off in police vans earlier in the summer."
9467,police,"on this friday, the morals police, always on the lookout for young girls showing hair beneath their scarves or young men and women fraternizing, were out among the crowds, but they seemed inclined to leave people alone."
9468,arrest,"like me, she thought they had come to arrest me."
9469,ordered,"“cover your hair,” one of them ordered."
9470,building,"the building caretaker stood at the door, anxiously peering in."
9471,inside,"when my mother answered the doorbell, one of the men had stuck his foot inside the door to prevent her from closing it."
9472,warrant,"back in the living room, the team leader showed me a search warrant."
9473,cell,"this done, he dialed a number on his cell phone and mumbled something into it."
9474,court,to ja’fari the invitation was no doubt damning evidence of connections to the royal court.
9475,situation,"i laughed, despite the gravity of the situation."
9476,jail,"i was scared, of course; they might cart me off to jail."
9477,case,the change of venue was deeply disturbing; it signaled a ratcheting up of my interrogation and my case.
9478,war,"friends who knew something about the workings of the intelligence community told me that at the senior levels of the intelligence ministry, two factions were engaged in a tug-of-war over policy—and over me."
9479,interrogation,"the interrogation, therefore, should continue until i talked."
9480,interrogation,"the moderate faction had prevailed on the previous wednesday, when i had been told at the “passport office” that my interrogation was over and that i was free to go."
9481,national security,"one schoolboy friend of president ahmadinejad’s who had vouched for me through his contacts in the national security council and the foreign ministry even received a message from the president: “tell him to stop beating the drum of the americans,” he was told."
9482,building,"at the intelligence ministry the intelligence ministry had located itself in the building that used to serve as the headquarters of savak, the secret police under the monarchy."
9483,building,"it was a nondescript hulk of a building, off khajeh abdol-lah ansari avenue, in a lower-middle-class district in the eastern part of the city."
9484,building,"i got out from my taxi a few blocks from the building, a practice i followed each day over the next several weeks, whether i came by cab or a friend drove me."
9485,police,"such precautions, i discovered, become second nature when you are entangled with the secret police."
9486,poverty,the great ruins at persepolis had made me proud; the poverty in zahedan had made me weep.
9487,interrogation,"i followed him to a tiny, windowless room; there was a desk and chair for the interrogator and a combination chair and desk, the kind seen in schoolrooms, for the person under interrogation."
9488,where,i could have touched both walls from where i was standing.
9489,state,"in my morbid state of mind, i thought of the canadian-iranian journalist, zahra kazemi, who had died under interrogation four years earlier in evin prison at the hands of these same people."
9490,case,her case made world headlines.
9491,term,"the second stage is takhliyyehye ettela’at, a term which in persian has a much more sinister meaning than “debriefing,” the term from which it presumably derived."
9492,war,"we had cosponsored three meetings on iran with the hoover institution at stanford university; these too became a focus of ja’fari’s attention, as did a series of meetings we held on the iran-iraq war, part of a larger cold war project that was examining the korean war, the cuban missile crisis, and other conflicts, using archival material and bringing together some of the original key players."
9493,interrogation,but shaul could not appreciate the relentless pressure i was under in the interrogation room.
9494,imprisonment,"i was facing the possibility of formal charges, imprisonment, and trial."
9495,police,"like some manic agent of the soviet secret police or the east german stasi, he was intent on amassing detailed information, no matter how insignificant, on every iranian i had ever known."
9496,exercise,i took ja’fari’s questions one by one and wrote my replies bent down on the low table in front of me—an exercise that was playing havoc on my back.
9497,cell,"ja’fari, in the meantime, swiveled left and right in his chair and fiddled with his cell phone, which seemed to be ringing all the time."
9498,question,"he would ask me the same question again and again, sometimes days apart, hoping to catch me in an inconsistency or to wear me down."
9499,evin,"“we can make life difficult for you.” he claimed the intelligence ministry was in possession of incriminating documents against me, so sensitive that “we will show them to you in another place,” clearly implying evin prison, where “you won’t be free to come and go as you do now.” repeatedly, he reminded me that no one could help me."
9500,state,“how often does hamilton go to congress and the state department to get his orders and pass them on to you?” his other technique was to quote selectively and out of context and to twist the meaning of what i or others had said or written.
9501,sentence,one day he triumphantly produced a sentence from  the blurb on the back cover of my book reconstructed lives: women and iran’s islamic revolution.
9502,sentence,"the sentence read, “she and her informants describe strategies by which women try and sometimes succeed in subverting the state’s agenda.” the words conjured up all kinds of nefarious plots in ja’fari’s head."
9503,sentence,"he had underlined the last sentence of my remarks, in which i said the invasion of iraq had “a sobering effect” on many iranians."
9504,sentence,"i concluded that “most iranians would prefer talks with the united states over confrontation, on the one hand, or a u.s.-led regime change on the other.” he didn’t understand the structure of the sentence, and it drove him into a paroxysm of accusatory fury."
9505,arrested,"when i was forced to report to the intelligence ministry, i was told ja’fari was finishing up, that while i was clearly being harassed, i would never be arrested."
9506,building,"but i now realized ja’fari was building a case against me, not winding down."
9507,sentence,"“they are planning a show trial, confession, and a jail sentence,” i e-mailed him in january."
9508,building,again in early february i wrote: “you are not aware how they are building a case against me….
9509,court,"my gut feeling is the next step is evin [prison], incarceration, and appearing in court.” shaul and i still stuck to the strategy of avoiding press coverage, publicity, or any statement about me by the wilson center, which we were convinced would backfire, bringing even harsher treatment from the hard-liners, but it was proving difficult."
9510,exercise,this was not an idle exercise on my part.
9511,trial,ja’fari had threatened to put me on trial.
9512,charges,"as i e-mailed shaul on february 12, ja’fari was laying the groundwork for charges against me."
9513,case,"i struggled to recall events going back five, sometimes ten and twenty years, in case ja’fari asked."
9514,interrogation,"each evening i carefully went over in my mind the course of the day’s interrogation, trying to discern where ja’fari was headed and what traps he had laid for me, and making sure i had not inadvertently slipped up somewhere."
9515,interrogation,there was no point in adding grist for his interrogation mill.
9516,sentences,"ja’fari would underline sentences in the text of remarks i had made or talks others had given at the wilson center and ask me to read these, out of context, into the record."
9517,sentences,"i always made sure to copy down the longer passage in which these sentences were embedded in order to provide context, to show there was balance in the presentations."
9518,power,"ja’fari was also familiar with the names of some leading political theorists, such as crane brinton and theda skocpol on revolution, francis fukuyama on the so-called end of history and the emergence of democratic polities, and michel foucault on forms of western hegemony and the hegemonic power of various forms of discourse."
9519,officers,iran’s intelligence officers seemed to share these suppositions.
9520,interrogation,"he wanted to discuss these ideas and thinkers with me, either to show that he too was a well-read intellectual, or in order to lead the discussion back to the subject of my interrogation: what the united states planned to do in iran, how i envisioned iran’s future, how i thought political systems evolve, and where my political preferences and inclinations lay."
9521,charge,i had no interest in getting involved in a discussion of abstract issues with secret police interrogators; and i did not want ja’fari and his colleagues to twist something i might say on politics in general into another charge against me.
9522,evin,"recalling the interrogation he had conducted the previous year of ramin jahanbegloo, the iranian political philosopher who in 2006 had spent four months in evin prison, he spat, “we used to ask mr. jahanbegloo one question, and he wrote seventy pages."
9523,interrogation,"we ask you a question and you hardly write seven lines!” hizbollywood amid the grim and grueling interrogation sessions, i had my moments of amusement."
9524,where,"he also asked me to tell him about the council on foreign relations, “where american foreign policy is made.” the cfr brings together prominent american academics, journalists, officials, and former officials for a discussion of foreign-policy issues."
9525,where,"it is a weighty organization, but it is not a secret sanctum where official u.s. policy is determined."
9526,war,"one morning ja’fari confronted me with a talk given at the wilson center by a lebaneseamerican scholar, marwan kraidy, titled “hizbollywood: hizbollah’s information war viewed from lebanon.” marwan was making a play on words, combining hizbollah, the lebanese shi’ite opposition group supported by iran, with bollywood, the term for the highly successful indian film industry, based in mumbai."
9527,charge,"to rebut the charge that the wilson center was complicit with the u.s. government in trying to undermine the islamic republic, i pointed out that lee hamilton was coauthor of the iraq study group report."
9528,inside,"ja’fari dismissed this inconvenient fact with a wave of his hand: “the recommendations are a sham,” he said, “just a ploy to gain a foothold inside iran.” hajj agha despairing of getting me to “cooperate,” ja’fari also tried handing me over to his senior officer, hajj agha, who was presumably better qualified to get me to talk."
9529,interrogation,my first conversation took place during the earliest days of my interrogation at the intelligence ministry headquarters.
9530,cell,ja’fari dialed a number on his cell phone and handed the phone to me.
9531,situation,"in that first conversation, he tried to impress on me the seriousness of my situation and to disabuse me of the idea that anyone could intercede on my behalf."
9532,interrogation,my second telephone conversation with hajj agha—he never showed up in person—took place near the very end of the intelligence ministry phase of my interrogation.
9533,cell,once again ja’fari dialed his cell phone and handed it to me.
9534,where,where are the angels?
9535,charged,"you face death twenty times a day, driving a cab in this traffic, in your home, or coming face-to-face with the revolutionary guards, the morals police, or the basij [the paramilitary forces that are charged with maintaining public order and also enforce public morality]."
9536,question,no grounds for complaint my mother opened the door with her usual question.
9537,arrested,she had survived the raid on her apartment; but i did not know how much longer she could bear the fear and anxiety or what would happen to her if i were arrested.
9538,arrested,"farideh had even spent a couple of nights in prison, when she was arrested while observing a women’s rights demonstration in which she was not taking part."
9539,arrest,we will produce documents and show them to you where you will not be free to come and go.” “do you mean you will arrest me?” i asked.
9540,arrest,i feared a sudden arrest and show trial on false charges.
9541,imprisonment,i feared imprisonment at evin.
9542,arrest,"“they will never dare arrest you,” he told me on the phone and added in an early-february e-mail: “i know that you are tired; but you have been magnificent in handling this, including the interrogations."
9543,robbery,but nothing i had done during my weeklong visit prior to the “robbery” had been even slightly out of the ordinary.
9544,power,"power was fragmented, and various agencies—the regular government, the revolutionary council, the revolutionary committees, the revolutionary courts, khomeini’s lieutenants, clerics in the provinces—vied for power."
9545,power,"a fierce power struggle erupted, first between khomeini’s men and their rivals for political power, such as the old national front and radical left-wing movements, then among khomeini’s own lieutenants."
9546,prisons,"when his supporters took to the streets, pitched battles ensued and thousands were killed, many executed in prisons, but others executed on the streets, in full public view."
9547,war,"in the eight-year war that ensued, much of southern iran was devastated, leaving the cities of khorramshahr and abadan, where i had spent a part of my childhood, and towns along the border in partial or total ruin."
9548,war,refugees from the war zone flocked to cities farther north.
9549,war,"in 1985 “the war of the cities” began, as saddam hussein rained down missiles on tehran and some thirty other urban centers."
9550,war,the iran-iraq war had ended in 1988.
9551,authority,"khamenei lacked khomeini’s immense prestige, scholarly standing, and charisma; but the constitution vests ultimate authority and vast powers in the supreme leader."
9552,exercise,khamenei gradually came to exercise these powers in his own right.
9553,state,he took steps to reduce state involvement in the economy and to encourage the private sector.
9554,pen,the intellectually restless were using pen and speech to push against the parameters of the permissible.
9555,where,my parents still lived in the same house where i had grown up.
9556,police,"on the streets, young women, beginning to show a bit of hair, daring to wear tighter clothes and some makeup, seemed self-confident, uncowed by the morals police; and they were visible everywhere: in the workplace, on university campuses, hiking in the hills above tehran, in cafes and restaurants."
9557,taken,"i attended a university class with the literature professor azar nafisi, and another class with the sociologist changiz pahlavan, and was taken with the articulateness of their young students, their familiarity with western literature and sociopolitical concepts, their eagerness to learn and explore new ideas, their easy interaction with their professors."
9558,lawyer,"mehrangiz kar, whom i knew from my work at the women’s organization before the revolution, was a lawyer."

9561,police,"the hard-liners, who opposed easing up on press and political restrictions and argued for a crackdown on the reformers, had retained control of the instruments of repression: the security services, the secret police, the revolutionary guards, and the judiciary."
9562,arrest,"they used these instruments to close reformist newspapers, arrest journalists, clamp down on university students, tamper with elections, and block legislation to free up the press or uphold constitutionally mandated liberties."

9582,death,"at the time of his death in 2005, karim was one of iran’s foremost lexicographers, editors, and translators."
9583,death,just before his death he had completed work on a onevolume persian-dictionary.

9590,police,i often witnessed the morals police stopping young boys and girls on the streets and hauling them away.
9591,freedom,"the sense of excitement, the possibility of freedom i had sensed in the early years of the khatami presidency were gone."

9596,lawyer,every day has been a wonderful experience for me.” there was also the now-vital precaution of getting a lawyer.
9597,arrest,"persistent, outspoken, feisty, and enjoying a degree of immunity from arrest due to her high international profile, she was not popular with the intelligence ministry or the revolutionary courts."
9598,case,"i knew her and admired her down-to-earth, plainspoken style, but i still hesitated to ask her to take my case."
9599,court,she had made a name for herself defending high-profile political dissidents in court.
9600,trial,i had not been arrested or put on trial—yet.
9601,court,"my retaining a lawyer like ebadi might force the ministry’s hand, giving it even more incentive to manufacture a case against me and ram it through the court system."
9602,state,"by taking her as my lawyer, i might have alerted some of the foreign press, which we had thus far so carefully avoided as well as the u.s. state department or prominent american officials."
9603,law,i got off several blocks away from the law office and walked in and out of several stores.
9604,building,"once at the lawyer’s building, i pushed the elevator button for the wrong floor, then took the stairs to her office."

9611,robbery,a few days after the robbery i had gone to the swiss embassy in tehran to report the theft and request a new passport.

9613,state,"joseph gildenhorn, the chairman of the board of the wilson center, spoke to former secretary of state colin powell, who called the state department."
9614,state,"the wilson center found in its files a stock photograph that could be cropped to serve as a passport photo, and the state department  arranged for a passport to be issued in record time."

9618,war,"during the cold war, the shah relied on the united states to support him against what appeared to be a threatening soviet union, with its 1,200-mile shared border with iran, its historical designs on iranian territory, and its communist ideology."
9619,war,"for the united states, the shah was an ally against the soviet union during the cold war, a partner in ensuring persian gulf security in the 1970s, and a reliable source of oil."
9620,industrial,iran provided a substantial market for american weaponry and industrial and commercial goods.
9621,power,"america provided him with great power patronage, access to weaponry and technology, diplomatic support, and, when he needed it, an additional level of security."
9622,power,"but the shah never overcame the stigma of having been restored to power in 1953 in a cia-engineered coup, and with segments of the iranian population, the alliance with the united states was not popular."
9623,power,"in this clutch of arab states, military officers embracing a heady ideology of arab and pan-arab nationalism and socialism came to power."
9624,arrest,"in 1963, he chose one of the holiest mourning days in shi’ite islam to preach a sermon harshly critical of the shah’s policies and his close relations with israel, warning the shah that the people would “throw you out of iran.” his arrest led to severe riots in tehran and other cities."
9625,killing,he and his supporters noted that america stood by the shah even as his troops were killing protesters on the streets of iranian cities.
9626,national security,"on november 4, 1979, just days after bazargan met with u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski in algiers, students from tehran’s universities seized the american embassy in tehran and took more than sixty diplomats hostage."
9627,power,"it gave the faltering revolution a new lease on life, strengthened the radicals, and weakened the moderates in the internal struggle for power."
9628,incarceration,but fifty-two americans spent 444 days in the embassy and makeshift places of incarceration.
9629,war,"but when the tide of the war turned in iran’s favor and the iraqi regime appeared threatened, the reagan administration tilted toward iraq."
9630,war,"at one point during the war, the united states had information that iraq was using chemical weapons on “a daily basis” against iranian troops, yet donald rumsfeld was dispatched to baghdad in december 1983 to lay the grounds for resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries."
9631,war,"the war inflicted enormous physical damage on iran, cost over 200,000 lives, and left deep scars on the iranian psyche."

9634,war,iran badly needed arms for its war with iraq.
9635,taken,"but, as an indication that the iranians and lebanese were feuding among themselves, only a few hostages were released while additional ones were taken."
9636,war,"the arms deliveries abruptly stopped, and the reagan administration reverted to a policy of steady support for the iraqi war effort."
9637,war,"a “quid without the ‘quo’”: bush i the end of the iran-iraq war in 1988—when both countries, exhausted by a conflict neither could win, accepted a cease-fire in place—and the election as president of george h. w. bush in the united states and of hashemi-rafsanjani in iran the following year appeared to provide the opportunity for some understanding between the two countries."
9638,war,"it did not join the coalition, but it did not obstruct the war effort, either."
9639,war,"in exchange for an american-sponsored security council resolution finally recognizing iraq as the aggressor in the iran-iraq war, iran secured the release of the remaining american hostages in lebanon."
9640,law,"in the following year, he signed into law the iran-libya sanctions act (ilsa)."
9641,law,"the law, principally the brainchild of senator alphonse d’amato of new york, penalized any country that invested more than $40 million (later lowered to $20 million) in iran’s or libya’s energy industry."
9642,law,"the law allowed for a presidential waiver, which clinton often used; it probably was illegal under world trade organization (wto) rules, and european and other states bristled at the suggestion that america would dictate trade policy to them."
9643,killing,"hizbollah fired rockets into northern israel, and in february 1996 hamas and pij carried out four bombings in israel in nine days, killing 59 israelis."
9644,state,"since arafat was already committed to a two-state solution, this was a far cry from iran’s call for the destruction of israel."
9645,wall,"in january 1998, in an interview on cnn, khatami called for a dialogue between the people of iran and the people of the united states to remove the “wall of mistrust” between them, and for an exchange of writers, artists, journalists, academics, and tourists."
9646,state,"in a june 1998 speech, secretary of state madeleine albright had already invited iran to join the united states in drawing up “a road map leading to normal relations.” in a major speech in march 2000, she renewed this offer and, in a gesture thought to be important to the iranians, expressed regret for the american role in the overthrow of mossadegh in 1953."
9647,sentence,"but the speech also noted that in iran “control over the military, courts, and police remain in unelected hands.” that sentence caused offense to iran’s supreme leader, khamenei."
9648,power,"america was the stronger power, and he did not want to negotiate from a position of weakness."
9649,state,"he knew that in negotiations he would have to compromise on issues central to his regional policy, such as iran’s unflinching hostility to the state of israel."
9650,term,this was illustrated during bush’s first term by the response to an iranian proposal for what some observers described as a “grand bargain” between the two countries.
9651,war,iran quietly assisted the american war in afghanistan and was instrumental in helping the united states put together an interim government to run the country after the fall of the taliban in 2001.
9652,authority,"in january 2002, the israelis captured a ship, the karine a, which they said was carrying iranian arms for the palestinian authority."
9653,state,"in his state of the union address later that month, president bush included iran, along with iraq and north korea, in what he described as “an axis of evil.” his remarks undercut moderates in tehran who had argued that cooperation with the united states in afghanistan would be reciprocated by washington."
9654,power,iran’s protégés were now in power.
9655,roads,"as order broke down and chaos ensued in postwar iraq, iran sent in agents, funded iraqi political parties and militias, built schools and roads, and invested in social welfare projects."
9656,power,the united states and iran were soon locked in a struggle for power and influence in iraq.
9657,taken,"in regard to iran, the president repeatedly said, “all options are on the table.” this threat, taken to mean air strikes against iran’s nuclear facilities, created uncertainty about ultimate american intentions and only deepened iranian skepticism about the utility of talks."
9658,war,"after the fall of saddam hussein, having discovered no nuclear weapons in iraq—the original reason for invading the country—the administration increasingly cited democratization in iraq and sweeping democratization across the middle east as a rationale for the war."
9659,state,"in 2005, the state department announced the allocation of funds to this end, and invited applications from groups and individuals working to advance democracy in iran."
9660,state,but the state department asked congress for $75 million for democracy promotion in iran the next year; congress offered up to $66 million.
9661,power,"in his january 2005 inaugural address, president bush said, “america will…support democratic movements in the middle east and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world,” and, directly addressing the iranian people, added, “as you stand for your own liberty, america stands with you.” on the eve of the iranian presidential elections in june, he issued a statement noting that “today iran is ruled by men who suppress liberty at home and spread terror across the world,” and said that an “unelected few” held power in iran through “an electoral process that ignores the basic requirements of democracy.” there was not the remotest possibility that any significant ngo, publication, association, or political organization in iran would risk accepting american government money, anyway."
9662,power,"shirin ebadi noted that the democracy fund had “created immense problems for iranian reformists, democratic groups, and human rights activists” and had made it “more difficult for the more moderate factions in iran’s power hierarchy to argue for an accommodation with the west.” echoing the same views, the dissident journalist emadeddin baghi described a policy of promoting regime change by trying to give money to dissidents as “neither wise nor morally justifiable.” at the wilson center, almost every speaker from iran criticized the “democracy promotion” funding as ineffective and unwelcome to iran’s political activists and ngos."
9663,detention,"it was fueled by long-standing animosity between tehran and washington, an ineffective and ultimately harmful program of democracy promotion that contributed to my detention and that of many others, and an iron determination by iran’s security services to squash all american plans regarding the islamic republic."
9664,arrest,"the arrest  on may 2, the lull finally ended."
9665,inside,"what they wanted from me was not the “old stuff’ but “the plan,” “the program” for the future, alluding to what the intelligence ministry still clearly believed was an american blueprint for regime change in iran, about which they presumed i had inside information."
9666,arrest,"if they had wanted to arrest you, he reassured me, they had had ample opportunity to do so."
9667,power,"i knew he would do everything in his power to get me out of this predicament, but now he was far away."
9668,evin,“i will visit you at evin and bring you lots of parcels.” i hadn’t been in this grim neighborhood for nearly three months.
9669,building,"inside the building, the security belt still was not working."
9670,arrest,"he said, “this is your arrest warrant and we are taking you to evin.” i was stunned."
9671,evin,evin prison had a fearsome reputation.
9672,prisoners,it had been built under the monarchy to house both political and ordinary prisoners.
9673,incarcerated,"after the islamic revolution, the thousands of officials of the old regime swept up in the first wave of arrests were incarcerated here, soon to be joined by thousands more arrested in the factional infighting that followed."
9674,executed,men and women had been executed here following midnight trials before hooded judges.
9675,torture,torture to extract information was common.
9676,prisoners,"the notorious warden of evin prison, asadollah lajevardi, had instituted ideological “reeducation” classes for prisoners from left-wing guerrilla organizations, demanding public recantations of their previously held beliefs."
9677,inmates,"it was at evin and a second prison that some 2,000 inmates were murdered in 1988 in an extended “night of the long knives.” i asked to call my mother."
9678,evin,they are taking me to evin.
9679,lawyer,notify my family and get me a lawyer.” i said good-bye to mutti and walked with ja’fari to the front door.
9680,torture,"i tried not to think of what they might do to me: would i be subjected to torture, beatings, verbal abuse, humiliation?"
9681,evin,"after an hour, the high walls of evin prison rose before us."
9682,building,two large iron doors swung open; guards peered into the car and waved us through; the car drove into the courtyard and stopped before the door of a building.
9683,wall,"here, i was handed over to a man in wrinkled gray trousers and a checkered shirt who took me inside and told me to stand facing the wall."
9684,wall,"i joined others already there, all men, each of us standing barely six inches from the wall in the narrow corridor, staring at nothing."
9685,building,she took me by the hand and walked me through the building.
9686,guard,"you are dependent on others to navigate the unfamiliar corridors and stairways, hanging on to the guard as if you were a helpless child."
9687,evin,the process of booking me into evin was under way.
9688,evin,"blindly into evin our first stop was a small office, where a man with a bored look took down my particulars— name, family name, age, place of birth."
9689,ward,we stopped at what appeared to be a door—the entrance to ward 209.
9690,guard,"i could hear the guard ring a doorbell, push open the door, then pull back a curtain."
9691,inside,we stepped inside.
9692,guard,the guard told me to remove the blindfold.
9693,cell,"i was standing in a corridor roughly fifty feet long and barely five feet wide, with windows on my right and iron cell doors, painted white, on my left."
9694,guard,"the guard walked me to the last of the doors, which was open."
9695,cell,this was the entrance to my cell.
9696,where,"the walls were painted a greenish yellow, with patches of white where the paint had peeled off."
9697,wall,against one wall stood a dirty iron sink.
9698,wall,"well-worn, brown, wall-to-wall carpet covered the floor."
9699,toilet,there was no bed or toilet.
9700,prisoners,"they were open to let in fresh air, screened to keep out flies, and barred to keep in prisoners."
9701,inside,a female guard with disheveled hair and a wrinkled shirt and skirt came to tell me shoes were not allowed inside the cells (which i ignored) and to admonish me not to “sit or sleep with your feet stretched toward the quran.” later she brought me lunch—a plastic container of rice and stew and a plastic spoon.
9702,prisoner,"the chubby-faced guard came by with a hand towel, a bar of soap, a toothbrush, and toothpaste—the standard toilet kit for every prisoner—and later with a chador, which she asked me to please wear whenever i was summoned out of the cell."
9703,inmates,she showed me the location of the inmates’ bathroom and an outdoor terrace where prisoners were allowed for air one hour each day.
9704,facility,"each time i wanted to use the bathroom, i had to knock on the door and be escorted to the facility and then escorted back."
9705,interrogation,"ja’fari showed up that very afternoon and subjected me to a lengthy and angry interrogation, which lasted into the late evening."
9706,evin,"i had not cooperated, he said, and i was therefore brought to evin."
9707,cell,"back in my cell many hours later, i felt drained and exhausted."
9708,cell,"every hour or so, i heard the clip-clopping of the night guard’s slippers on the concrete floor of the corridor, as she checked on me and the other inmates through the little opening in the cell doors."
9709,wall,"through the window bars high up on the wall, i could see the stars in the tehran sky."
9710,cell,i sat up and took in the reality of my prison cell.
9711,guard,"at six in the morning the guard with disheveled hair—i had dubbed her sour face— showed up with a cup of tea, a piece of bread, and a slice of cheese which she carried in her bare hands."
9712,cell,"an hour later, a young guard whom i nicknamed rashti because her accent told me she was a northerner from rasht, came to the cell door and offered me a breakfast of milk, tea, bread, butter, honey, jam, and cheese."
9713,evin,"i was still too upset to eat; but tea, a slice of bread, and cream cheese became my standard evin breakfast."
9714,interrogation,"i was summoned for a second interrogation session soon after breakfast, this time with both ja’fari and hajj agha."
9715,guard,"in the afternoon, a middle-aged guard whom everyone referred to as hajj khanum told me to put on my chador and blindfold and follow her."
9716,court,i was to appear before a revolutionary court magistrate.
9717,court,"the revolutionary court we went down two flights and out of the building, where i was told to remove my blindfold and step into a nissan suv the driver and another man, a guard, sat in the front."
9718,inmate,one seat farther back was a male inmate in a prison uniform sitting next to a guard.
9719,evin,"i hoped for an accident—an everyday occurrence in tehran’s mad traffic—and a broken arm or leg, so that i would end up in a hospital rather than back in evin."
9720,court,"we went up shariati avenue, turned into moallem avenue, and stopped in front of the large building housing the revolutionary court."
9721,guard,all five of us got out and we followed the driver and guard through a large courtyard and up to the eighth floor.
9722,inmate,the other inmate fetched me a chair and a cup of water.
9723,detention,"i read that i was accused of “endangering national security” and that the magistrate had ordered a one-week detention and set bail at 30 million tomans, or about $30,000."
9724,charged,i did not even have the presence of mind to ask why i was charged—nor would it have made the slightest difference had i done so.
9725,guard,"we drove back in the suv the driver and the guard in the backseat were idly chatting, and i wondered how they could talk so casually while my world was falling apart."
9726,evin,we stopped once again at the looming iron gates of evin.
9727,court,a similar scene had played out at the revolutionary court only an hour earlier.
9728,ward,"inside, we were once again lined up, facing a wall, and i waited until a prison guard came and took me, groping in my blindfold, back to ward 209."
9729,bail,"half believing i might be able to get out on bail, i asked her to find some way of raising the 30  million tomans."
9730,evin,"mother said she had come to evin for the second time that morning and with some difficulty had been able to leave a package of food, clothes, and medicine at the gate."
9731,evin,"when she had come on my first day at evin, she had been told i was not there."
9732,court,"the next day, when i saw ja’fari, i spoke angrily to him about my treatment—the appearance before a revolutionary court magistrate, the absurd accusations against me."
9733,gate,i also complained of the way my mother had been treated at the prison gate.
9734,authorities,he reluctantly agreed to speak to the prison authorities.
9735,guard,the magistrate as superman it must have been around nine that evening when the guard i had nicknamed sour face announced a visitor.
9736,inmate,who would call on an inmate at night?
9737,wall,"three flights of stairs later, my blindfold off, i found myself in a large room, like the living room of a middle-class family: there were easy chairs and low tables and a glass bookcase against the wall."
9738,cell,"to sour face’s horror, i removed the chador i had put on before leaving my cell and sat in the chair nearest to him in only my robe and scarf."
9739,charge,matin-rassekh introduced himself as the prosecuting magistrate in charge of my case.
9740,court,"he was not in the day before, when i was first brought before the revolutionary court, he explained."
9741,punishment,"do you know what the punishment is?” i knew, of course."
9742,law,"under strict islamic law, a muslim woman who marries a non-muslim is considered to have committed adultery."
9743,punishment,the punishment is death by stoning.
9744,question,he also asked why our daughter was named after me—a curious question perhaps meant to single us out as people who broke all sorts of traditions.
9745,taken,"at one point, hajj khanum relieved sour face, who had been visibly taken aback when matin-rassekh spoke of my husband’s religion."
9746,ward,i later learned sour face raced back to the ward and told the other guards on duty the scandalous news that “she is married to a jew!
9747,evin,"she committed zena-ye mohseneh—adultery!” matin-rassekh, with an office in evin prison, worked particularly closely with the intelligence ministry."
9748,detention,"he had taken charge of my case for obvious reasons: the first  magistrate seemed to grasp the thinness of the case against me, and consequently issued a short detention order and set “reasonable” bail by iranian standards."
9749,bail,"clearly, bail implied the possibility of release."
9750,sentences,"on the contrary, i could easily imagine him signing death sentences in the afternoon, saying his prayers in the early evening, and comfortably having dinner with his wife and children at night."
9751,national security,"i was accused, he noted, of plotting against and endangering national security."
9752,detention,"he was issuing an order for my detention in solitary confinement for three months “to prevent [my] escape from the country.” i had mentally prepared myself for such a detention order, which was common in political cases, but anticipation is never the same as the reality."
9753,confinement,"i reread the single sheet of paper and its key sentences: “accused of plotting against national security…three months in solitary confinement.” they still came as a shock, like hammer blows on an anvil."
9754,charges,"i have no intention of running away, because all these charges are fabrications and false, and i will fight them.” matin-rassekh must have taken note of my ashen face."
9755,cell,"i was reading when a guard showed up at my cell door and told me to get ready for a “visitor.” when i expressed annoyance that matin-rassekh came at such a late hour, the guard said, “this is not late."
9756,lawyer,"it said, in effect, “i, haleh esfandiari, waive the right to have a lawyer.” inwardly, i felt a little emboldened, a bit triumphant."
9757,arrested,"i had told shaul that, if arrested, he should proceed immediately with the idea of having shirin ebadi as my lawyer."
9758,case,i knew shaul would do everything to persuade her to take my case.
9759,case,"this sheet of paper, i concluded, meant shirin was now representing me and they wanted her off my case."
9760,lawyer,"“if my family decided i need a lawyer, then i need a lawyer."
9761,lawyer,i took the sheet from matin-rassekh and wrote on it: “i waive the right to a lawyer only for the next three days.
9762,authority,"after that the lawyer hired by my family has the authority to represent me.” if they were fearful of the publicity shirin ebadi would create in the international community, i had given them an opening, three days in which to release me."
9763,lawyer,"he followed our advice and refused a lawyer.” i shot back, “you people are accusing me of plotting to overthrow the regime and expect me not to have a lawyer?” kian tajbakhsh was the iranian american academic who was a consultant to george soros’s open society institute and about whom i had been questioned."
9764,evin,he was also being held at evin.
9765,taken,matin-rassekh had prepared a single document for both of us and had taken it to kian first.
9766,question,his question was a mere formality.
9767,interrogation,"the next day, at an interrogation session, i told ja’fari and hajj agha about the nighttime visit."
9768,cell,"“i don’t want that man swooping down on my cell unannounced like superman anymore,” i said."
9769,police,"the rise of the intelligence ministry the ministry of intelligence and security, in whose hands i found myself, was heir to the shah’s secret police, savak."
9770,murder,"its repressive apparatus cast a longer shadow over society; and it used methods, such as the murder of dissidents, rarely practiced by the shah’s secret police."
9771,power,"when the monarchy was overthrown in february 1979, the revolutionaries turned with fury on the members of the old regime, including cabinet officers, members of the military and police, and, of course, officers and operatives of savak, whose agents had been the interrogators, jailers, and sometimes the torturers of the men who were now in power."
9772,sentenced,hundreds and eventually thousands of men were brought before hastily convened revolutionary courts and then sent before the firing squads or sentenced to long prison terms.
9773,court,"in those chaotic early months, lines between interrogators, revolutionary court judges, and executioners were blurred."
9774,police,"willy-nilly, the nucleus of what would become the new secret police emerged: interrogators, investigators, men who made it their business to root out anyone they believed to be plotters, agents of foreigners, or dissidents."
9775,executed,"this air of improvisation continued through the first year of revolutionary terror and prevailed even in 1981–82, when the men around khomeini turned against some of the radical left-wing groups and thousands were executed in a second wave of terror."
9776,law,"however, in 1983, the majlis, or parliament, passed a law establishing the ministry of intelligence and security, formalizing what until then had been makeshift and improvised."
9777,charged,"it was charged with uncovering conspiracies; espionage; sabotage; coup plans; and incitement to unrest threatening to the political system, security, and territorial integrity of the country."
9778,prisoners,"mistreatment and torture of political prisoners and forced public confessions were, from the beginning, features of the postrevolution repressive apparatus."
9779,serving,"in 1983, for example, two leaders of the tudeh, iran’s communist party, were produced on television to confess to high treason, betrayal, belief in an “irrelevant ideology,” “foreign ways of thought,” and serving the soviet union’s interests."
9780,freedom,the ministry gained greater freedom of action and expanded its scope of operations in the post-khomeini period.
9781,arrest,"in march 1996, the german federal prosecutor issued a warrant for the arrest of minister of intelligence fallahian for his alleged role in planning the assassination."
9782,court,"in the following year, a german court found one iranian, the alleged leader, and two lebanese nationals guilty of killing sharafkandi and his associates and implicated iran’s highest officials in the assassination."
9783,killing,"in a particularly grisly killing in 1991, iranian agents murdered shapour bakhtiar, the shah’s last prime minister and leader of an opposition movement, slashing his throat in his own home in a paris suburb."
9784,power,"at home, the intelligence ministry launched a multipronged attack on intellectuals, writers, and journalists whom it considered liberal, secular, or western in orientation and who, along with members of the clerical establishment, advocated freedom of expression and criticized the manner in which power was exercised in the islamic republic."
9785,murder,"it sent out death squads to murder writers, journalists, and academics."
9786,arrested,it arrested others and subjected them to show trials and prison terms.
9787,notorious,"the national iranian television network followed up with the notorious biweekly program titled hoviyyat, or identity."
9788,custody,"in november 1994, the well-known writer and satirist ali akbar saidi-sirjani died while in police custody."
9789,arrested,"he had been arrested on trumpedup charges of spying, homosexuality, and drug use."
9790,death,"miraculously, one of the passengers, who awakened, was able to pull the brake and save the others from death or serious injury."
9791,interrogation,"in a letter later smuggled out of the country, sarkuhi revealed that he had been subjected to interrogation, beatings, and intense psychological intimidation over several weeks."
9792,police,"the police and security services cooperated, breaking up lectures by reformist intellectuals as well as protests and student demonstrations."
9793,war,khatami’s first term saw a tug-of-war between the reformers and the hard-liners.
9794,sentenced,"the mayor of tehran, gholam hossain karbaschi, a staunch supporter of the president, was tried on trumped-up charges of corruption, sentenced to a lengthy prison term, and barred from holding public office for ten years."
9795,imprisoned,"khatami’s interior minister, abdollah nuri, was forced out  of office, then tried and imprisoned for the views expressed in his highly popular newspaper, khordad."
9796,where,"when tehran university students staged rallies in july 1999 to protest the closure of one of these newspapers, club- and knife-wielding thugs broke up the protests and trashed the university dormitories where the demonstrations had taken place."
9797,charged,the police commander and seventeen officers charged and tried for the attack on the dormitories were all acquitted.
9798,chain,the chain of killings terrified the intellectual community—as they were intended to.
9799,freed,"the newly freed press, however, would not let the issue die, and khatami insisted on an investigation."
9800,arrested,"sa’id emami, who for years had been one of fallahian’s principle deputies, was arrested as the ringleader, along with a number of other ministry of intelligence agents."
9801,allegedly,"however, emami was conveniently found dead in the shower of his prison block, allegedly having committed suicide by swallowing a bottle of hair remover, in effect shutting down the “investigation.” khatami’s political party and its allies went on to win a majority in the 2000 parliamentary elections, and many prominent conservative candidates were soundly defeated."
9802,term,khatami himself comfortably won a second term in 2001.
9803,camp,"but by then, a full-scale onslaught on the reformist camp was under way."
9804,sentenced,"several prominent newspaper editors and journalists were tried and sentenced to multiyear prison terms, on charges of “undermining state security,” “insulting islam,” and “confusing” public opinion."
9805,arrested,"judiciary officials also arrested and tried several writers who had participated in a conference on iran at the heinrich böll institute in berlin, allegedly for insulting islamic sanctities and undermining national security in their remarks."
9806,sentenced,"in a clear warning to the intellectual community, six of the participants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to ten years."
9807,evin,"in 2003, the iranian canadian photographer zahra kazemi died while under interrogation at evin prison."
9808,death,"it was a further indication of the impunity enjoyed by the security services and their judicial accomplices that, parliamentary pressure notwithstanding, no one was ever tried for kazemi’s death, nor was any serious investigation into the circumstances leading to it ever carried out."
9809,state,"when ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, the repressive apparatus of the state had easily survived khatami’s attempted reforms and was in full resurgence."
9810,execution,"mostafa pourmohammadi, the newly appointed minister of the interior, had served as deputy minister of intelligence during the “serial murders” and was implicated in the mass execution of dissidents in evin prison in 1988."
9811,trial,"gholam hossein mohseni-eje’i, the new minister of intelligence, had served as a judge of the revolutionary courts, presiding over the trial of tehran mayor karbaschi and the trials of several reformist members of the clergy."
9812,evin,“we know how to handle you” my daily routine varied little over my first weeks in evin.
9813,cell,"a minute later, one of the guards came to my cell door and told me to put on my chador and prepare for interrogation."
9814,cell,"at the door of the cell block, she told me to put on my blindfold."
9815,interrogation,"he led the way to the interrogation room, calling out instructions in a monotonous loud voice, as i followed in my blindfold: “turn left,” “turn right,” “go straight,” “watch out for the stairs.” he wanted to avoid an accident."
9816,interrogation,"the interrogation room was very small, with just enough space for a school-type chairand-desk, at which i sat, and a larger desk with a cushioned chair for hajj agha or ja’fari."
9817,evin,"“we have a roomful of information about you.” ja’fari again asked me to describe my past career and work in iran: at the newspaper kayhan, at the women’s organization of iran, and at the shahbanou farah foundation— ground we had covered in detail in the pre-evin interrogations."
9818,pen,i took the paper and pen and deliberately wrote only a few lines about shaul’s career as an author and a university professor.
9819,interrogation,"by late afternoon i was tired, angry, and anxious at the bad turn the interrogation had taken."
9820,interrogation,"ja’fari seemed to have tired of the interrogation, too."
9821,cell,"he offered me his cell phone: “call your mother but don’t speak long,” he said."
9822,lawyer,"i managed again to convey, without ever using the word, that i needed a lawyer."
9823,ward,i put on my blindfold and followed ja’fari back up the stairs and through the corridors to ward 209.
9824,cell,"back in my cell, i practiced taking steps while wearing my blindfold."
9825,evin,"in the hands of hajj agha  when hajj agha took charge of the interrogation, as he increasingly did at evin, i would have to sit facing the wall."
9826,interrogation,he let me know by way of the guards if he could not make it to an interrogation for which he told me to prepare.
9827,state,he accused me of endangering state security.
9828,case,"however, after several weeks, hajj agha appeared to me to be focused on three goals: to build the case against me personally, to nail down what he believed to be the american “plan” for iran, and to lay out and have me endorse his characterization of the confrontation between iran and the united states and the role each was playing on the world stage."
9829,interrogation,hajj agha began his first interrogation session on a conciliatory note.
9830,imprisoned,"he cited the example of the more talkative ramin jahanbegloo, whom they had imprisoned and interrogated the previous year on similar charges."
9831,wall,"i would have loved to catch the expression on his face, but all i could see was the dirty wall before me."
9832,interrogation,"i gathered that the “roomful of documents” and “evidence” consisted of the prerevolution savak files; reports sent to tehran by the intelligence ministry’s own spooks in washington, d.c.; and what they had gleaned from their interrogation of ramin jahanbegloo."
9833,interrogation,"in the interrogation transcripts which ja’fari showed me, jahanbegloo had been coerced into depicting me as a major player on the washington scene and as the link between scholars, think tanks, and american government officials."
9834,interrogation,i was adamant during my interrogation in rejecting this false characterization.
9835,term,"at kayhan we had all known the middle-aged journalist who doubled as savak’s khabar-chin, the derogatory persian term for a hack informer."
9836,interrogation,"this could easily be refuted, even though facts and logic did not exactly reign supreme in the interrogation room."
9837,national security,"one morning when hajj agha accused me for the umpteenth time of endangering national security, my pent-up anger came spilling out."
9838,national security,"i was not endangering iran’s national security by organizing meetings and inviting university professors, intellectuals, and members of ngos from iran to speak, i shot back at hajj agha in a deliberately angry tone."
9839,state,they opposed outside  interference in iran’s internal affairs and had criticized the allocation of money by congress and the state department to encourage regime change in iran.
9840,taken,both ja’fari and hajj agha were taken aback.
9841,chain,you were snared into this chain of plots and plans simply because you were working for the wilson center; and you innocently became a tool in their hands.
9842,arrested,in no other country was a single program director arrested.
9843,incarceration,"the kayhan episode five or six days after my incarceration, ja’fari and hajj agha showed me a fresh copy of kayhan."
9844,death,it claimed that i had converted to judaism (an act considered apostasy in islam and punishable by death) and that i had fled to israel after the revolution and lived there for two years.
9845,charges,the article was making a case for charges of treason against me.
9846,wall,in the interrogation room i sat facing the wall as i read.
9847,court,"“if i am free one day, i will take kayhan to court.” hajj agha could see how upset i was and tried to calm me down."
9848,inmates,"a few days after this incident, i was walking on the larger of two rooftop terraces available to the inmates when i saw another copy of kayhan, neatly propped against the wall."
9849,arrested,"perhaps they thought reports of spy rings uncovered and spies arrested would lead me to  “confess.” i continued walking, passing the newspaper every time i circled the terrace, but i pretended never to have seen it."
9850,interrogation,"at that afternoon’s interrogation, hajj agha asked me if i was pleased with my new access to the larger terrace for my daily walk."
9851,charges,"since the newspaper was the organ of a hard-line faction in the intelligence ministry, shaul feared that this article was laying the foundation for the intelligence ministry’s formal charges against me."
9852,evin,"in any case, hajj agha showed up in evin prison a few days after the publication of the article and said to me: “such things are over and done with.” a compelling but mad logic outside prison, ja’fari’s and hajj agha’s repeated references to “the triangle,” “plots,” and “conspiracies” seemed outlandish, even amusing."
9853,confinement,"in solitary confinement, under interrogation, cut off from the outside world, accused of the most serious crimes against the state, i found these endlessly repeated assertions sinister: part of a world of secret cabals, plotters, and conspiracies in which i was supposedly involved without being aware of it."
9854,interrogation,"but in the isolation of prison and the interrogation room, i had to fight hard to avoid hajj agha’s conspiratorial mind-set."
9855,question,"additionally, hajj agha’s friendlier approach was in some ways harder to handle than the long, exhausting question-and-answer sessions with ja’fari."
9856,war,he once went into a long disquisition on the cold war.
9857,police,i wanted to steel myself by recalling the interrogation techniques of police states elsewhere and the lonely men and women who had managed to survive them.
9858,interrogation,one night i was woken up at eleven o’clock and summoned for interrogation.
9859,interrogation,"i had heard of all-night interrogation sesions and, full of trepidation, i dressed hastily and was taken before the two men."
9860,cell,"but it can wait till tomorrow.” back in my cell, i sat on my chair."
9861,cell,"i looked up at the night sky through the bars of my cell: it was overcast, and i couldn’t see the moon or a single star."
9862,question,"“how do you know obama?” one afternoon, in the middle of another five-hour session, hajj agha threw me off track with an odd question: “how do you know obama?” he asked."
9863,evin,“do you mean the senator from illinois?” it was june 2007 and news of his run for president had reached me before i was taken to evin.
9864,case,"in a conversation only two days earlier, hajj agha had greatly unnerved me when he said, in a mocking tone, “you have more friends in iran than in america; and your iranian friends are more harmful than helpful to your case."
9865,case,"i don’t think i persuaded hajj agha that obama took up my case simply because i was an american citizen, but he had thrown me a lifeline."
9866,incarceration,"hajj agha reluctantly admitted that hillary clinton had also issued a statement regarding my incarceration, but he tried to be dismissive."
9867,cell,"“why shouldn’t she talk about you?” back in my cell, i tried to factor the obama news into my calculation of where i stood."
9868,arrest,"i knew that shaul, with whom i had been allowed no contact since my arrest, would be doing everything in his power to get me released, that he would be making phone calls, seeking contacts, looking for influential international figures to intercede on my behalf, and that lee hamilton would do the same."
9869,pleading,"but i also knew that in political cases iran’s officials could be obdurate and impervious to external pressure, publicity, or pleading, which was why we had reserved asking for outside help as an option of last resort."
9870,sentenced,"in july 2000, ten iranian jews from shiraz were tried behind closed doors on trumped-up charges of espionage and sentenced to long prison terms, despite an international outcry, the direct intervention of the european union,  and a promise to european ambassadors that the trial would be public and they could attend."
9871,sentenced,human-rights groups protested when prominent journalists such as ganji were put on trial; but ganji and his colleagues were sentenced and jailed anyway.
9872,arrested,"ganji and other arrested journalists, intellectuals, and politicians had merited a story or two in the american and european press and were then forgotten."
9873,arrest,"i could not know, of course, that the story of my arrest and incarceration had become worldwide news and that my story had captured the public imagination."
9874,arrest,"i was unaware that shaul and hamilton had taken part in numerous interviews, that leading american papers had condemned my arrest in their editorials, that i was the subject of commentary by columnists, and that european governments were intervening with the iranians on my behalf."
9875,trial,"in my isolation at evin, i had focused all my faculties on the interrogation and was fighting desperately to avoid a trial."
9876,case,“i thought it must be that khanum esfandiari laid a curse on me.” i assured him this was not the case.
9877,evin,"i don’t want to start all over again with another interrogator.” it appeared to me that hajj agha was marking time, but the prospect of a drawn-out stay at evin was hardly comforting."
9878,court,"it turned out to be a court order for a one-month extension of my detention—“it’s just routine, don’t pay any attention to it,” he said."
9879,prison ,"evin prison  for the nearly four months of my solitary confinement in evin, my only human contacts were the guards, the interrogators, and the occasional prison doctor."
9880,inmate,i never once spoke to another inmate.
9881,incarceration,"i had no watch, until they returned mine two months into the incarceration."
9882,prisoners,ward 209 was reserved for political prisoners and run by the intelligence ministry.
9883,building,it was located on the uppermost floor of evin’s main building.
9884,interrogation,"though blindfolded whenever i passed through the door, i caught occasional glimpses of the men’s section when i was taken to the interrogation rooms or to the dispensary."
9885,interrogation,"the men’s cells stood along a long corridor, punctuated by doors leading to interrogation rooms, the one-room dispensary, and an enclosed rooftop terrace."
9886,interrogation,ja’fari once had me brought to this terrace for interrogation.
9887,interrogation,"he was recovering from knee surgery, the interrogation rooms on the men’s corridor were in use, and he wanted to avoid going up and down the stairs to the lower-level interrogation rooms."
9888,inmates,"along the men’s corridor, guards sat behind a couple of small desks at all hours, keeping watch as inmates were moved about."
9889,inmates,"on the women’s block, doors led in succession to the small rooftop terrace, the inmates’ bathroom, the separate guards’ bathroom, and a row of five or six prisoners’ cells."
9890,cell,you could hear it all night long through the thick cell walls.
9891,wall,"against the far wall, between the two rooms, was a chair for the guard on duty."
9892,wall,"the wall opposite the cells had two barred windows, one of which contained an airconditioning unit that served the whole block."
9893,where,"there were also hooks where the guards hung their chadors, and pictures of ayatollah khomeini and ayatollah khamenei, the current supreme leader."
9894,evin,the same two pictures appeared virtually everywhere you turned in evin—in the interrogation rooms and lining the corridors.
9895,prisoner,the harsh world they created and ran had turned on me and made me a prisoner.
9896,toilet,"the women’s bathroom consisted of a single shower and an iranian-style toilet, a ceramic basin sunk into the ground."
9897,inmates,"the inmates were supposed to clean the bathroom after use, but no one did."
9898,toilet,"on one occasion, the toilet was so disgustingly filthy, i complained to the guard, who made the previous user clean it."
9899,evin,"for a while i was limited to the regulation one hour a day, but once she left evin, i had longer use of the terraces."
9900,cell,"i never saw the other prisoners in the women’s block, but i could hear them—knocking on their cell doors to go to the bathroom, sometimes exchanging angry words with the guards."
9901,inmates,none of the other women inmates spent as long in solitary as i did; the usual stint was two or three weeks.
9902,prisoner,i could tell when a new prisoner was brought in because the cover over the small opening in my cell door would be pulled shut.
9903,prisoner,"when i was in the corridor myself, a door left wide open to reveal an empty cell meant a prisoner had been released or transferred elsewhere."
9904,trial,the possibility of a show trial weighed heavily on my mind.
9905,incarceration,"i knew i had to be mentally strong, keep my wits about me, remain focused on the interrogations, and do everything in my power to thwart the fate the intelligence ministry was planning for me: a coerced confession, a trial on trumped-up charges, a lengthy incarceration."
9906,guard,"at my request, a guard knocked on my door at six a.m."
9907,cell,"i got up, vigorously paced the length of my cell for an hour, and then showered and changed."
9908,inmates,"after breakfast, i resumed stretching exercises, push-ups, and pacing until it was time to go out on one of the two rooftop terraces available to the inmates."
9909,imprisonment,counting repetitions helped me avoid brooding over the long imprisonment that stretched before me.
9910,exercise,some days i would exercise for six hours or more.
9911,cell,"nothing in my previous experience had prepared me for evin, but knew i had to avoid the listlessness that overtakes prisoners and to stave off depression, which lurked like a dark shadow in every corner of my cell."
9912,cell,"for reading, i initially had only the quran that was already in my cell and the one book i had with me when arrested, a recently published collection of letters written by a royal princess in the late nineteenth century—an interesting window into changing female sensibility."
9913,incarceration,"in the second week of my incarceration, one of the guards began to bring me books from the prison library, mostly on shi’ism."
9914,evin,i was bemused by the thought that the left-wing author of zorba the greek had fans in evin prison.
9915,inmate,"later, kian tajbakhsh, the other iranian american inmate, was allowed to share his books with me."
9916,inmate,no other inmate was allowed on the seven-foot-long terrace while i used it; no two inmates were even allowed to see each other.
9917,wall,"three cats—one black, one gray, and one golden brown—perennially prowled the top of the wall."
9918,court,it was about the size of a volleyball court and a far superior place for walking.
9919,inmates,"the smaller terrace was reserved for the women inmates, but the larger terrace was used by both the men and the women in ward 209."
9920,inmates,"inmates were allowed one hour a day for what was called hava-khori, or taking the air."
9921,inmates,"but since none of the other women inmates wanted to be outside, the guards allowed me more time on the terraces."
9922,evin,"after my first night at evin, when i slept uncomfortably on the floor on a single blanket, i was offered a cot."
9923,cell,"plus, a cot would take up too much space in my small cell and i wouldn’t be able to keep up with my exercises."
9924,war,"i smiled to myself, thinking i would look like snoopy, in his imaginary role as a world war i flying ace, and i declined."
9925,ward,the guards the women’s section of ward 209 was the kingdom of six female guards.
9926,ward,"she had studied at a howzeh, or religious seminary, was well versed in the religious sciences, and often walked around the ward quietly reciting verses of the quran to herself."
9927,cell,"when the ward was quiet and the other inmates and guards were resting, she stood outside my cell door and discussed with me various quranic verses."
9928,inmates,when the inmates were given sweets for dessert she would bring me an extra slice.
9929,cell,"one morning, she came into my cell, quietly took out a white rose from under her chador, handed it to me, and left."
9930,evin,"the gesture, in the unkind world of evin, moved me."
9931,inmates,"while the others tried to make prison conditions more bearable for the inmates, sour face seemed intent on making them more onerous."
9932,inmate,"she groused when i or another inmate asked for tea, even if it was teatime."
9933,inmate,"she was reluctant to let an inmate out, even if it was her turn to spend an hour on the terrace."
9934,justice,islamic justice doesn’t make mistakes.
9935,guilty,"all of you are here because you are guilty and you don’t want to repent.” she got so worked up that foam formed at the corners of her lips, and her voice turned into a hiss."
9936,cell,i walked past her into my cell and closed the door behind me.
9937,evin,she schooled me in evin’s shopping opportunities.
9938,inmates,"every tuesday, inmates could list the items they needed and a prison employee would make the purchases in the local market."
9939,ordered,i always ordered a week’s supply of vegetables and fruit.
9940,incarceration,"without her bread, i might have shed another five pounds on top of the twenty pounds i had lost during my incarceration."
9941,evin,"(but once back home, and to this day, i could not bring myself to try the dish and stir up memories of evin.)"
9942,inmates,"“other inmates sit in a corner or nap in the afternoons,” she said."
9943,state,"except for athlete’s one moment of selfreflection during her visit to the savak museum, i never sensed they had second thoughts about working for the intelligence services or the repressive apparatus of the state."
9944,inmates,"prison cuisine unlike the rest of evin prison, where, according to twiggy, the food was disgusting, the inmates of ward 209 ate relatively well, since they were served the same food as the intelligence ministry’s staff."
9945,prisoner,"for breakfast, each prisoner was given tea and a loaf of bread with cream cheese."
9946,inmates,"the doctors every two weeks, inmates in ward 209 paid a visit to the prison doctor."
9947,evin,i was taken to the prison doctor on my first morning at evin.
9948,incarceration,"two weeks into my incarceration, around ten o’clock on a friday night, athlete suddenly showed up: “let’s go."
9949,evin,"it was late, and i had heard of the use of “truth serum” at evin."
9950,evin,it was one of the oddities of life at evin that the strictures regarding female modesty ended where inconvenience began.
9951,incarceration,"until the third month of my incarceration, i was taken to the dispensary every two weeks to have my weight and blood pressure checked."
9952,evin,"i used refresh over-the-counter eye drops and took vitamins for my bone and eye conditions, but mutti was not allowed to bring me my medication from home, and i refused the substitutes offered at evin."
9953,alleged,hajj agha alleged that refresh eye drops came from israel.
9954,incarceration,"late in the second month of my incarceration, the physician on duty—he happened to be the doctor who examined me on my first day—brought up the subject of my trust in iranian medicine again."
9955,inmate,"a previous inmate was so happy in the hospital, he didn’t want to leave, even to go home, he added."
9956,charges,i don’t care on what charges you are here.
9957,taken,"i have taken an oath to look after the health of my patients, and i don’t want to be accused of negligence.” he made me write down and sign a statement attesting that i had refused hospitalization."
9958,arrested,we weighed the consequences carefully before we arrested you.
9959,prisoner,no iranian political prisoner  had received sustained press coverage.
9960,case,"i didn’t think my case would be any different, even with the efforts of shaul, the wilson center, or shirin ebadi."
9961,confinement,"my release was not imminent, and my isolation and solitary confinement were continuing with no end in sight."
9962,cell,i quickly put the doctor’s comments out of my mind and returned to my cell.
9963,cell,"calling mother two or three times a week, at the end of every interrogation, i was allowed to call my mother on ja’fari’s cell phone."
9964,cell,"ja’fari would ask me the number—even after twelve weeks, he couldn’t manage to remember it—dial it, and hand me the cell phone."
9965,cell,"if his cell phone battery was low, he would use one of the many phones placed along the corridors."
9966,prisoners,"these were available to prisoners under fewer restrictions than i. i was instructed to be brief, to limit myself to pleasantries, and to speak to mutti only in persian, never in german."
9967,death,"even as i was dreaming, i fearfully imagined that if my grandmother talked to me, it meant my death was imminent."
9968,arrest,"one of these i dubbed the “tsunami affair.” in a telephone conversation with shaul before my arrest, i told him yet again of my certainty that i would be arrested and taken to evin."
9969,incarceration,"shaul said: “if they take you to prison, i will unleash a tsunami in the press the likes of which they have never seen.” several weeks into my incarceration, fearing i had been forgotten by the outside world, i remembered that conversation and wanted in some way to convey to shaul that the time for the tsunami had come, that he must get the media to focus on my plight immediately."
9970,taken,he clearly wasn’t taken in.
9971,evin,a walking corpse i genuinely did not want mutti to visit me in evin.
9972,case,"in any case, ja’fari had told me to tell my mother to stop coming to the prison gate with fruit, medication, and clothing."
9973,evin,"i also concluded that the intelligence ministry understood very well that if a photograph of my mother was published abroad—bent over her cane, barely able to see, slowly making her way and carrying a bag of fruit to evin’s grim gate—it would cause a sensation."
9974,imprisoned,"in past years, i recalled, imprisoned journalists akbar ganji and emadeddin baghi had been allowed weekends home."
9975,evin,"in the 1990s, tehran’s former mayor gholam hossein karbaschi had been briefly let out of evin to attend his daughter’s wedding."
9976,sentenced,"(in the bizarre ways of the islamic republic, mohseni-eje’i, the infamous judge who had presided over karbaschi’s trial and had unjustly sentenced him to a long prison term, attended the wedding, too.)"
9977,sentenced,"ja’fari noted that these three men had been tried and sentenced before they were allowed home visits, but hajj agha agreed to ask permission for a home visit from his superiors if i could guarantee none of the neighbors would find out."
9978,building,"mother’s apartment building was small, the neighbors all knew one another and noticed comings and goings in the building, and a caretaker was on duty at all times."
9979,evin,"“we have a number of safe houses around evin,” he said."
9980,where,"“we can move you and your mother to a safe house, where you can live together and keep each other company.” the idea of living in a “safe” house belonging to the intelligence ministry made my skin crawl."
9981,evin,"the “interview” on my very first day at evin, hajj agha had hinted that my release would be expedited if i gave “an interview” explaining what i knew of the american agenda for regime change in iran."
9982,state,"he cited the example of ramin jahanbegloo, the philosopher and scholar who had spent four months in evin on fabricated charges of acting against the interests of the state and who “at his own suggestion” had given an interview to the iranian student news agency (isna) on the very day he was released from evin."
9983,interrogation,"now, four weeks later, during an interrogation, he informed me that the “interview” would take place on the following thursday."
9984,prisoners,i had always loathed seeing political prisoners paraded on television to parrot what they had been told to say.
9985,inside,i had to laugh —inside.
9986,evin,"on thursday morning, hajj khanum appeared with my purse, which i had not seen since  it was taken from me the day i entered evin."
9987,case,she also handed me lipstick and a powder case.
9988,cell,"my days were spent in solitary confinement in a bare cell, but i was to be shown to the world in a comfortable, living room–like setting."
9989,state,"here i was, accused of endangering state security, yet my interrogator wanted to make sure that i looked “modern” and, like the young women on tehran’s streets, casual in the way i wore my islamic dress."
9990,sentences,we had to do another take of these last sentences.
9991,ward,"back in the ward, i wanted to shower."
9992,taken,"at one point in the interview, i deliberately said, “in the five months i have been here…,” hoping my family would deduce when the taping session had taken place."
9993,term,"for example, a new term, shabakeh-sazi, had been coined for “networking” and had become fashionable in intellectual circles in iran; but i had not heard it before or ever used it myself."
9994,police,i also expected that friends and those familiar with the ways of the islamic republic and police states would know that the “interview” was staged and coerced.
9995,cell,i paced my cell in anger and frustration.
9996,cell,i banged my cell door behind me when returning from the bathroom or the rooftop terrace.
9997,interrogation,"when he finally returned to the interrogation room hajj agha said the interview “was not what the gentlemen expected.” nevertheless, he claimed, “i am doing my best to get you released, but the americans don’t make it easy for you."
9998,arrested,"they didn’t allow any visits to the families of the irbil five.” the “irbil five” referred to five iranian officials who had been arrested in irbil, iraq, by the american military forces in january."
9999,case,i was dismayed that my case was being linked to them.
10000,war,the irbil five were iranian officials in a war zone.
10001,evin,tajbakhsh was still at evin.
10002,confinement,"jahanbegloo had been released from evin a year before, after spending four months in solitary confinement."
10003,evin,"a few days after the broadcast, hajj agha came to evin fuming."
10004,evin,i listened quietly as he continued his tirade: he had vouched for jahanbegloo the previous year when he was in evin; he persuaded his superiors to release him and let him go abroad; now look how ungrateful he turned out to be.
10005,sentences,the intelligence ministry even spliced two disparate sentences of mine to make it appear that i was conceding that i had taken part in creating networks whose purpose was to bring about fundamental change in the iranian system of government.
10006,police,"in a washington post op-ed, my daughter, haleh, described the program as “a kgb-style television ‘confession’…a typical secret-police job of deception, vicious in intent yet clumsily contrived.” but it was the response to the broadcasts in iran that fascinated me."
10007,executed,"even kayhan, in a post-broadcast commentary, criticized the program as badly executed and confusing in its message to the mass of viewers."
10008,arrest,"it was supposed to vindicate my arrest and long incarceration; but it persuaded no one, and its utter failure helps explain my subsequent release."
10009,cell,news of the outside world in early august haji agha offered me a tv for my cell.
10010,detention,"on more than one occasion, hajj agha had threatened to extend my detention order for another four months."
10011,inmates,"three newspapers were generally available to inmates of ward 209, but kayhan had been reduced to the organ of the intelligence ministry and specialized in lies and character assassination."
10012,cell,one morning in early august twiggy came to my cell and told me to put on my chador.
10013,incarceration,i didn’t want them to make it homey; i didn’t want my interrogators to boast to my mother and the world that i was comfortable and had what i needed; and i hated the idea that they were preparing to extend my incarceration at evin.
10014,where,"in a country where satellite dishes are officially banned (although every home has a concealed or a shockingly not-so-concealed satellite dish), one can’t expect cnn in prison."
10015,war,"on the anniversary of israel’s 2006 war with lebanon, i heard the speech and an interview given by the iranian ally and hizbollah leader hassan nasrallah numerous times."
10016,law,"the previous summer, we had spent a week in kennebunkport with haleh; my son-in-law, john; and our grandchildren."
10017,cell,i looked around at the four bare walls of my cell.
10018,interrogation,"during the previous afternoon’s interrogation, ja’fari hadn’t said a word about a visit."
10019,building,we walked out the same door through which i had entered the prison building three months earlier.
10020,evin,"once we stepped into the courtyard of evin, i removed my blindfold."
10021,taken,"i also feared the whole thing might be a ruse, and that i wasn’t being taken to see mutti at all."
10022,death,"what if they take me to a deserted place outside the city, beat me to death, and dump my body in a ditch?"
10023,building,the car stopped in front of a large building still in the evin compound.
10024,inmates,"all over the room, inmates sat at small tables talking to family members."
10025,where,"“they decided your mother cannot manage the stairs.” we went into a spare, smaller room, where a woman sat behind a desk."
10026,wall,"i then led her to one of the chairs arranged against the wall, not letting go of her hands."
10027,evin,mutti went on to say that shirin ebadi was acting as my lawyer but had been denied any access to evin whatsoever.
10028,pleading,"mutti had written a letter to the supreme leader, ayatollah khamenei, pleading for my release."
10029,ward,"i had lived in the world of ward 209, with its female guards dreaming of rash-free skin and flatter tummies, interrogators endlessly repeating the same questions, and the doctor with the ridiculous hairpiece."
10030,case,but for the “interview” i had been able to look into the mirror of my powder case.
10031,building,i walked out of the building with hajj khanum in tow.
10032,building,we drove to the main building.
10033,ward,once again i put on my hated blindfold and climbed the stairs back to ward 209.
10034,power,"had i the power, i would have called down the wrath of god on them."
10035,trial,"i waited for good news on important religious holidays, when the leader customarily issued pardons, but the birthday of the prophet and of imam ali passed and nothing happened (i should have known i was hoping in vain, as pardons are issued only after trial and sentencing)."
10036,prisoners,"all the other female prisoners in ward 209 had left, and the ward was virtually empty."
10037,case,when i looked in the mirror of my powder case i was startled by the wasted face i saw.
10038,death,i prayed i would be let out in time for the anniversary of my father’s death.
10039,arrest,before my arrest i had seen her standing before a picture of my father in the apartment and mumbling to him: “helli is your daughter.
10040,interrogation,"the letter on the afternoon of august 2, ja’fari summoned me for another interrogation."
10041,prisoners,we waited for a group of male prisoners to pass.
10042,where,ja’fari led me to the room where i had already spent so many hours.
10043,wall,i hung my chador on a wooden peg and sat facing the wall.
10044,wall,"while still facing the wall, i stretched my hand behind me to show him my swollen fingers."
10045,cell,my eyes were weaker due to the lack of eye drops and the lights that were on in my cell twenty-four hours a day.
10046,jail,“why am i still in jail?” i asked him.
10047,where,"oddly enough, he was a graduate of george mason university, where shaul taught."
10048,case,"i did not know if khazaee would act simply as a messenger, relaying messages back and forth, or if he would throw his weight behind a resolution of my case."
10049,ward,rashti was on duty when ja’fari took me back to the ward.
10050,ward,we went straight to one of the phones outside the ward.
10051,question,"rashti looked at me with a silent question in her eyes: “any hope?” “maybe we have a goshayesh—an opening,” i said."
10052,ward,"sunny face summoned ja’fari for me—he and hajj agha wanted to know as soon as i heard from mutti—and ten minutes later we stood face-to-face at the iron door of the women’s block of ward 209, i in my robe and scarf but without a blindfold or chador, he in his checkered shirt and sandals."
10053,incarceration,"my incarceration had dragged on, and the adverse publicity was damaging iran’s international standing."
10054,case,khamenei probably decided it was time he stepped in to bring the case to an end.
10055,where,"they were staying for two weeks, and i dreamed of getting out soon enough to join them, to walk with them by the sea, and to take the children for breakfast at the pancake place near the house where they were staying."
10056,evin,the next four days were the longest of my stay in evin.
10057,cell,"at one moment i pictured myself on a plane heading for home; in the next moment, i saw myself pacing my cell week after week and month after month, in timeless, sisyphian futility."
10058,evin,"i had trained myself in evin to avoid such thoughts and mood swings, and not to hope in order not to despair."
10059,case,"to me, this all sounded very vague and not the clear break in my case i had desperately begun to believe in."
10060,case,"the head of the supreme national security council, ali larijani, told reporters he expected my case to be brought to conclusion soon and that “we don’t want to keep her,” or words to that effect."
10061,guilty,"besides, if the intelligence ministry was about to hand my case over to the judiciary, this could mean formal charges, a trial, and a guilty verdict."
10062,sentence,"given the accusations against me, a sentence could mean anything from twenty years to penalty of death."
10063,cell,"pacing in my cell while listening to television news in mid-august, i heard that the bush administration was about to designate iran’s revolutionary guards a terrorist organization."
10064,war,"iran wanted to use me as a bargaining chip; the united states, engaged in an undeclared war with iran and focused on its global interests, would not stop to consider the impact of its decisions on the fate of a single individual."
10065,cell,athlete announced she was taking a few days off and came to the door of my cell to say  good-bye.
10066,detention,"matin-rassekh might renew my detention order for another four months or, at best, issue an order transferring me from ward 209 to the general ward for women prisoners."
10067,prisoner,"i would be out of the clutches of the intelligence ministry but, oddly enough, i did not welcome the prospect of becoming an “ordinary” prisoner or being lost in the general prison population."
10068,cell,"i would have to share a cell with other inmates, and i would be allowed to bathe and call my mother only once a week."
10069,ward,"here i at least had privacy, and i had imposed on the deadening dullness of ward 209 a rhythm and order that allowed me to survive."
10070,ward,"he met me, in my blindfold, by the iron door of the ward and led me to one of the interrogation rooms next to the dispensary."
10071,wall,"i was facing the wall; but behind me i could hear the rustling of paper as he leafed through my file, going over the responses i had given to earlier questions."
10072,ward,he led me back to the ward.
10073,cell,"“you must be joking” two or three days later, i was doing my afternoon exercises in my cell, standing as close as possible to the door and its peephole to catch the bit of cool air from the air conditioner in the hallway."
10074,case,"two weeks had passed since hamilton had been to new york, and there was still no movement in my case."
10075,interrogation,hajj khanum came in and told me to prepare for interrogation.
10076,wall,"i sat in the interrogation room, facing the wall."
10077,bail,"“don’t worry,” i said, “i know i am not supposed to see you.” i inquired about bail."
10078,interrogation,"the narrow, suffocating interrogation room seemed suddenly larger; instead of pressing down on me, the walls seemed to be moving back; the ceiling seemed to be rising."
10079,interrogation,"i too got up and was about to walk out of the interrogation room when i heard ja’fari’s loud “kojaaa?”, the a elongated as always."
10080,where,“where do you think you’re going?” i realized that in my excitement i was walking out without my chador and blindfold.
10081,inmate,i would have run back to the ward had i not feared crashing into a wall or another blindfolded inmate.
10082,ward,"for four months, i had prayed for this moment, and i could not leave ward 209, evin prison—and iran—fast enough."
10083,cell,"i gathered every item of clothing in my cell; they went into the garbage bag, too, to be thrown away."
10084,freed,"twiggy, thoroughly excited, had brought my handbag and a pair of trousers, a t-shirt, a robe, and a scarf i had set aside for the day i was freed."
10085,evin,"i dressed, determined to walk out wearing nothing bearing the mark or odor of evin."
10086,incarceration,i chose a blue scarf rather than the black scarf i had worn every day since my incarceration.
10087,where,hajj khanum walked back in: “where are your discharge papers?” a jolt of panic shot through my body.
10088,evin,i wanted to erase all evin’s traces; i wanted to be clean again.
10089,cell,"i also had to fill out a questionnaire regarding prison conditions: the cell, the food, the medical attention, the general hygiene, and how i had been treated."
10090,guard,"i gave the prison guards a glowing evaluation, then i embraced each guard in turn, even sour face."
10091,interrogation,"with her finger, hajj khanum traced the name of imam ali on my forehead, as she had done when i went for my tv interview and sometimes even when i went for interrogation."
10092,charge,twiggy took charge of my bags.
10093,ward,"for the first time since entering evin, i walked out of the ward without a chador or blindfold."
10094,prisoners,"as we moved toward the exit, i saw a group of incoming prisoners: they stood blindfolded and facing the wall, anxious and disoriented—grown men and women reduced, like children, to helplessness."
10095,building,we stopped at the building where i had met my mother two weeks earlier.
10096,prisoners,"inside, a crowd of prisoners were waiting to be discharged."
10097,evin,i walked with twiggy across the cobblestones toward the great iron gates of evin.
10098,interrogation,"the hulking prison, with its gray walls and barbed wire, its cells and interrogation rooms, which had been my prison and my home for 105 days, was now behind me."
10099,gate,"outside the gate, a television camera crew was waiting."
10100,question,“how do you feel?” i thought it a most stupid question.
10101,inmate,any released inmate feels the same.
10102,freedom,"i thanked the people who made my freedom possible, without mentioning any names."
10103,authorities,the reporter persisted: how did the prison authorities treat me?
10104,confinement,what was solitary confinement like?
10105,confinement,solitary confinement was hardly pleasant.
10106,charge,"he had set bail at 300 million tomans, or around $375,000, more than ten times the bail set by the first magistrate i had seen and before matin-rassekh took charge of my case."
10107,evin,"i told each of them how elated i was to be out of evin prison, but that i didn’t know if and when i could leave for home."
10108,evin,i had to cleanse myself of evin and its smell.
10109,evin,"for some inexplicable reason, he insisted on delivering the medicine prescribed by the prison doctors, which i had never used at evin."
10110,taken,"the smirk seemed permanently etched into his face, and i couldn’t erase from my memory the pleasure he had taken in tormenting me."
10111,ordered,she had ordered an excellent meal of rice and leg of lamb from a neighborhood restaurant.
10112,incarceration,it was a collection of the many hundreds of news stories about me that had appeared during my incarceration.
10113,case,"that night i slipped the cd into a borrowed laptop and encountered, with growing astonishment, the huge media coverage and public interest my case had generated."
10114,incarceration,"just before my incarceration, shaul had concluded that silence and quiet diplomacy were doing us little good."
10115,arrested,"as it happened, i was arrested early on the morning of may 8, and by the time shaul and the wilson center people met, i was already in evin prison."
10116,illegal,he had addressed a hastily summoned press conference and had firmly rejected any suggestion i was engaged in illegal activities.
10117,arrest,"my arrest was widely reported that day, and press interest and coverage of my ordeal remained strong for almost the entire 105 days of my incarceration."
10118,confinement,the story of a sixty-seven-year-old grandmother held in solitary confinement in a notorious prison simply for having organized conferences on iranian and middle eastern issues was in itself compelling.
10119,incarceration,"as shaul put it to me, “every time we thought the story was dying, the iranian government did or said something outrageous to reignite interest in your case.” within a week of my incarceration, the spokesperson for the judiciary, ali reza jamshidi, announced that i was being investigated for “crimes against national security.” two weeks later, he said i was accused by the intelligence ministry of espionage, activities against national security, and propaganda against the islamic republic."
10120,sentence,"the intelligence ministry accused me of “seeking to topple the islamic regime” and claimed my interrogation had allowed them to uncover “networks” and expose “subversives.” these accusations, if formalized as charges in an indictment, carried the death sentence."
10121,incarceration,"my incarceration also evoked memories of the seizure of the american embassy in tehran in 1979, when american diplomats were taken hostage; journalists were quick to draw parallels."
10122,arrested,"robin wright, the washington post diplomatic correspondent, wrote that “the united states has not faced such tension over americans held in iran since the 1979–1981 hostage crisis, when 52 americans were held for 444 days.” other journalists and commentators speculated that the iranians intended to swap me for the “irbil five.” in march, a naval patrol of iran’s revolutionary guards had arrested fifteen british sailors and marines in the persian gulf, claiming they were in iranian territorial waters."
10123,trial,shaul was particularly anxious to prevent a show trial and to discredit such a trial even before it had begun.
10124,trial,he could not think of a major political trial under the islamic republic in which the accused was found innocent.
10125,guilt,"rather, a trial was synonymous with a finding of guilt."
10126,court,"judging by the manipulation of my remarks in the television “interview,” he feared they would produce a “confession” in court."
10127,trial,"in a june 27 op-ed in the new york times, he warned that a trial based on false confessions seemed imminent."
10128,lawyer,"“they only make the regime look inhumane.” my lawyer, shirin ebadi, generated considerable press coverage as well."
10129,arrest,"the judicial authorities and intelligence services loathed her; she was outspoken and unafraid, yet since she was a nobel laureate, they did not dare arrest or silence her."
10130,charges,"matin-rassekh refused to allow shirin to meet with me in evin prison, refused to allow her to see the file on my case, and refused even to specify the charges against me."
10131,lawyer,"he also refused to meet with her, and when she was finally able to speak with him by telephone on july 4, he told her in effect that “haleh esfandiari does not need a lawyer.” but, true to her word, shirin did make a lot of noise."
10132,case,"on visits to europe and the united states, she used press conferences and speeches to publicize my case."
10133,arrest,my arrest and incarceration earned iran universally bad press.
10134,arrested,"it recently arrested a 67-year-old grandmother, whom it accused of trying to bring down the regime by organizing academic conferences!” robin wright wrote an eye-catching profile of me for the washington post’s style section."
10135,case,"this made holding me increasingly costly for the iranian government, and it raised doubts in the minds of some officials about the intelligence ministry’s attempt to construct, on my slight frame, a case of subversion and espionage."
10136,state,"for example, when listing the accusations against me on may 21 (espionage, actions against the security of the state), the judiciary spokesperson seemed to distance the judiciary from these accusations by describing the ministry of intelligence as the “complainant” in the case and implying these were still accusations, not formal charges."
10137,criminal,"as late as august 6, the judiciary’s spokesperson said no criminal charges or indictment had yet been brought against me."
10138,national security,"in prison, i had dismissed the remark of national security adviser larijani that “we don’t want to keep her” as mere talk."
10139,arrested,"moreover, while the intelligence ministry expected some american and international disapproval when they arrested me—hajj agha told me as much—they were unprepared for the deluge of prominent international figures who interceded on my behalf, producing an international effort that spanned europe, the middle east, and asia."
10140,incarceration,"javier solana, the eu foreign minister, referred to my incarceration on at least two occasions with the iranians."
10141,case,"as part of the eu dialogue with iran on human-rights issues, the european ambassadors in tehran formally raised my case and that of several other dual nationals with the iranian foreign ministry twice, in written demarches presented in late june and early august."
10142,case,"the austrian ambassador in tehran, michael postl, was particularly persistent in pursuing my case with the supreme leader’s foreign policy adviser."
10143,state,"strobe talbott, president of the brookings institution and former deputy secretary of state, spoke about me to japanese prime minister shinzo abe when he met with him in tokyo in may, and abe’s foreign minister spoke to his iranian counterpart."
10144,state,"martin indyk, head of the saban center at brookings and a former assistant secretary of state for near east affairs,  raised my case with the foreign minister of oman."
10145,state,"bush administration deputy undersecretary of state nicholas burns raised my case with the indian foreign minister, who spoke to his iranian counterpart."
10146,case,"in february, he wrote a letter to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad, urging his intervention in the case, but received no reply or acknowledgment."
10147,case,"it was only after he wrote to the iranian leader, setting in motion his august 7 trip to new york, that there was concrete movement in my case."
10148,arrest,"an international civil society on the day of my arrest, my iraqi friend zainab al-suwaij, the president of the american islamic congress, told her husband, “i have to do something for haleh.” two days later, she and her colleagues at the aic launched the free haleh web site."
10149,jail,"why, she demanded, was i in jail?"
10150,law,"at the initiative of haleh’s father-in-law, john warden sr., the new york bar association produced a detailed legal brief describing the ways in which the iranian government had violated the iranian constitution, its own laws, and iran’s international commitments in incarcerating me and denying me legal representation."
10151,case,"a rabbi in brazil learned about my case through the efforts of my cousin goli and urged all 3,000 people on his e-mail list to sign a petition initiated by the women of washington, an organization she helped run."

10158,evin,"particularly hurtful was a new york times op-ed by an older, former student of mine published while i was still in evin prison."
10159,prisoner,"under the title of “prisoner of her desires,” the author, an advocate of punitive sanctions and military threats against iran, used my arrest as a prop to argue his own case, suggesting that i had received my just deserts for having naively advocated dialogue with the iranians."
10160,case,the intelligence ministry sought to persuade a mass audience that it had a strong case in claiming american schemes for a “velvet revolution” in iran.
10161,trial,"but perhaps far more important, if the intelligence ministry was toying with the idea of a show trial, international attention and condemnation of iran’s behavior made sure such a trial—and its possibly fatal outcome—never took place."
10162,freedom,"freedom  in the days after my release, i gloried in my freedom and took pleasure in small things: sleeping in a clean bed with ironed sheets, being able to turn off a bedside lamp and sleep in soothing darkness, looking into a mirror again, wearing my own slippers instead of plastic prison slippers."
10163,hole,"i did not have to see, first thing in the morning, a toilet that was a filthy hole in the ground."
10164,cell,i no longer had to wait with pleading eyes for ja’fari to hand me his cell phone to make a thirty-second call to my mother.

10166,arrest,"meeting with my lawyers the next logical step was to meet with my lawyer, shirin ebadi, who had officially been representing me since my arrest in may, although the intelligence ministry had successfully prevented any contact between us."
10167,prisoners,"barely five feet tall, compactly built, she stood with her feet planted firmly on the ground, as if to say, “here i stand; you’re going to have to deal with me.” she had used her nobel prize money to set up the center for the defense of human rights, and along with two other lawyers who also worked pro bono, she represented political prisoners like me."
10168,cell,"as we paced on the sidewalk, since we both knew her office was bugged, she queried me about the conditions of my incarceration, my prison cell, methods of interrogation, questions i had been asked, papers i had signed, how matin-rassekh had dealt with me—all the details important for a human-rights lawyer."
10169,trial,"the intelligence ministry, which had not yet closed my case, could still summon me to trial, and the lien on my mother’s apartment remained in their hands."

10172,where,"at a government registry office where i had some business, the woman clerk behind the desk took one look at me and said in a whisper, “haleh esfandiari!"
10173,cell,we are so proud of you.” a man came over with his cell phone and asked permission to take a picture with me.

10180,evin,in evin i would recite to myself those of his poems my grandmother had taught me or that i had memorized in my youth.
10181,robbery,never mind that you nearly died of fright the night of the robbery and your mother nearly died of fright the night we raided her apartment.
10182,confinement,"we kept you in solitary confinement for 105 days in evin prison, but don’t give that another thought."
10183,bail,so what if we took your mother’s home as bail before we let you go?
10184,trial,we will never close your case; we will leave the threat of indictment and trial hanging over you forever.
10185,bail,we won’t lift the bail on your mother’s apartment.
10186,wall,"i wanted to imprint every detail on my mind: the pink-striped easy chairs, the inlaid wood-carved table father had brought back with him from one of his trips to pakistan, the sofa and cushions covered with persian kilims, the paintings and family pictures on the wall."
10187,power,i knew there would be no return in the foreseeable future for me—not as long as these people were in power.
10188,taken,"we didn’t take the fastest route, avoiding the highway i had taken eight months earlier."
10189,where,"this might be the last time i would see the city where i was born, and which i had always loved."
10190,building,"we passed by tehran university and the azadi tower; i caught a glimpse of the new milad tower, which, when finished, would be tehran’s tallest building."
10191,building,"inside the airport building, there were large crowds, pushing, standing on tiptoes, bouquets in hand waiting for arriving relatives."
10192,where,"we went, as arranged, to a special lounge, where you pay a little extra for expedited customs and passport procedures."
10193,wall,he walked rather alongside me on the other side of a glass wall that separated passengers from non-passengers for the full length of the hall.

10199,national security,"the very government that a year earlier had branded me a spy, an agent of mossad and the cia, an enabler of “soft revolution,” and a threat to national security was inviting me to appear in the same room with the iranian president and perhaps to engage with him in idle chatter as he circulated among his guests."

10204,incarceration,ja’fari was aware i was giving interviews and had written an account of my incarceration for the washington post and had coauthored an essay for the chronicle of higher education.
10205,evin,"i went back to my daily routine at my gym, exercising not in the manic evin way, but in the old way—measured, tempered, and alongside friends."
10206,evin,"i received a poem one of our oldest friends had written for me while i was in evin, “i have a friend there too.” a colleague at the wilson center sent me maya angelou’s “phenomenal woman.” as in tehran, i was stopped in supermarkets, malls, and cafés, on the metro, and on the streets by strangers who recognized me."
10207,question,"even today, the first question i am asked if i am recognized or introduced to someone new is “how is your mother doing?” mother is doing well."
10208,case,"true to form, the islamic republic has not brought closure to my case; nor has it lifted the lien on mutti’s apartment, leaving both hanging like a sword of damocles over my head."
10209,evin,i still have nightmares about evin.
10210,where,i sometimes wake up not knowing where i am.
10211,evin,the birds chirping at five in the morning outside our potomac home bewilder me; i think i am hearing the birds chirping at dawn outside evin prison.
10212,power,"i have discovered that the confidence one once had in the basic stability of things never returns; once experienced, the fear of power-bloated men who think they can do with you what they will is never fully erased."
10213,freedom,"but i have grown wiser and more appreciative not only of the material comforts i unthinkingly enjoy every day—a leisurely cup of coffee, a moment in the sunlight, the reassuring touch of shaul’s hand on mine—but of the freedom with which i am blessed."
10214,law,"i have come to value with every fiber in my body the freedom to speak, think, read, and associate with others; i appreciate as never before the idea of government subject to the rule of law."
10215,freedom,"autocrats and dictators may bring order and stability; but in the end, not answerable to the will of the people or anyone else, they grow reckless, trampling on human freedom and individual rights, wrecking their societies and their countries."
10216,law,"in every talk i have given since my return, i have reminded my audience of these common truths; and i have emphasized the need for all of us to speak out against governments and rulers who consider themselves above the law, who prey on their unprotected citizens."
10217,imprisonment,i was fortunate that my imprisonment captured worldwide attention; i owe my freedom to those who took up my cause.
10218,prisoners,"we need to find more effective ways to be heard and to mobilize international opinion for the many thousands of prisoners of conscience around the world who are imprisoned, terrorized, tortured, and raped, yet have no one to speak for them."

10239,case,"suddenly, having my brother on a different continent seemed like a small price to pay for owning a barbie complete with a carrying case and four outfits, including the rain gear and mini umbrella."
10240,where,"to him, america was a place where anyone, no matter how humble his 3  duma_1400060400_2p_01_r1.k.qxd 11/7/03 3:39 pm page 4  4  firoozeh dumas  background, could become an important person."

10243,where,my father carefully explained that i had attended a prestigious kindergarten where all the children were taught english.
10244,where,"mrs. sandberg then showed everyone, including my mother and me, where iran was on the map."
10245,inside,"the girl’s mother joined us, then gestured for us to follow her inside."
10246,inside,"i assumed that the girl, who appeared to be the same age as i, was a student at leffingwell elementary; having us inside her house was probably akin to having the circus make a personal visit."
10247,situation,"duma_1400060400_2p_01_r1.k.qxd 11/7/03 3:39 pm page 7  funny in farsi  7  her mother handed us a telephone, and my mother, who had, thankfully, memorized my father’s work number, called him and explained our situation."
10248,suspect,"his translations, however, were highly suspect."
10249,where,"we soon discovered that his college years had been spent mainly in the library, where he had managed to avoid contact with all americans except his engineering professors."
10250,war,"somewhere between his thick persian accent and his use of vocabulary found in pre–world war ii british textbooks, my father spoke a private language."
10251,sentence,"even if she did speak a sentence more or less correctly, her accent made it incomprehensible."
10252,sentences,"rather than teach her english vocabulary and grammar, i eventually decided to teach her entire sentences to repeat."
10253,law,"if someone were to ask my father about his proudest moment, he would probably mention the day his nephew muhammad finally bought a house in america, or the day his greatnephew mahan graduated from law school."
10254,poverty,history is full of stories of men overcoming poverty to amass great fortunes in steel or pig farming.
10255,suspect,i suspect it had something to do with the american habit of generously heaping praise and encouragement on anyone who tries anything.
10256,trial,my father gathered the courage to call and was invited to come for a trial run.
10257,trial,“make sure you win.” my father drove the hour-and-a-half round-trip to the burbank studio for the first trial run and returned feeling triumphant.

10259,where,"at one point, we found ourselves near the telephones where one could talk to mickey mouse."
10260,crime,"we knew all the neighbors, everyone looked out for everyone else’s kids, and there was basically no crime other than petty theft."
10261,crimes,"“why are there so many shootings?” in iran, citizens do not have access to guns, so we do not have the types of crimes that so often lead to murders in america."
10262,police,my father was acutely aware of the dangers inherent in our new surroundings and lectured me regularly on the perils of strangers and how i should always go to the police if i ever needed help.
10263,police,"there were no police officers in disneyland, so instead i opted for the young man in the powder blue jumpsuit wearing the hat that resembled an inverted origami boat."

10268,pleaded,“could you just try?” she pleaded.
10269,case,"i clutched closely two helium balloons, items my father prior to this visit had always called a waste of money and never bought for me, a two-foot-long pencil with scenes from disneyland, a complete set of miniature plastic seven dwarves with their own carrying case, and a winnie-the-pooh pencil holder."
10270,where,"on the other hand, if the parents don’t like each other, but the children do, well, this is where sad poetry comes from."

10274,exercise,"uncle nematollah’s next shortcut to svelteness consisted of a specially constructed exercise outfit, advertised during the newlywed game, that promised to help sweat away those pesky pounds."
10275,exercise,"the instructions stated that the outfit had to be worn for twenty minutes before each meal, during which the wearer was supposed to engage in some form of exercise."
10276,state,"the state of euphoria brought on by losing a few pounds soon wore off, accelerated perhaps by the annoying stench of stale sweat emanating from the suit."
10277,exercise,"by attaching the body shaper to a doorknob and lying in the most inconvenient spot possible, the user could exercise one arm or leg, two arms and two legs, one arm and one leg, or any other combination."
10278,where,"well, you go south at the soviet union and there we are.” or we’d try to be more bucolic, mentioning being south of the beautiful caspian sea, “where the famous caviar comes from.” most people in whittier did not know about the famous caviar and once we explained what it was, they’d scrunch up their faces."
10279,question,"any unsuspecting american who asked my father a question received, as a bonus, a lecture on the successful history of the petroleum industry in iran."
10280,where,"from that day, when i told people i was from iran, i added “where persian cats come from.” that impressed them."
10281,where,“where do you keep them?” he asked.
10282,question,"he was very angry once he realized that i had fooled him, but at least he never asked me another question."
10283,sentence,"often kids tried to be funny by chanting, “i ran to i-ran, i ran to i-ran.” the correct pronunciation, i always informed them, is “ee-rahn.” “i ran” is a sentence, i told them, as in “i ran away from my geography lesson.” older boys often asked me to teach them “some bad words in your language.” at first, i politely refused."
10284,question,but almost every person who asked us a question asked with kindness.
10285,war,"if someone had been able to encapsulate the kindness of these second-  duma_1400060400_2p_01_r1.k.qxd 11/7/03 3:39 pm page 35  funny in farsi  35  graders in pill form, the pills would undoubtedly put many war correspondents out of business."
10286,guard,"everyone, from my teachers to the crossing guard to the brownie leader to the neighbors, received something."
10287,where,i had always assumed that she would be relieved to return to her family and to a land where she spoke the language and didn’t need me to act as her interpreter.
10288,guard,"but i realized later that even though my mother could not understand anything the crossing guard, mrs. popkin, said, she understood that this woman looked out for me."
10289,sentences,"but just one of my mother’s signature rambling sentences without a verb (“shop so good very happy at sears”), and our cover was blown."
10290,where,"inevitably, people would ask us where we were from, but our answer didn’t really matter."
10291,where,"where the heck is that?” in 1976, my father’s new job took us to newport beach, a coastal town where everyone is blond and sails."
10292,where,"there, we stood out like a bunch of middle eastern immigrants in a town where everyone is blond and sails."
10293,where,"people rarely asked us where we were from, because in newport beach, the rule of thumb was “if not blond, then mexican.” people would ask me things like “could you please tell lupe that she doesn’t have to clean our house next week, since we’re going to be on vacation.” one would think that the inhabitants of newport beach, a town two hours from the mexican border, would speak at least a few words of spanish."
10294,where,"but in a place where one’s tan is a legitimate topic of conversation (“is that from last weekend at the beach?” “no, i got this playing tennis yesterday”), learning the language of the domestic help is not a priority."
10295,where,all the sixth-graders were herded into the gym where we waited for the nurses to check the curvature in our backs.
10296,taken,"during our stay in newport beach, the iranian revolution took place and a group of americans were taken hostage in the american embassy in tehran."
10297,prisoners,"for some reason, many americans began to think that all iranians, despite outward appearances to the contrary, could at any given moment get angry and take prisoners."
10298,situation,people always asked us what we thought of the hostage situation.
10299,dictatorship,"reactions included “so what do you think of the fascist american cia pigs who supported the shah’s dictatorship only to use him as a puppet in their endless thirst for power in the middle east and other areas like nicaragua?” sometimes, mentioning that i was from iran completely ended the conversation."
10300,question,"my favorite category of question, however, assumed that all iranians were really just one big family: “do you know ali akbari in cincinnati?” people would ask."
10301,camp,"when i was eleven years old, i told my parents i wanted to go to camp."
10302,camp,i cannot remember what possessed me to want to try summer camp.
10303,camp,i’m not sure i even knew what one did at camp.
10304,camp,"but for whatever reason, i made the announcement, and my parents immediately assigned farshid, who was then eighteen, the task of finding the right camp for me."
10305,camp,"after much research, farshid found the “perfect” camp: pine lodge mountain summer camp, located in the mammoth mountains, a mere eight-hour drive from my house."
10306,camp,"my father, whose cultlike devotion to farshid rules out the possibility of questioning any of farshid’s decisions, was very impressed that the camp cost $500 for two weeks."
10307,camp,"the pine lodge brochure also came with a stamp of approval from a camp organization that none of us had ever heard of, but which further impressed my fa-  duma_1400060400_2p_01_r1.k.qxd 11/7/03 3:39 pm page 44  44  firoozeh dumas  ther."
10308,camp,"my mother, as usual, had no comment, although twenty years later, she did say, “i didn’t think you should’ve gone.” after signing up for pine lodge mountain summer camp, i received a list of supplies i would need, none of which we owned."
10309,ward,"the following saturday, my father and i set out for montgomery ward."
10310,camp,"these purchases, coupled with the picture of the smiling girl riding a horse on the camp brochure, left little doubt in my mind that pine lodge mountain summer camp meant nonstop fun and adventure."
10311,camp,"like any other child going to overnight camp for the first time, i immediately regretted my decision."
10312,camp,my father’s stories made one fact abundantly clear: i did not want to go to camp.
10313,question,"“hey, can i ask you a question?” he said."
10314,camp,"hours later, we arrived at camp."
10315,toilet,"oddly, the door to the bathroom had been removed, so any girl who needed to use the toilet or the sink could walk in on someone taking a shower."
10316,camp,"mary and willy were a huge source of comfort to me, not only because they hated pine lodge mountain summer camp as much as i did but because they were the ones whom everyone picked on."
10317,camp,"i skipped the horseback riding, the overnight campout, the archery lessons, the hikes to the indian grounds, and basically every activity outlined in the camp brochure."
10318,chain,every morning i showed up at the macramé station ready to make another key chain.
10319,camp,"at the end of the first week, the counselors announced that the camp would be putting on a play called fiddler on the roof and everyone would have to participate."
10320,suspect,i now suspect that this was a ploy to encourage me to bathe.
10321,camp,"finally, the last day of camp arrived."
10322,camp,"i didn’t have to worry about any emotional good-byes since this was, by far, my happiest day at camp."
10323,camp,"i wondered whether her father would be angry if he’d learned he had spent $1,000 on camp for his kids and they had done nothing but cry."
10324,situation,"didn’t you bathe at all?” all of a sudden, i realized  duma_1400060400_2p_01_r1.k.qxd 11/7/03 3:39 pm page 49  funny in farsi  49  the gravity of the situation."
10325,camp,"having lost my near-invisible camp status, i was overcome with embarrassment and shame."
10326,camp,"during the car ride back, my father asked me if i had enjoyed camp."
10327,camp,"i knew he had sent me to camp expecting $500 worth of fun, and i didn’t have the heart to tell him the truth."
10328,chain,"i don’t know whether my father believed me, but at least i earned a reputation as the best key-chain maker in the family."
10329,where,"to him, denny’s was a clean oasis where the waitresses were always friendly."
10330,where,"we didn’t stop until the next denny’s, where we’d have a snack and my father would say how amazing it was that all denny’s could be so clean, no matter where they were."
10331,jail,"i hated al and always hoped he’d end up in jail, but he, like the decks of cards adorned with pictures of naked women, was a fixture at the stardust."
10332,where,"he never sat at a table where anyone wore a hat, since that was bad luck."
10333,exercise,"the all-you-can-eat buffet, that american phenomenon, represented the only endurance exercise at which my family excelled."
10334,taken,what made las vegas even more awful were my memories of real vacations we had taken in the past.

10611,wall,"no wall space had been overlooked for this decorating opportunity, although i’m sure that even ms. shirley ruth would have found the “leader’s face” theme a bit redundant and could have suggested something with a little more color, perhaps with tassels."
10612,taken,"although a smiling photo would have added much more to the ambiance of any bank, school, or government office, it would have taken away a certain dictatorial edge, and that would have been a real decorating faux pas."
10613,sentence,but anyone who had ever spoken to my mother would have known that the sentence attributed to her in the paper could not have happened.
10614,sentence,"her use of verbs, a trisyllabic adjective, a sentence that could be understood by an english-speaking person—all were dead giveaways that june had, let’s just say, used her imagination."

10631,wall,"hundreds of years from now, archaeologists will study the ancient wall and try to decipher the meaning of the hieroglyphic line."
10632,ordered,"“sit behind your new desk!” he ordered me, trying to conceal the obvious: we had bought a big, ugly desk that was more appropriate for a coroner performing autopsies than for a sixteen-year-old doing math homework."
10633,taken,"without the physical evidence of the fiasco, my father has taken it upon himself to create his own version of the story, a sentimental tale involving father-daughter driving tickets."

10647,illegal,"as soon as one odd duck is found—say, a nudist or someone who thinks paying taxes is illegal—the media has a field day, thus cementing the school’s reputation as “berserkley.” when the unabomber was caught, all the newspapers trumpeted the fact that he had taught at uc berkeley."

10656,case,"i was touched by the hope evident in the descriptions: “has a black patch on his left side, a brown patch on his right leg and answers to ‘big bubba.’” how a random person walking down the street was supposed to look at a skittish cat long enough to notice unique markings was beyond me, but nonetheless, i tried to learn some of the names just in case i ever ran into big bubba, choo choo, or elvira."
10657,where,i told her i knew a great place where she could get a free vegetarian meal.
10658,where,“where are you bleeding?” my roommate asked.
10659,where,"truth was, i had no idea where the bleeding was, but i figured any organ that measures nine feet in length is a good bet."

10670,inside,“the inside is the best!” they told françois.
10671,torture,"motherhood was what every corny cliché promised it would be, with one glaring exception: i have yet to see a coffee mug showing a mother telling her bundle of joy, “i would trade my spleen for another hour of sleep.” it is no wonder that sleep deprivation is a kind of torture."
10672,killing,"by the time my son was two months old, i would have confessed to killing jimmy hoffa if it had brought me more sleep."
10673,where,"public transportation exists where i live, in theory."

10675,building,"she also lived with the singular obsession of feeding me watermelon, since it is “good for breast milk.” even though there was a grocery store across the street from our apartment, our building had no elevator, and maneuvering a watermelon up two flights of stairs was beyond her."
10676,where,“where did this come from?” i asked.
10677,where,"this used to be where the extended family came in—sisters, aunts, cousins helping ease the new mother in to her new role—but that sort of support network has gone the way of manual typewriters."
10678,taken,"i could, at any time during the day or night, be putting clothes in the washing machine, taking clothes out of the washing machine, and putting them in the dryer, folding the ones i had previously taken out of the dryer and deposited in a pile somewhere, or else putting the folded clothes away."

10702,power,"a quick trip to target, and he was the proud owner of power rangers underwear, depicting the various correct colors worn by the characters, with brown not being one of them."
10703,power,"to restore his confidence, i let him in on a secret: “the power is in the underwear.” this led to many days of happy playing at school, until i received a phone call from his teacher, which led to another valuable life lesson: “don’t show your underwear to everyone.” once our television-free month ended, françois admitted that he liked it."
10704,wall,"my children felt this was extra special since nobody else’s grandparents taped artwork on the washing machine and dryer, especially the side facing the wall."
10705,case,"this resulted in her sending me all the goods “in case i changed my mind.” as i’ve gotten older and accepted that i will never win any argument with my mother, i listen and meekly agree with everything she says."
10706,question,"everywhere they went, they managed to buy the kind of souvenirs that beg the question “who would buy this?”—from singapore, a bouquet of plastic orchids; from japan, a clown with the word “tokyo” on its distended belly; from london, an umbrella with the phrase “fresh as a daisy” written all around the edge."
10707,where,"the idea of celebrating marriage anniversaries was completely foreign to my family, since most marriages were arranged and did not come with the requisite romantic story of how we met and where we went on our first date and the first time we kissed."
10708,case,"it the case of my mother, she was passing the gifts to me, the original giver."
10709,wall,i now have to decide which of my friends is worthy of the “as seen on tv” garnishing set that i gave my mother sometime before the fall of the berlin wall.

10715,guilt,"“that’s my mother.” growing up, i assumed all parents used guilt as one of the key pillars of parenting."
10716,guilt,it is entirely possible that his serve is nothing more than guilt redirected.
10717,guilt,"i had always been familiar with guilt and its powers, but never more acutely than during my high school years."
10718,question,living on our own was out of the question.
10719,guilt,"i knew all this, and felt the guilt, but i was fifteen and really wanted to spend the night at mary ann’s so we could discuss all the boys we liked, and try to figure out why they never, ever liked us back."
10720,guilt,the guilt scenario was always the same.
10721,crime,"given that i didn’t smoke or drink, always got good grades, and hung out with an oddly responsible crowd whose worst crime was baking too much, i found my mother’s excessive worrying to be beyond annoying, but i still felt terribly guilty."
10722,where,"but i just couldn’t help wanting to go to mary ann’s or carolyn’s or carol’s or karen’s or ruthie’s or susan’s, where things were always rosier than at my house."
10723,guilt,"despite my mother’s guilt, i still managed to live a life, at least on the outside, that did not look too different from that of my american friends."
10724,guilt,"the guilt was like a ball and chain that wasn’t quite heavy enough to keep me back, but loud enough that i could always hear it clanging."
10725,guilt,i realized years later that my mother’s use of guilt was her way of trying to corral me within the confines of her world.
10726,guilt,"the frenchman, untrained in the ways of guilt, had eliminated any possible out."
10727,guilt,"“i loook all over for you,” she told us, cementing the guilt."
10728,wall,i remembered reading that one of the astronauts claimed that the great wall of china was the only man-made object visible from outer space.
10729,guilt,"“we’ll never hear the end of it.” it was clear that when it came to guilt, his catholic background had ill prepared him, regardless of claims otherwise."
10730,gate,"we came up with many possible scenarios, from the neighbor’s dog mauling it to blueberries staining it to losing it while on a picnic in golden gate park."
10731,guilt,we decided to wash it so many times that it would fade and then we could donate it guilt-free to a homeless person.
10732,where,"she had, after all, brought me a chanel purse on their last trip to iran, where, apparently, the people who stitched the tag were in a hurry and forgot the h, thus giving me the popular quilted “canel” bag."
10733,taken,"we decided to take our time finding just the right one, meanwhile enjoying the absence of it, which had taken our bedroom hostage for six months with its screaming color."
10734,wall,this was an ace that ricocheted off the back wall and hit me in the head.
10735,where,"meanwhile, the comforter had circled to where we were standing."
10736,guilt,"i tried to make small talk, but the guilt in the car was suffocating us."
10737,law,"it’s the law!” i wrote, making the exclamation points extra big to let everyone know i meant business."
10738,guilty,these dogs looked guilty.
10739,death,"this was the first time i had used the look of death glaring technique, ever."
10740,power,"the power i felt in the red fleece suit, combined with the hands on the hips, had turned me into a suburban superhero, super bitch."
10741,where,"about a month later, our local paper announced that the elementary school where my children attended had finally found a new principal."
10742,where,i looked at the picture of the new principal and knew that i had seen her somewhere but could not remember where.
10743,case,"the next morning i opened the blinds, and it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, or in this case, excrement."
10744,guilty,"there was the new principal, walking her two medium-size dogs, which suddenly no longer looked guilty at all."
10745,building,"now that the three of them are no longer burdened by the demands of their respective engineering and medical careers, they somehow have to fill up the time previously spent building oil refineries and healing the sick."
10746,case,doesn’t he remind you of hassani?” the price is right is based essentially on the ability to guess the price of a ceiling fan or a case of men’s hair color.
10747,taken,"but like the college students who somehow managed to turn the bob newhart show into a drinking game, my father and his brothers have taken the show to a whole new level."
10748,power,"it’s a show that allows the three brothers to act as god, while yielding no real power whatsoever."
10749,law,"uncle abdullah’s son mehdi and his daughter-in-law mary flew from italy several times, their son darius came from rwanda, my cousin ryan from new york."
10750,death,my uncle had lived a very full life; his death was not unexpected.
10751,death,jackie kennedy’s stoicism after the death of her husband would not have translated well in the middle east.
10752,death,"in the united states, the ability to “move on” after a death is usually seen as a sign of inner strength and generally commended."
10753,death,it would be unimaginable to have any celebration so close to the death of a parent.
10754,question,"his attention to detail was legendary, as was his talent for giving really long answers to just about any question."
10755,case,but i also remember my uncle as someone with a severe case of directional dyslexia.
10756,law,"he and his american wife, julie, née julie, had put together a slide show of my uncle’s life, set to beatles music: the stern wedding portrait showing him and my aunt far too young to be getting married; still baby-faced but now holding their own babies; images of trips to the caspian sea with their sons, all knobby knees and spindly arms; mahmood on a wobbly tricycle; weddings with smiling daughters-in-law, the same ones who had held uncle abdullah’s hand for the past six months; grandchildren of all ages, each one of them knowing what it’s like to be loved; snapshots of everyone in hawaii wearing leis, wrinkle-free faces not fully appreciated at the time; college graduations of those longago babies; more wrinkled faces; my aunt and uncle all dressed up in front of the stardust in las vegas with smiles that said, “it’s a long way from abadan!” my uncle wearing seventies sunglasses, long sideburns, and more wrinkles; and finally the photos taken during the last year, his body looking frail and tired, knowing the end is near but still smiling, testimony that where we begin does not determine where we end."
10757,case,"he was never without a book, and everyone knew that lending him any book meant kissing that book goodbye for at least a year, sometimes three in the case of gorky park or anything by james michener."
10758,freedom,"like so many immigrants before us, we found not only what we wanted but a few things we didn’t even know we were looking for: girl scouts, freedom of speech, affordable community colleges, guacamole, public libraries, clean bathrooms, the pursuit of happiness, and loehman’s."
10759,where,the realm of gastronomy represents the only area where i deliberately seek adventure.
10760,case,"the old saying that we shouldn’t judge someone without walking in their boots would be difficult in the case of the maasai, who are famously known for walking barefoot."
10761,serving,"then there’s the matter of splitting the head, cooking it, and serving it to guests, all of whom should know what is coming their way."
10762,crime,serving kaleh pacheh to an unsuspecting guest should be categorized as a crime.
10763,where,it’s like listening to a band where one hears only the drums.
10764,case,"i know that one cannot claim to dislike a food without having tried several versions of it, but in this case i make an exception."
10765,abuse,the food was so good that a little bit of abuse seemed a small price to pay for a perfect coq au vin.
10766,ordered,"during one of our excursions, our son ordered a salmon dish, which he did not like."
10767,ordered,my husband and daughter ordered it; my son and i ordered different dishes so we could all share.
10768,serving,"“sure,” she said, giving me a generous serving."
10769,where,this is the point where good judgment flew out the window.
10770,taken,my thirteen-year-old had also taken a bite of andouillette and was now gulping down several glasses of water.
10771,law,"when we explained why we all felt sick and wouldn’t be able to eat, my mother-in-law asked if the andouillette had smelled bad, sort of like a toilet."
10772,law,maybe my mother-in-law was wrong.
10773,taken,it’s better to achieve success later and have it be real than to become famous and have it taken away.
10774,where,"i showed it to the woman next to me, who looked impressed and then asked me if i knew where to find lemon basil."
10775,death,"everyone knows that a high starting bid on ebay is the kiss of death, so we settled on five dollars."
10776,where,"we also had to decide on the categories for ebay where our item would be listed, so we went with “religion” and “totally bizarre.” i should have looked at the latter before committing to it since i soon discovered that it contains mainly naked pictures of ex-girlfriends."
10777,case,"nonetheless, i kept the potato just in case i ever came across an ad reading, “looking for cross-shaped potato."
10778,where,"i am, however, grateful for people who choose to spend their holidays on those floating behemoths, since all those people will not be vacationing where i go."
10779,case,"these idyllic destinations, scattered in the mediterranean like easter eggs waiting to be found, evoked such a severe case of wanderlust that i had to sit down on the sofa and stare into space for a considerable amount of time, effectively tuning out the steady chorus of “mom, what’s for dinner?” i was overcome by images of fishing villages with whitewashed houses, hills bursting with fig trees and grapevines, and close-ups of fresh seafood platters that made me swoon."
10780,taken,"it had taken them a while to maneuver their way, like bumper cars, down the narrow hallways."
10781,where,i wouldn’t have known where to begin.
10782,sink,it was worth it.” my dad let my words of courage sink in.
10783,where,"where she went, i went."
10784,charged,"our “european” look put my mother and me a couple of rungs higher on the social ladder, but it also meant that my mother, often mistaken for a farangi, or foreigner, was often charged more."
10785,situation,"“bebakhsheed, i am so sorry,” she said, “but what was in the box is no longer available.” my mother called my father and explained the situation."
10786,power,"“during the time i spent down there,” she continued, “i introduced the children to the power of visualization."
10787,sentences,"luckily, she had taken so long to utter her three sentences that there was no time for the rest of us to speak."
10788,where,"“excuse me,” i said, “where are the rest of the books?” “that’s it, honey,” the lady at the cashier said."
10789,where,"“hey, foroozi, how ’bout you buy my cd set and i buy one of your books?” my book could double as a doorstop, where as his cds, which cost four times as much as my book, had no use whatsoever."
10790,guard,"“can you write in it, ‘hold on tight to those dreams and never, ever let go!’” i did what i was told and even added a waving smiley face, like the one i had learned back in second grade from my crossing guard, mrs. popkin."
10791,freedom,"i’m all for consumer freedom, but i don’t see the freedom when there are no alternatives."
10792,where,where did it go?
10793,where,"in a country where women are told they can be anything they want to be, popular culture tells them that the lower that bar is set, the cooler you are."
10794,law,my sister-in-law was raised in iran and came to america only a few years ago.
10795,freedom,having freedom does not automatically mean we all make good choices.
10796,freedom,freedom is a rope; some make a ladder out of it and climb out of the box they’re put in; some make a noose; and others make a stripper’s pole.
10797,case,"overcome with relief that such was no longer the case, i realized that for the most part, life only gets better, even if we never look quite as good in short pleated skirts as we did in high school."
10798,illegal,"it feels really good and it’s not illegal, immoral, or fattening—although i believe the dumplings were."
10799,jails,"as i speak, there are people languishing in jails around the world."
10800,guilty,they are guilty of wanting democracy in countries where citizens have no voice.
10801,freedom,even if you don’t think your vote makes a difference—which it does—vote in honor of those who risk their lives to have the freedom you have.
10802,where,"you will eventually end up where you want to be, even if right now you have no idea where that might be."
10803,injustice,"while i was growing up, my father told me a thousand times that the greatest injustice was his older sister sedigeh’s having to quit school at fourteen to get married."
10804,crime,"he always said that to deny someone an education is not just a crime but a sin, because you are denying that person the opportunity to realize who he or she is meant to be."
10805,freed,"every day, my family and i watched the news religiously, hoping to hear that the american hostages had been freed from the american embassy in tehran."
10806,situation,"he was, thanks to the iranian revolution, unemployed and, thanks to the hostage situation, unemployable."
10807,freed,we were sure the hostages would be freed by thanksgiving.
10808,freed,we hoped they would be freed by christmas.
10809,situation,it was amazing to me that some people were profiting from the hostage situation by making hateful bumper stickers.
10810,captive,forget that king cyrus is mentioned many times in the old testament for freeing the captive jews from the babylonians.
10811,state,"in the fall of 2007, i was invited to speak in her neighboring state of wisconsin."
10812,state,"it was my first visit to the dairy state, where i learned, among other things, that schools and prisons in wisconsin are required to serve real butter, not margarine."
10813,incarcerated,"should i ever find myself incarcerated, may it be in wisconsin."
10814,captivity,i figured anyone who managed to make donuts while in captivity in the american embassy in tehran would appreciate a cookbook.
10815,state,"during the course of our e-mail correspondence, kathryn had asked me if i wanted her to show me her home state of iowa."
10816,where,"we left the next morning at 6:00 am sharp to drive to dubuque, where another one of kathryn’s relatives, gail, was arriving on a steamboat."
10817,where,"we toured the boat, chatted with kathryn’s cousin and her friends, and then headed for dyersville, where kathryn wanted to show me the farm toy museum and the field of dreams."
10818,war,almost everyone who advocates war with iran has never been there.
10819,war,i assume the number one rule in war is “don’t get to know the enemy.” glimpses of shared humanity make it so hard to kill others.
10820,taken,kathryn told me about all the delicious meals she ate in iran during the three and a half months she was there before being taken hostage.
10821,where,"where i live, i’m used to hearing my neighbor’s conversations with the gardener, the beeping of the automatic car locks, or basically every word uttered in the summer when the windows are open."
10822,where,now i know where to go never to hear my neighbors again.
10823,roads,we drove what looked like the same serene roads we had been driving earlier.
10824,where,we went into a couple of stores where i bought black walnuts; kathryn bought a jar of canned beef.
10825,county,"on our way to our next destination, driving along a singlelane county road, we saw a group of amish children returning from school, two by two."
10826,where,"we soon crossed the wapsipinicon river to jesup, where kathryn had grown up."
10827,stretch,"on that long stretch of straight road, we suddenly heard a siren."
10828,suspect,"i’m from iran.” i’m sure that was the first time the officer had heard that excuse, but i suspect he already knew kathryn."
10829,where,"waterloo is john deere country, where those yellow and green tractors are manufactured."
10830,building,"after showing me the university of northern iowa, in cedar falls, kathryn drove us to her home, a charming, well-maintained two-story building with a cross on the front door."
10831,inside,"inside, the house was full of books and artifacts from kathryn’s travels to africa, europe, and iran."
10832,where,"the next day, we walked a few blocks to the college where kathryn teaches."
10833,where,perhaps it was obvious where i came from.
10834,taken,"i have spoken at many rotary club meetings so i had an idea of what to expect, but that day, i was taken by surprise."
10835,where,"the next day, kathryn took me to the farm south of jesup, in a community called jubilee, where she had grown up."
10836,war,"until the end of world war ii, jubilee had a grocery store, a creamery, a blacksmith’s, a butcher shop, a post office, and, of course, a church."
10837,captivity,"for kathryn, it was the words in the bible that had helped her endure 444 days of captivity and let go of her justifiable anger."
10838,where,"ultimately, it doesn’t matter where we learn that lesson."
10839,power,"to all the teachers and librarians who still believe in the power of books, god bless you!"
10840,term,"they have heard me speak more times than is healthy, and i apologize for any long-term effects they may experience."
10841,where,"i caught myself smiling and then realized that i was thinking about an old iranian saying: “jana sokhan az zabane ma migooi.” “dear, you speak from my heart!” the truth is that neither of us considers our world merely a personal space where the slightest discord might bring discontent."
10842,court,"neither is this world of ours a public court of law where we sit in judgment of others’ private tragedies; we are only observing the illusive world of everyday life through multiple lenses, hoping to bring some sense to it through reflection and analysis."
10843,question,"this is in fact the account of the experience of a psychoanalyst working in today’s tehran, an account that continues to grow on you, gets you to know her as an analyst, surprises you, and makes you question your own presuppositions."
10844,where,"as the title doing psychoanalysis in tehran implies, what you are about to encounter is an attempt to write in the format of a psychoanalytic session; an “ideal” psychoanalytic session where both analytic subjects, analyst and analysand, have the courage to face the chaos of their unconscious, to come face to face with the stranger within themselves, and to learn to bear the anxiety of participating in the unknown."
10845,question,"certainly, there always remains the question of how free one’s free associations actually are."
10846,where,"these pages are nothing but my fantasies and my fantasies alone (not that anyone can get away from doing anything else), where i once again indulge in the challenge of coming face to face with my own unconscious."
10847,case,xviii  i have almost caused disappointment by presenting case materials that are similar to those of patients in boston or new york.
10848,term,"these reactions could also be characterized as a form of “orientalism,” to borrow edward said’s term."
10849,where,where the oedipal complex is played out according to very different parameters than in the west .
10850,repression,"the symbolic order—or rather what replaces it, a rigid structure reminiscent of mechanical solidarity superimposed upon the greatest civilization of all time, which went under repression along with their desirous men—is the backdrop for the child of what regulates the all-powerful desire of the mother ."
10851,term,"this is why the postmodern definitions of femininity and body feel to me problematic, since there is no direct indictment of the patriarchal order, since there is none in the western sense of the term."
10852,prisoners,do any prisoners get psych treatments?
10853,prisoners,have any of your patients been political prisoners?
10854,death,"the “worrying strangeness” can never compete with the fear and the anxiety of facing our unconscious, our femininity, or with the fear of facing death."
10855,death,"the worrying strangeness is closely related to the childish fear of the other: the other in the form of death, the other in the form of woman, and the other in the form of our own uncontrollable drives ."
10856,question,"according to kristeva, living with the other is living with this question: “am i the other?” or, as the french poet rimbaud puts it: “i is an other.” kristeva wonders why we call foreigners “aliens,” alien being anything entirely other to the status quo."
10857,inside,"i cannot deal with you, “the alien,” just as i cannot deal with the alien inside me."
10858,case,"i was interviewed for the italian psychoanalytic journal psyche, and although in this case the interviewer was a lot more in touch with the alien within herself, and treated psychoanalysis in iran with a much more open mind than the other examples i have given, there were still certain questions  preface  xxv  she asked, and a certain manner in which she asked them, that reinforce the point we have been discussing thus far."
10859,taken,"people here are very much into talking, talking, and talking; and so the talking cure has found itself taken to the heart of the iranian national character.” i am not ignoring the importance of cultural difference, yet neither can we ignore the fact that human beings are a lot more similar than they are different, that pain is pain and whenever we feel differently, we must look for the stranger within."
10860,where,"as it is, i cannot understand where the anguish, the nervousness, and the lack of confidence come from."
10861,freedom,(at least it seemed easier at the time to have the illusion of freedom.
10862,freedom,"what will i do with this freedom, and why is it so terrifying?"
10863,authority,"now i had been given the subjectivity i had wanted in the form of a doctorate and certification as an analyst, but my titles brought a great deal more upon me than the usual authority accompanied by such degrees."
10864,freedom,"a country stigmatized by the world for its violations of human rights, its lack of democracy, its nuclear ambitions, and its lack of freedom of speech."
10865,inside,"they hold the many voices and ghosts of analysts past inside them; they are my analytic organ, as julia kristeva would say."
10866,question,"eventually i fell into a depression seven years ago and it broke me inside.” she starts crying and wonders: “how come you make me cry so easily, little girl?” having faced my silence to her question, she responds to her own question with two dreams."
10867,disaster,she tells me that her recurring dream consists of being told that she has to get all her stuff together because of some form of disaster.
10868,case,"both her arms have a strange twist to them, and i know right away that this is a severe case of arthritis."
10869,taken,"arthritis has shown her no mercy; it has slowly taken over her professional organs, and she is not capable of easily handing me the thing that has been so abruptly and severely taken away from her."
10870,guilt,"the worst is the torment that accompanies me, joined by severe guilt after my hysterical episodes."
10871,charged,"i have a mischievous smile now; there is nothing like bringing up the fee to clarify any misunderstandings about who is in charge, and who is going to be charged."
10872,abuse,"how i abuse him, as a master (everyone knows that it is not only slaves who are abused by masters)."
10873,inside,"in an interview about her novel the samurai, julia kristeva wisely elaborates: “none of the characters in the samurai could say that hell is other people, for hell is inside of us."
10874,question,"neither can they ask the question, ‘should we burn sade?’ for sade is burning inside of us.” if we share, as i do, kristeva’s freudian position, then we can infer this: is it not my very own banality, burning inside of me, that has paved the way for my deep rejection of banality?"
10875,death,"it strikes me now as evening fills my soul that the tiger addressed in my poem is a shadowy beast, a tiger of symbols and scraps picked up at random out of books, a string of labored tropes that have no life, and not the fated tiger, the deadly jewel that under sun or stars or changing moon goes on in bengal or sumatra fulfilling its rounds of love and indolence and death."
10876,escaped,"sabina and her hats aroused my curiosity, but it was tereza’s fierce loyalty and the image of her two big suitcases that has never escaped me."
10877,question,"the shaky existence of meaning is the key question, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness the key dichotomy, of the unbearable lightness of being."
10878,death,"from a psychoanalytic perspective, this is the duality of life and death; lightness versus heaviness; eros and thanatos; this is, precisely, one of the chief struggles of the human condition."
10879,state,he tells us about how these characters struggle in vain to obtain a state that is not totally unbearable.
10880,where,"and so in erotic relations we find a less narcissistic subject, with more awareness of the other, as opposed to pure sexuality, where the individual is absolutely unaware of the object."
10881,torture,"tomas’s behavior comes at the high price of continuous torture for his wife tereza, a simple waitress from the countryside who loves him with fierce devotion and loyalty."
10882,case,"accepting one’s castration is what is considered the cure for neurotics in psychoanalysis, but it seems that tereza, like a specific group of our neurotic women patients, has confused submitting to one’s castration with submission to the other—in her case to tomas, her husband."
10883,crimes,"tomas writes an article, condemning communist leaders’ claim that they “did not know” atrocious crimes were happening at the time, that they only adhered to the communist ideology, as though if they did not know, they should be redeemed."
10884,punishment,"upon arriving in tehran  27  from a psychoanalytic perspective we can read that tomas is himself the oedipus of his article, guilt-ridden by crimes he has unconsciously committed, and feels that the only way of redeeming himself is by receiving punishment."
10885,punishment,tomas’s unconscious need for punishment becomes clear throughout the book.
10886,case,let us suppose that such is the case that somewhere in the world each of us has a partner who once formed part of our body.
10887,where,"he leaps out of the window, but she tells him bitterly to stay where he feels happy, making those abrupt, angular movements that so annoyed and displeased him."
10888,case,"nowhere in the entire novel are we left with the same unshakable sense of the unbearable lightness of being as when karenin is brought to his death at the hands of his loved ones, for as kundera tells us:  upon arriving in tehran  30  dogs do not have many advantages over people, but one of them is extremely important: euthanasia is not forbidden by law in their case; animals have the right to a merciful death."
10889,where,"stefano bolognini, an italian psychoanalyst, has a paper on the relationship between man and his dog, entitled “if dogs don’t go to paradise, i want to go where they go.” i believe that kundera, like bolognini, has intuitively understood what it really means to have had a dog and to have lost one."
10890,power,"this is the kundera we hear in the chapter on karenin’s smile, a kundera who says: true human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power."
10891,death,"without him they cannot exist, so shortly after karenin’s death the unbearable lightness of being becomes too unbearable for tomas and tereza, and they also are killed in a car accident."
10892,death,"meanwhile she, in america, is experiencing a sort of psychic death, and that existential human crisis, our inevitable death, is precisely why we are doomed to encounter the unbearable lightness of being."
10893,taken,"all of the above analysis of the unbearable lightness of being taken into account, what i remember the most is reading the last few pages of the book compulsively, over and  upon arriving in tehran  33  over again."
10894,abuse,"you see, i do abuse kundera and, my memory informs me, i have done for many years."
10895,case,"quite shaken by what he has just heard, my father responds: “but i am the translator of his works into farsi!” he continues: “in any case, this is my phone number, and my room number at my hotel."
10896,inside,"i am sweating, and my heartbeat is so fast now that i can hear it inside my head."
10897,sentence,his last sentence lifts all my anxiety; all my worries are translated into pure joy and ecstasy.
10898,murder,"lacan, following saussure, has written that “the symbol manifests itself first as the murder of the thing.” here he is referring to the self-effacing nature of language, which essentially distorts that which it is attempting to clarify."
10899,power,"lacan writes: “the symbol manifests itself first of all as the murder of the thing, and this constitutes in the subject the externalization of his desire.” if i want to put it simply, it was not only the actual words my father verbalized that had such an enormous power over me: they were fueled with power because of who they were coming from and for whom they were intended, and because of the emotional relationship between the two subjects."
10900,where,"nostalgia is the territory of the homeland, of where you started from; the audience desperately wants odysseus home, near his familiar olive tree, where faithful penelope has been waiting for him all these years."
10901,where,"that, i believe, is one of the most disillusioning, painful realizations of the human condition: finding that one does not even belong where one is supposed to belong."
10902,state,"it is about how we disguise ourselves behind these various roles, and the enslavement that accompanies such a state."
10903,state,"in other words, human beings are in a perpetual state of feeling like frauds, under the illusion that they are fooling themselves and the other."
10904,taken,i was taken by surprise.
10905,freedom,"i had understood camus’s vision of sisyphus, and i was able to tolerate it; i was able to experience freedom and subjectivity because of it."
10906,where,so where did all this intellectual discourse evaporate to?
10907,where,"how i had fantasized about my great return, when i would feel i belonged; my return to where people spoke my language, in the broader sense of the word."
10908,where,"i was home, to live where i had lived before; i had finally arrived at my version of the olive tree."
10909,state,"i was furious at tehran for keeping me in a state of longing all these years, only to end up disappointing me."
10910,state,"i find ordinary people so much more interesting.” instead of directly reporting on the history of my relationship with professor s, i will ask you to discover the past through my account of its present state."
10911,where,"i saw him for the last time in his office, a space that embodied within it the remembrance of times past; where i had entered years back, a very different person to the one i am today."
10912,where,"where i had cried in front of him time after time, where i had learned from him, where he had become the only person in my life who had not invested in my passivity nor my femininity, where he had patiently and slowly shown me the roads toward subjectivity, where we had colluded together against the whole world when it was absolutely necessary, speaking only my mother tongue, even though i could only bear to use the lexicon of a second language."
10913,where,"professor s had become my version of the olive tree away from my olive tree, and his office my transitional space, where i had found the safety and containment needed for any child to grow up."
10914,where,"unlike the usual people lulling us with various illusions, professor s always reminded me that you can’t erase any kind of misery,  upon arriving in tehran  49  but you can find out where it comes from through an investigation."
10915,taken,"that day i thought i was going to get into trouble for all my sins, including the colorful little soaps my brother and i had taken from a store when we were little kids."
10916,where,where else but professor s’s office?
10917,where,"it was a room of our own, where the compulsion to confess was always right with me."
10918,guilty,"he listened attentively and said: “gohar, you are very guilty of many sins, especially of having had oedipal, pre-oedipal, and many other vicious fantasies."
10919,question,upon arriving in tehran  54  does that answer your question?
10920,death,"it seems iranians tend to eroticize death, mourning, sadness, and depression, encapsulated in rain."
10921,killing,"greek mythology seems to be populated with myths about killing fathers, while it is impossible to escape the common pattern of killing sons all over iranian mythology."
10922,power,"i am convinced of the universality of the oedipus complex, and the struggle for power and control it represents while embodying within itself the universal fear of castration; however, the culturally specific element seems to be the reaction to this fear."
10923,case,"hence, within the history of iran, we can again see the demand for absolute obedience as a reaction formation to the anxiety of the potential rebelliousness of the culture (in this case the sons)."
10924,power,"meanwhile, greek culture seems to be about taking over and substituting power, the collective fantasy allowing deviation from and elimination of the father in response to the fear of castration, in order to gain power and control."
10925,police,"this means essentially that laws in iran are followed as long as the police, the law, and the father are present."
10926,imprisoned,"we destroyed our future and imprisoned ourselves in the past, eroticizing pain and suffering, and celebrating nothing that is not past."
10927,taken,"we never properly mourned the loss of our glorious past, before it was taken over by islam."
10928,where,"upon arriving in tehran  57  daryoush shaygan informs us that the iranian past is full of myths and epics represented in the shahnameh, where there are continual allusions to the good attitude of our ancestors, the beliefs and actions of our heroes, and the myths of our great kings."
10929,where,"at the risk of disturbing the londoner, i have to confess that i found the sun depressing this morning; the brightness of the tehranian sun would not allow me to escape where i was, for it immediately reminded me of where i had landed."
10930,guilt,"the experience of guilt caused by not appreciating the sun brings me back to my session with ms. n, who had started it by telling me: “because of my arthritis i had to go to the hospital a few months ago."
10931,case,"ok, they were on my case all the time; they would not allow me five minutes of calm to read my book, but i felt more  upon arriving in tehran  58  alive in that hospital room in tehran than i have felt in the most beautiful, luxurious hotels in the world."
10932,guilty,"you know our people: iranians have a lot of faults, but we are soft, the absolute opposite of french people.” i found myself feeling a great deal of guilt, but what had i done to feel guilty about?"
10933,guilty,was i feeling guilty because i did not find people particularly soft in my homeland?
10934,where,where has all my steadfast love for my country gone?
10935,taken,"what am i to do with this new knowledge about myself: the mirage that has been taken away from me, while behind it i had to come face to face with myself as an absolutely nonpatriotic citizen?"
10936,guilty,are we bound to feel guilty if we are not absolutely enchanted with our homelands?
10937,torture,"are we to torture ourselves because we have, in a sense, left the motherland, and we can never quite go back?"
10938,guilt,"it seems we are destined to suffer guilt if we have become incapable of seeing our motherland as flawless, and have recognized that our paradise is nowhere to be found, especially not in our homeland, and that our paradise is forever lost."
10939,building,ms. n continues: “let me give you an example: i lived in my apartment building in paris for twenty-three years; not even once did one of my neighbors knock on my door.
10940,where,"i always thought about the horror of one of our bodies rotting for months in an empty apartment, where it would start to reek like a corpse: the body surrounded by insects, each taking little pieces to feed themselves."
10941,building,"until the disgusting odor would lead to someone remembering: ‘oh, there are  upon arriving in tehran  61  other people in this building.’ yes, only through the death of a neighbor would we be reminded that once upon a time they existed, that they were alive."
10942,where,"it was as if all these years of punctuality, hard work, and immaculate organization were vehicles to deliver me to this desired destination, where half of my time was spent entertaining one of my neighbors who would show up unannounced, bringing me sweets, food, or fruits from a grandfather’s village, and the rest of my time was taken up with thinking about putting something in their now empty pots, plates, and baskets and knocking on their doors unannounced to return their kindheartedness."
10943,where,"i want to say: “listen, ms. n. ok, there are things that don’t work in the west, but do you consider the east a place where things are functioning?"
10944,where,"oh please; look at india, where all the yogis in the world are not able to stop hunger."
10945,where,"no, they are not working.” i do not want to stop here: i want to say to ms. n: “do you know what happened to me yesterday?” yesterday i found myself in a famous psychiatric hospital in tehran, where i was really impressed and, i have to admit,  upon arriving in tehran  64  surprised by the degree of organization i observed."
10946,case,"having heard of his reputation, i take my case to him and demand a letter on behalf of my chubby patient and her silent little girl."
10947,question,"have him stay in the house and beat me up all day and night?” the doctor of the legends of tehran responds to the chubby woman’s very legitimate question: “you know,  upon arriving in tehran  66  my child, we should both have been born in sweden; under those conditions we would be talking to each other on completely different terms.” i feel like an outsider; they seem to understand each other’s language, while for me they might as well be speaking swedish."
10948,poverty,"“he has a very unique sense of humor and makes his money doing intellectual work, which, as everybody knows, is a path toward poverty!"
10949,taken,"“‘the crucial thing is to be authentic: be who you are, for everybody else is already taken."
10950,prisoner,"and if you do not act upon your own desire, you are bound to be a prisoner; the only variable is who your prison guard is."
10951,guard,"one day your prison guard enforces lipstick as the enemy, while another day the guard informs you that all intellectuals must wear red lipstick."
10952,inside,"“‘do not categorize people as nonintellectuals because they drive expensive cars; this is only about the lack, the void, the stupidity you feel inside, which you project onto them."
10953,roads,"i have begun to despise the intellectuals of this city; they feel as if they cannot walk on the sidewalk like everybody else, they  upon arriving in tehran  70  have to walk through the dirtiest, most difficult of roads and come out smelling like sweat in their old shoes."
10954,escaped,"if only we could figure out how they escaped the poisonous venom of banality, we might be able to make an antidote for the disease; we might be able to save people from banality?” “mr."
10955,question,"she quickly replies: “after many years of thinking about this question, i have found one difference between those i categorize as banal and those who are not banal: non-banal people like myself have taken their destiny by the balls and into their own hands; we have assumed subjectivity; we do not believe things happen to us; we consider ourselves  upon arriving in tehran  74  responsible for the consequences of our actions; we are not victims, we choose, we have consciousness."
10956,justice,and i can never do justice with mere words to what it is like to visit shiraz in spring.
10957,taken,in spring shiraz is taken over by the perfume of orange blossom.
10958,death,"maybe i find it depressing because through spring, we are forced to face everything that represents life, birth, youth, while we are so intensely aware of getting older, and approaching death."
10959,death,"you know that simone de beauvoir remarks: ‘it is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life."
10960,death,"old age is life’s parody, whereas  upon arriving in tehran  76  death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension."
10961,death,"death does away with time.’ and so, because of spring’s inevitable association to life, one cannot escape its absolute contrast, old age."
10962,guilt,"as ms. n is about to leave (perhaps she knows at some level what she has communicated, and that indeed the message has got to the receiver), with what i perceive to be some degree of guilt, and in order, i believe, to repair the relationship, she hands me a small delicate lily of the valley  upon arriving in tehran  78  from her big yellow bag and says: “i forgot i had brought this for you, i picked it from my own garden.” perplexed at what has just happened, without much contemplation, i say “thank you,” as ms. n leaves my office for that day."
10963,situation,the situation leaves itself open to various other refined modes of investigation.
10964,situation,perhaps in order to transform a bloody situation of disappointment into a flowery condition of hope; as a vehicle to eliminate the anxiety of the former situation.
10965,freedom,it carries with it a lack of consciousness and of freedom.
10966,question,"upon arriving in tehran  82  something else is also imposing itself on my line of associations: “culture.” i have in my analytic career found it easy to reject and question my patients’ gifts, letters, demands to look at their photos, etc."
10967,case,"each time i thought about what should be done according to the specificity of the case and acted appropriately, always staying faithful to understanding what the meaning behind such an act might be, and trying to hear the message that the patient wanted to communicate through the act."
10968,inside,"meaning, for him, was not primarily inside or outside, but in constant flux between the two."
10969,where,"i do not even know what i just said signifies, but what comes to mind is paintings; you know i live and breathe paintings, they are where i experience the utmost pleasure and ecstasy."
10970,torture,"for me pleasure comes from painting, and the unique form of suffering i am willing to endure is the torture of creativity."
10971,situation,"thankfully my knowledge of psychoanalysis allows me to distance myself from the situation, and not to let our  upon arriving in tehran  87  interpersonal dynamics turn me into the cruel and sadistic mother she has previously unconsciously depicted."
10972,disaster,"it seems to me that ms. n is not equipped (or properly dressed) to separate from the object against the backdrop of a calm sea; separation as reported in her dream is the aftermath of a disaster followed by severe anxiety, devastating stormy seas, and no proper clothing."
10973,conviction,"i am tempted to try to calm the sea represented by the format of our session, but i have a pretty firm conviction that we must go through this process together, that i have  upon arriving in tehran  88  to tolerate the parting and separation on a very stormy note, to feel exactly how it feels to be ms. n, to identify then empathize with her, and to show her i can tolerate and contain these torturous feelings."
10974,question,"on that note, i respond to her question about whether i know much about art or whether i am a mere “symbolic communications” junky."
10975,situation,i must have done something wrong.” ms. n replies: “i admire your ability to take responsibility for the current sharp and knifelike situation we are in; you are not as flowery as you look after all.” after ms. n’s departure i am unable to get her out of my mind.
10976,tortured,was she letting me know about her tortured self through the image of a tortured christ betrayed and crucified for other people’s sins?
10977,where,"it does not come as a surprise that the thought of separation leads my associations to my own mother, for can any of us be reminded of separation without thinking of separation from our mother, where our most treasured dyadic relationship is violently taken from us?"
10978,where,romain gary himself told us about a trip he took to sweden with his mother during which they happened to pass a park where the king was playing tennis.
10979,question,"many years ago my mother asked me if i knew why it was a great deal more important to be happy than to be rich, famous, and beautiful: because, as schopenhauer informs us, if we are telling a friend about a very rich, famous, and attractive person, the first question we have to answer is: “but is he or she happy?” however, if we tell the tale of a happy person we are never asked if they are rich, famous, or attractive."
10980,freedom,"today i would only insert freedom instead of happiness, à la simone de beauvoir."
10981,where,are we not all continuously caught in the porcupines’ struggle to reach the optimal distance where one can find the most heat yet be poked by the other to the least possible extent?
10982,repression,"shows that almost every intimate emotional relation between two people which lasts for some time—marriage, friendship, the relations between parents and children—contains a sediment of feelings of aversion and hostility, which only escapes perception as a result of repression."
10983,freedom,"on the contrary, the self never stops recreating the mother through the very freedom it gained from being separated from her."
10984,taken,"this feeling of being worn out has accompanied me since the first day of my return to tehran; it is as though here i am trapped in a never-ending cycle of feelings; it is as though my wonderful, well-established, deeply needed defenses have been suddenly taken away from me."
10985,punitive,"in tehran i cannot escape the existence of old and struggling relatives, but most of all my homeland has reawakened my severe and punitive superego, in the form of condemning me not only to do what i do not want to do, but to enjoy doing it."
10986,guilt,"in my motherland, the moment i decide to do as i please, i am left with nothing but guilt."
10987,where,"in my homeland i have to tolerate the anxieties of the “return of the repressed,” or, as seneca puts it succinctly: one never comes back home with the same moral character one went out with; something or other becomes unsettled where one had achieved internal peace; some one or other of the things one had put to flight reappears on the scene."
10988,imprisoned,he was able to love a girl who was lower than himself; he was able not to be imprisoned by the long list of qualities a girl must have to be worthy of his love.
10989,case,"no wonder she is  upon arriving in tehran  105  always so preoccupied with saying interesting things and being extraordinary; no wonder i have chosen a lexis of ordinary, extraordinary, greatness, banality, and so on to describe the case of my ideal patient."
10990,case,"in my opinion, the process by which an analyst chooses to write about a patient always entails an enactment of the unconscious dynamics of both analytic subjects; the case of ms. n and me is no exception."
10991,case,it could be said that this extraordinary case adheres to the most ordinary of psychoanalytic rules.
10992,question,a good question would have been who the man in bed with me was.
10993,where,"this is how it goes:  upon arriving in tehran  109  “hi, my name is gohar.” “that is an interesting name; where do you come from?” “i am from persia.” (persia always sounds more exotic than iran; it usually triggers the fantasy of faraway lands immediately.)"
10994,where,"the conversation is all about what your name is not; whom you miss; where you did not come from; what you left behind; where your parents were not; when you will leave, and so on: utterly in absence and thus at an inevitable distance; a wonderful lack of intimacy."
10995,where,"home to a land where we were untouchable, where our exoticism provided a shield against all the anxiety and anguish that comes hand in hand with your closeness to your olive tree."
10996,where,"day after day i have felt that i am where i am supposed to be; and what else matters?” hearing my kind supervisor’s voice brought me confusion, pain, and jealousy, but also hope."
10997,where,"some days i work at a clinic where i am exposed to the various kinds of people of my motherland: people from the villages and the city, rich people and people from very low socioeconomic backgrounds, the old and the very young, men and women who i never had a clue about before."
10998,law,"i could not tell you before, but a few nights earlier i had another dream that i was having sex with both my sister and my sister-in-law at the same time.” f, a young girl who moved to tehran from isfahan to study journalism just a few years back, comes to see me."
10999,where,"even if she does not feel like it, she feels obligated to let me go where i have already gone."
11000,building,"being an architect, i have to be on building sites, and i keep fainting in front of all my male workers."
11001,building,"the other day, if one of them had not been strong and observant enough to catch me right away, i would have fallen from a seven-story building and died."
11002,state,"she has lost all her hair, and her eyebrows, yet one can still observe the remains of a striking woman, who even in her current dire state has a certain attractiveness about her."
11003,term,"i heard freud used such a term, and i have been on a sexual mission ever since i can remember."
11004,state,"and he also gives me a lot of cash on a continuing basis.” these episodes are followed  a few years after returning to tehran  125  not only with monetary gain but with guilt, shame, and severe anxiety for k. k shows up to her morning session on the day after such nights in a very devastated state of being, reporting: “i feel like such a whore."
11005,where,i guess it is like the kiarostami movie where the whore tells the woman who is married to a rich guy that the only difference between them is that she is a wholesaler.
11006,state,"if she is not in a continuous state of doing, she feels dead."
11007,death,"as she says one day: “i would much rather be manic than depressed, depression is accompanied by death and darkness; mania is how i choose to live my life."
11008,where,"contemporary psychoanalysis seems to be full of questions such as “where have all the hysterics gone?,” “do we still have neurotic patients on our couches?,” “yesterday’s hysterics are today’s borderlines,” “neurosis: a myth of the past,” and “does anybody talk about sex anymore in psychoanalysis?” observing the psychoanalytic literature, one can only confirm green’s position: that the fashionable “in” themes  a few years after returning to tehran  129  dominating most of the analytic literature in recent years have definitely been narcissistic disorders, borderline disorders, bipolarity, and psychotic states."
11009,question,"my clinical observations—for example, the ones reported here—seem to answer green’s question: i have found sexuality in tehran."
11010,where,"especially considering the traditional iranian cultural base, where sexuality is supposed to be a lot more repressed and taboo than within western cultures."
11011,law,"i had married the man i loved, i could not imagine marrying anyone else, and yet my wedding band, the one i had picked out with the utmost care and attention, the one on which my mother-in-law had had both our names engraved, a wedding band that encapsulated my very personal touch—on my finger it made me feel as if i was  a few years after returning to tehran  131  living somebody else’s life, a life which i was observing from a distance."
11012,taken,never once had i taken it off before.
11013,guilt,"a few years after returning to tehran  133  “is it because the word has now become impregnated with my personal experiences of the last few months, with my mother’s pale, terrified face when my divorce was announced to her, her sense of guilt over what she might have done wrong, what she could have done differently, and the anxiety of an uncertain future for her daughter?"
11014,situation,"suddenly, out of all the memories he shares with my grandfather, perhaps as an attempt to lighten the situation inside his head, he remembers bringing him his favorite kind of brown sugar cubes."
11015,where,“my husband is brought back to the stifling room where one cannot ignore the heaviness and the intensity.
11016,situation,it is as if he just does not have the psychic tools to reverse the situation.
11017,freedom,"and yet, my heart is broken at the prospect of your divorce; it is as if my heart is aching while my mind has become liberated in celebration of your freedom.’ “doctor, the strangest sensations came over me while my father was talking."
11018,state,"was i to spend my many lonely nights contemplating nietzsche, desperate to understand heidegger, and in a state of total vertigo over foucault?"
11019,where,"we did not even have the apartment then, but both of us, in our own ways, started fantasizing about where we would put it, what frame we would buy for it, and who we would like to show it off to."
11020,escaped,"just looking at the picture brings an endless flow of memories with it, which force themselves upon me, coming from nowhere; little details that i thought had escaped me over the years."
11021,where,"“the conservative children of group a had parents who did not talk to them at the kitchen table, where things were not discussed but demanded."
11022,where,group b was also where all sorts of creativity were observed.
11023,freedom,"i always felt like throwing up, felt like shouting ‘things are not black or white, there is always gray, and it is in the gray that we have the best of what our human condition has to offer: like what you and i have been able to produce here!’ i was always constructing and reconstructing my stories, allowing for creativity to surface and enabling freedom, as much as is humanly possible."
11024,where,"after my divorce i came back to the wonderful chaos of group b, where we lead a postmodern life, talk everything out to the point of  a few years after returning to tehran  144  nausea, and yet we do not feel like throwing up."

11032,gate,the gate to the city of shiraz.
11033,toilet,"normally i woke to the sounds of a peddler selling green almonds and fava beans from the sacks hanging on each side of his donkey, the radio screeching the latest news, our only toilet in the hallway flushing, the hustle and bustle of my mother scurrying around to prepare breakfast, to get ready for shabbat, my grandmother asking me to get to the bakery."
11034,where,"breathing them, i wondered where i could take my mind now that their magic had fled through the chimney."
11035,inside,"then, in 1971, as a first-year student, i stepped inside the pahlavi university library and scanned with amazement the large collection of books in translation."
11036,wall,i put my wedding picture in it and hung it on our bedroom wall.
11037,wall,"i leaned against the wall by the closet, my hair still wild from storybook dreams against a soft pillow, my panties wet, my thighs sticky."
11038,wall,she looked at my left shoulder or maybe the wall.
11039,hole,she wrapped her skirt tightly around herself and squatted by the hole in the ground that was our toilet.
11040,sink,"she didn’t use the sink or the wash tub or else they would be contaminated with her gha’edeh, her monthly “mandate.” she wrapped the clean tamei clothes in newspapers, took them outside, and hung them on shrubs in the backyard."
11041,toilet,"when she came back, i helped her wash her hands again over the toilet before she dared to wash them once more in the sink."
11042,where,there was a taboo space around our mother where no one dared to intrude.
11043,where,"she ate from plates that had to be washed separately and stored in a hidden space, where no one could touch them by mistake."
11044,toilet,go rest.” now someone had to bend over the toilet pouring water over my hands to wash my soiled underwear.
11045,sink,"the pots clanked, the water gurgled down the sink, the oil sizzled, the charcoal popped in the mud stove, and sparks flew around a large pot of water."
11046,law,she spurned me as an extension of her dislike for her sister-in-law.
11047,where,"“rouhi, you didn’t show your child where the tamei dishes are!” i had failed my first lesson in womanhood."
11048,inside,"after the initial hurt, i was content, determined to be different, to look inside myself rather than to their world for answers."
11049,sink,i would wash my underwear in the bathroom sink with good soap and sleep on my own mattress.
11050,law,"therefore, when my father and his brother-in-law, masood, knocked at their door thirteen years later to ask for rouhi’s hand in marriage, she was legally of marriageable age."
11051,law,"if my mother didn’t have her deceased sister’s birth certificate, i am sure my maternal grandmother would have found a way to circumvent the law."
11052,law,most officials helped families get around the law that forbade child-marriages.
11053,where,i didn’t want to see beyond the doors where a young man lay with a child-woman for the first time.
11054,law,"maman approached her mother-in-law with the news, her head bowed low in embarrassment."

11263,servitude,"instead, i found it ironic that my father, who struggled and sacrificed so much to get us out of the ghetto, was obviously missing the security of its tall walls and insulated community, where all faces were familiar, where he didn’t have to keep on a mask of politeness, humility, and even servitude at all times to present the neighbors with the opposite of what he thought they expected of a jew."

11303,taken,her sister and niece should have taken their complaints to the school and the teacher.
11304,sentence,"as for reading of the koran, i soon realized that the very first section of each sura was the easiest to read, so i managed to raise my hand quickly and ask with enthusiasm to be the first to read the sentence that starts all writings in islam: “bismilahe rahmane rahim, in the name of the divine merciful god.” that year, my last year in the elementary school, the pressure built up in the house, where interpersonal relationships were becoming more complicated as our numbers increased."

11399,custody,"he had been taken into custody with his two friends, more for their insolence than for the contraband tapes found in the car."
11400,jail,"and yet it is true that people who brave censorship, jail and torture to gain access to books or music or movies or works of art tend to hold the whole enterprise in an entirely different light."
11401,question,"they don’t care about books and such things.” every once in a while, after a talk, during a book signing or over coffee with an old friend, this point will come up, usually as a question: “don’t you think that literature and books were so important in iran because there was so much repression there?"
11402,state,"many have seldom left their hometown or state, but does this mean that they do not dream, that they have no fears, that they don’t feel pain and anguish and yearn for a life of meaning?"
11403,power,stories are not mere flights of fantasy or instruments of political power and control.
11404,taken,"but perhaps there is another, more personal reason for my disagreement with ramin: i cannot imagine myself feeling at home in a place that is indifferent to what has become my true home, a land with no borders and few restrictions, which i have taken to calling “the  republic of imagination.” i think of it as nabokov’s “somehow, somewhere” or alice’s backyard, a world that runs parallel to the real one, whose occupants need no passport or documentation."
11405,where,"), where they lived, their daily routine, their school."
11406,exercise,"near the end of each session, my tutor would close our exercise book and make her way to the kitchen, from which she would emerge with a glass of cherry sherbet and a worn copy of the wonderful wizard of oz."
11407,inside,"what would happen to her when a cyclone lifted her up with her house, with toto trapped inside, and landed them in a magical place called oz?"
11408,where,"had i been able to formulate my first impressions of the united states, i might have said that there was a place in america called kansas, where people could find a magic land at the heart of a cyclone."
11409,justice,"kansas and omaha were soon followed by a river called mississippi and many more cities, rivers, forests, lakes and people—the orderly suburban households of nancy drew, the frontier towns of little house on the prairie and stormy plantations of gone with the wind, the kentucky farm of uncle tom’s cabin and the dusty, sultry southern streets of to kill a mockingbird, where justice was as embattled a notion as it would soon be in tehran."
11410,where,"i was not sure what to make of american musicals, where characters suddenly started gyrating in the middle of a meal or while walking down the street, as if overtaken by a mischievous genie, bursting into song only to calm down the next minute and resume eating or talking or kissing."
11411,where,"it is not just bookstores and libraries that are disappearing but museums, theaters, performing arts centers, art and music schools—all those places where i felt at home have joined the list of endangered species."
11412,transferred,"in a sign of the times, the bloomberg news website recently transferred its book coverage to the luxury section, alongside yachts, sports clubs and wine, as if to signal that books are an idle indulgence of the super-rich."
11413,state,"at some point this state of affairs became an obsession with me, and i began to think that there must be some connection between the demise of the idealistic or moral aspects of the american dream and its material side."
11414,state,"i started collecting newspaper accounts and statistics on the state of the humanities, alongside articles on education, health care, social mobility and all the other component parts of the material aspect of the american dream."
11415,state,"i began reading blogs on education and books about the internet or the state of the economy, surprising my friends with references to joseph stiglitz and jaron lanier."
11416,sentences,"words that i had never paid attention to now made frequent appearances in my notes, alongside phrases like “income inequality” and “upward mobility.” after the fashion of my student days, i pasted a few sentences on a piece of paper and wrote underneath, in red ink, “the american dream?” later, i added: “the way we view fiction is a reflection of how we define ourselves as a nation."
11417,state,"works of the imagination are canaries in the coal mine, the measure by which we can evaluate the health of the rest of society.”  and yet i was not unaware that the current state of affairs was partly due to the fact that many of our dreams had been fulfilled."
11418,freedom,"••• for ramin, “freedom” and “individual rights” were not mere words."
11419,criminal,"he had experienced their deprivation in concrete terms and had been forced to read books, listen to music, dance and hold hands with his girlfriend in secret, like a criminal, and like a criminal he had been punished—over here we can safely say tortured—when his transgression was discovered."
11420,freedom,"for him, as for millions of others who have lost a country and a life coming to this land in search of the fugitive freedom they were denied back home, imagination and ideas are not accessories; they are essential to the preservation of identity, to what makes us human beings with a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
11421,taken,"and so while all of these future or would-be citizens will celebrate the generosity of america, its gift of choice and freedom, they are often more anxious than those born here about the potential of squandering what is now so frequently taken for granted."
11422,state,"in countries such as iran, imagination is threatened by a regime that desires total control over the lives of its citizens, for whom resistance against the state is not just a political act but an existential one."
11423,where,"but what of democracies, where that naked tyranny does not exist?"
11424,torture,"in a totalitarian country, brutality and repression are present in their most blatant forms: torture, arbitrary laws, executions."
11425,state,"ironically, within such societies, the value of imagination, its threat to the existence of the state as well as its importance to the lives of citizens, is quite obvious— which is one reason why people in repressive societies tend to take great risks to read banned books, watch banned films and listen to banned music."
11426,state,"it is a basic need, a way to reclaim an identity confiscated by the state."
11427,power,"regardless of their ideological inclinations, autocracies like those wreaking havoc in iran, china, zimbabwe, saudi arabia and north korea are afraid, and justifiably so, of the aftermath of literacy—namely, knowledge, the bite of the forbidden fruit, with its promise of a different kind of power and freedom."
11428,murder,that is why the taliban destroys schools and wishes to murder young teenage girls like malala who are brave enough to publicly articulate their passionate desire for education and freedom.
11429,state,"in a democracy, the arts tend not to threaten the state or to exert such a sense of urgency."
11430,state,"you can be seduced into a paralysis of consciousness, a state of intellectual indolence."
11431,state,"“the real danger for a writer is not so much the possibility (and often the certainty) of persecution on the part of the state, as it is the possibility of finding oneself mesmerized by the state’s features, which, whether monstrous or undergoing changes for the better, are always temporary.” again, brodsky!"
11432,state,"every  state, including a totalitarian one, has its lures and seductions."
11433,power,"fiction is an antidote, a reminder of the power of individual choice."
11434,state,"every novel has at its core a choice by at least one of its protagonists, reminding the reader that she can choose to be her own person, to go against what her parents or society or the state tell her to do and follow the faint but essential beat of her own heart."
11435,death,"what made brodsky, nabokov, czeslaw milosz and hannah arendt—all of whom took refuge in america (einstein too, for that matter)—resist the totalitarian states of their home countries and reject the empty temptations of western democracies was essentially one and the same thing: they knew that to negate and betray that inner self was not just a surrender to the tyrant’s will but a sort of self-inflicted death."
11436,question,"for this they need to know, to pause, to think, to question."
11437,where,"how can we protect ourselves from a culture of manipulation, where tastes and flavors are re-created chemically in laboratories and given to us as natural food, where religion is packaged, televised and tweeted and commercials influence us to such an extent that they dictate not only what we eat, wear, read and want but what and how we dream."
11438,imprisoned,"i am reminded of nabokov’s statement that “readers are born free and ought to remain free.” we have learned to protest when writers are imprisoned, or when their books are censored and banned."
11439,where,"••• as a child, i was too mesmerized by the land of oz to pay much attention to that other place where dorothy lived, her home in kansas."
11440,where,"it is described in some detail: the house is really one large room where dorothy, aunt em, uncle henry and dorothy’s dog, toto, all live."
11441,taken,"they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also.” she never smiles."
11442,case,"the famous metro-goldwyn-mayer technicolor talkie, made in the thirties, has likewise been interpreted in light of its times (in this case the great depression)."
11443,where,"somehow the stories, the travels to oz and to wonderland, with pinocchio into the stomach of the whale, and later to that remote planet where the little prince watered that one flower—his self-centered rose—made me more willing to go through the routines of life."
11444,where,"you have to ask yourself, where should i start to pick up the pieces?"
11445,inside,"until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” difference is always celebrated in literature, but the cult of difference can become dangerous when it is not accompanied by that shock of recognition and the realization of how alike we are—that, despite our differences, our hearts beat to the same rhythms and we are all capable of the best and the worst."
11446,freedom,"at first i reveled in my newfound freedom: at last, i could craft my own curriculum without having to worry that the dean would call me in if my hair slipped out from underneath my headscarf, or for my unorthodox and casual behavior toward my students, or the unsavory books i taught."
11447,authority,"what had started as a serious theoretical questioning of authority had by now become an easy formula, applied to both literature and reality."
11448,suspect,"classic texts were now suspect, symbols of scorned elitist orthodoxy."
11449,power,"students who disagreed with my political views—and who, being in a place of power, could have denounced me because of my unruly habit of voicing those views— would come to my office to talk about bellow or nabokov, ibsen or austen."
11450,power,"tell it to my fellow iranians, whose supreme leader was so afraid of the power of literature that he condemned a writer to death, a writer whose only weapons were words!” true equality is not an invitation simply to talk about ourselves, to boast about ourselves or present ourselves always as victims."
11451,question,"at first the invitations were mostly from colleges, and then book festivals, museums and civic associations, and a wide variety of different high schools like city honors school in buffalo, thomas jefferson high school in virginia, spence and choate and the bronx academy, where through the enthusiastic efforts of one teacher, amy matthusen, each year for the past three years i have held a question-andanswer session with her class."
11452,war,"and as i talked to people old and young, to doctors and soldiers, librarians and teachers, and began to confide my secret desire to connect readers all over the world and engage them in a meaningful dialogue—when i told them about my dream of creating a republic of imagination and invited them to join me in a march on washington so that we would fill the space between the jefferson memorial and the lincoln memorial, going past all of the war monuments and the jewel in america’s crown, the smithsonian, and spreading all the way out toward the library of congress and the white house, ending in front of congress, where we would ask, “who is going to bail out imagination”—many came up to me afterward and said, “how can i help?” “what can i do?” i found a nation of readers, large and small, old and young, rich and poor, of all colors and backgrounds, united by the shared sense that books matter, that they open up a window into a more meaningful life, that they enable us to tolerate complexity and nuance and to empathize with people whose lives and conditions are utterly different from our own."
11453,power,"••• when dorothy and her friends finally find the great wizard, in response to oz’s declaration “i am oz, the great and terrible,” dorothy simply responds, “i am dorothy, the small and meek.” dorothy and her companions discover in the end that the myth of oz’s power is as much of a sham as their belief in their own weakness, and that they, led by dorothy, can do what oz was powerless to achieve: destroy the wicked witch and liberate the frightened citizens—a myth worthy of a people who had defeated a mighty empire in search of their own independence."
11454,power,"these homeless protagonists of american fiction become the true guardians of what is best in american individualism, never identifying happiness with wealth or power."
11455,power,"perhaps in no other fiction, in fact, is materialism so frowned upon, or defined as the root of so many evils—an ironic but salutary reminder for a country so blatantly devoted to the pursuit of wealth and power."
11456,power,"there is some truth in that, but it has been a long time since america moved from the margins to the center of power, with the privileges of wealth replacing those of birth—a long time since george washington and benjamin franklin refused wages because they felt they were public servants and should be immune from the temptations and corruption of money."
11457,freedom,"i wanted them to know how vital they were in america, too, as the freedom that so many fictional characters lay claim to is not political but moral, a freedom to turn their back on society and what is expected of them and  to forge their own lonely path."
11458,civil rights,"i felt that james baldwin, as a writer and civil rights activist, was most suited to mark the termination of what i think of as the classical period of american fiction and the beginning of a new epoch."
11459,authority,"from the moment plato’s philosopher king threw the poet out of his republic, we knew that imagination was dangerous to authority and that the alternative eye of the poet would always be deviant and unpredictable, always subverting authority and captivating souls."
11460,state,"what i have in mind is most closely captured by václav havel, who said, “hope is a state of mind, not of the world."
11461,justice,"the central theme of the play antigone, written in 441 b.c., about a young woman’s dilemma as she finds herself caught between the pressures of obeying the dictates of personal honor and burying her brother, who rebelled against the kingdom, or of heeding a more public notion of justice and obeying the law of the king, her uncle, by letting his corpse rot unburied, resurfaces in various guises today even in our most popular story forms, in episodes of boston legal and white collar."
11462,building,"if we need fiction today, it is not because we need to escape from reality; it is because we need to return to it with eyes that are refreshed, or, as tolstoy would have it, “clean-washed.” six years ago, i swore a public oath in a bland government office building, but i became an american citizen long before that, when i first began to trace my imaginary map of america, beginning with dorothy’s kansas and the desiccated farmland of the ingalls sisters."
11463,case,"that america is a country of immigrants is a truism, and even now it remains the case—it is populated by people from many parts of the globe who have brought with them the restless ghosts of their original homelands, making homelessness an integral part of american identity."
11464,question,"there was something in that dream, in the imagination of america’s founders and the humanistic spirit they embodied, that made it possible for later generations to question and subvert the conditions under which they wrote their founding documents, the constitution and the declaration of independence, so that later men and women like frederick douglass, abraham lincoln, elizabeth cady stanton, susan b. anthony, martin luther king jr. and others would make those words their own, insisting on new freedoms and reminding us, as the historian gordon wood so eloquently put it, that “it is not suffrage that  gives life to democracy, it is our democratic society that gives life to suffrage.” this, for me, is the intersection where the real america meets the imaginary one."
11465,question,"if you believe your country was founded on the actualization of a dream, then an obvious and essential question arises: how can you dream without imagination?"
11466,death,"for homelessness and despair, for the injustices and suffering imposed on us by the fickleness of life and the absoluteness of death, imagination has no cure."
11467,injustice,"but it finds a voice that both registers and resists such injustice, evidenced by the fact that we do not accept things as they are."
11468,where,"so much of who we are, no matter where we live, depends on how we imagine ourselves to be."
11469,freedom,"for every writer deprived of the freedom of speech, millions of readers are also deprived of the freedom to read what they might have told us."
11470,crime,"that is why the voice of a poet who endured and resisted tyranny should be the voice of conscience, reminding us of what is essential: “since there are no laws that can protect us from ourselves, no criminal code is capable of preventing a true crime against literature,” joseph brodsky said in his nobel prize acceptance speech."
11471,suppression,"“though we can condemn the material suppression of literature—the persecution of writers, acts of censorship, the burning of books—we are powerless when it comes to its worst violation: that of not reading the books."
11472,crime,"for that crime, a person pays with his whole life; if the offender is a nation, it pays with its history.” my conversation with ramin and subsequent conversations over the years with those who have felt homeless in their own home—those who have carried their ghosts with them while in some way believing in and relying upon that other home, the portable one—inspired the writing of this book."
11473,crime,"—oscar wilde, the picture of dorian gray  i muse upon my country’s ills— the tempest bursting from the waste of time on the world’s fairest hope linked with man’s foulest crime."
11474,where,"she kept smiling, with no trace of self-pity or pain, just pure mischief—she had me where she wanted me."
11475,jail,"she had survived a revolution and a war, had been smuggled across the border from iran into turkey, seven months’ pregnant, her two-and-half-year-old daughter in tow while her husband was being tortured in a tehran jail—to name just one example among many."
11476,where,"we were driving back to georgetown from chevy chase, where we had spent over two hours at a borders bookstore that no longer exists with farah’s older sister, mahnaz, jumping from heated discussions of the presidential race in america (this was 2008, and despite obama’s victory in the primaries, we were still debating the comparative merits of obama and clinton) to gossip, shopping, the iranian government’s machinations and my upcoming interview for u.s. citizenship."
11477,sentences,"we would be giddy with excitement, too impatient to let one another finish our sentences, childishly interrupting with a chaos of allusions and shortcuts understandable only to ourselves."
11478,serving,"even at the hairdresser (because we three would meet there, too, when one of us needed a haircut or a blow-dry), we would be so raucous that soon the polite and considerate owner relegated us to a back room, serving us cappuccinos while we tried in vain to keep our voices down."
11479,term,"more than anything else, it was that ready access to two languages, to their poetry and fiction, to their cultures, vague as that term might seem, that provided us with a temporary feeling of stability."
11480,democracy in america,"“at a school for international studies, for heaven’s sake!” i would soon discover that most of the class did not know about the frenchman who had written democracy in america."
11481,wall,"“i bet quite a few of my students in iran would at least have heard of him.” “all the more reason,” farah said, seemingly unperturbed, “why you should read joseph j. ellis’s founding brothers.” two years later, i would accompany mahnaz to farah’s bedroom to choose a keepsake from a pile of books randomly stacked against the wall, like a group of orphaned children waiting for a new parent."
11482,thief,"yes, i am effectively a thief.” huck came to mean more to farah as she sorted through her memories and sought to tell herself and her daughter the story of her own journey—her “adventure,” if that is the right word for all manner of bad luck."
11483,question,"farah, mahnaz and i would periodically return to this question, without ever agreeing on a satisfactory answer."
11484,taken,"she had taken the kind of step my mother would have liked to and never had, leaving behind security, comfort, beloved friends."
11485,executed,"the grandmother chose to become a baha’i, a banned sect, inviting all manner of persecution, and later mahnaz became a women’s rights activist and the first minister for women’s affairs in the shah’s government, and had the honor of being on the islamic republic’s blacklist of people who were to be executed for “warring with god” and “spreading prostitution.” (later, in exile, when the rulers of the islamic republic tried to silence her, mahnaz continued in the same vein, as an innovative and dedicated champion of women’s rights.)"
11486,civil rights,"like many of my age, i participated in various political groups in a decade that saw the blossoming of the civil rights and women’s movements and that ended abruptly for me in 1979 with the islamic revolution in iran."
11487,war,"in those days, i felt i was living in two different americas: the america of the vietnam war and the civil rights and women’s rights movements, of nixon and watergate, and the neighboring country i had discovered through its fiction, poetry, film, art and music: john coltrane, miles davis, janis joplin, judy collins, edward hopper, the harlem renaissance, the marx brothers, howard hawks, woody allen, herman melville, flannery o’connor, william faulkner, ralph ellison, edith wharton, f. scott fitzgerald, nathanael west, raymond chandler, emily dickinson, elizabeth bishop, william carlos williams, sylvia plath, e. e. cummings."
11488,civil rights,"we were too young to have participated in the civil rights movement that had defined the sixties, that of martin luther king jr. and james baldwin."
11489,liberty,she even tied herself up to the statue of liberty once with a group of friends to protest the shah.
11490,state,"those were the days when men tried to seduce you, if not with grass and mescaline, then through a discussion of engels’s the origin of the family, private property, and the state."
11491,justice,"farah and i both joined the student movement not just out of a sense of justice, but because we found in it a connection to our old home."
11492,civil rights,"that was a decade when all sorts of “vice” and all forms of rebellion flourished simultaneously side by side, the maoists and marxist–leninists, the trotskyites, the hippies, the feminists, the civil rights activists, the vietnam veterans, even the hare krishna."
11493,war,"we would sing songs about joe hill and chant neil young’s “don’t let it bring you down,” occupying administration buildings alongside the “flower children” as well as members of the black panthers or the revolutionary communist party—one movement for peace and one for war."
11494,where,"while some protested and marched militantly, others would streak across the lawns and occupy movie houses in small towns like norman, oklahoma, where i happened to be studying huckleberry finn."
11495,poverty,"it was and perhaps still is seductive to follow the misadventures of a lonely and poverty-stricken orphan in a cruel and ungenerous world, only to be rewarded in the end, alongside our protagonist, with a wealthy relative and a warm home."
11496,punishment,yet i never quite forgot the orphan huck and the knowledge that both the reward and the punishment for his straying from the fold was a permanent state of homelessness.
11497,question,"even when the time came to question and doubt and finally to distance herself from the movement, she was one of those rare individuals who broke her ideological ties and remained personally loyal, refusing to betray those who had first given her a sense of belonging."
11498,liberty,"“i kept telling her, when we were working on her cv,” mahnaz told me much later, “that tying yourself to the statue of liberty is not the best recommendation for a job.” two decades later, all three of us were refugees in washington, d.c., laughing at our own  follies."
11499,freedom,"“i want to read you a line from george washington’s final speech as commander in chief—i found it in your book by joseph ellis.” she mumbled a bit about needing to sleep, but then she said, “okay, fine, what is it?” i cleared my throat and did my best george washington impersonation: “‘at this auspicious period, the united states came into existence as a nation, and if their citizens should not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.’” washington believed it was essential that america, having won her freedom, should not squander it on petty squabbles."
11500,state,he wrote his open letter to the governors of the newly independent states in large measure to warn them to resist factional disputes that might pit one state against another.
11501,question,"the question that seemed to animate him was how to articulate the new reality back home, the distinct new american identity—how to give america its own voice."
11502,cell,"this was the main thrust of the lecture i was preparing on that gray, gloomy day, when, sitting on the couch with my notes on my knees, a cigar that i never smoked dangling from my lips to assuage a nervous tension i had whenever i wrote, pen in one hand and phone in the other, farah called me on her cell."
11503,state,"speaking to descendants of the mayflower, he begins by asking his audience why they would wish to celebrate “those ancestors of yours of 1620—the mayflower tribe,” whom he describes as a “hard lot” who “took good care of themselves, but they abolished everybody else’s ancestors.” twain differentiates himself from his hosts, telling them, “i am a border ruffian from the state of missouri."
11504,where,"i have the morals of missouri and the culture of connecticut, and that’s the combination that makes the perfect man.” then he goes on to say, “but where are my ancestors?"
11505,where,where shall i celebrate?
11506,where,"where shall i find the raw material?” identifying with those “abolished” ancestors, he assumes the identity of america’s persecuted underdogs and says his first american ancestor was “an early indian.” “your ancestors skinned him alive, and i am an orphan."
11507,slavery,"[they] broke forever the chains of political slavery, and gave the vote to every man in this wide land, excluding none!—none except those who did not belong to the orthodox church.” then he invokes the salem witches and, finally, the most persecuted and marginalized of all, the black slave: “the first slave brought into new england out of africa by your progenitors was an ancestor of mine—for i am of a mixed breed, an infinitely shaded and exquisite mongrel."
11508,where,"7 i was impatiently waiting for farah at the coffee shop of the phillips collection, one of my hidden lairs, where i worked and rewarded myself by wandering around the museum at intervals and gazing at my favorite paintings."
11509,term,"i had already started thinking and talking about the main themes for my new book, as well as planning the course for next term, which was to start with huck finn."
11510,where,"(3) the whole story is shaped around one central theme, best articulated by mark twain in a notebook entry of 1895, in which he describes huck finn as ‘a book of mine where a sound heart & a deformed conscience come into collision & conscience suffers defeat.’” i was excited like a child and almost felt like saying, “how cool is that?"
11511,where,"afterwards, i took farah to a room where mainly the pictures by african american painters were housed."
11512,power,but out of the struggle came a kind of power and even beauty.”  8 huckleberry finn was the first book i taught when i went back to iran in 1979 and accepted a position in the department of english language and literature at the university of tehran.
11513,crime,"i thought it would be more exciting, and perhaps more fruitful, to treat literary research the way one would a treasure hunt, following a web of clues until one could piece together the genesis of the story, or the motive, or the crime."
11514,charge,"in 1957 the naacp called huck finn racially offensive, and since 1976 the charge has resurfaced in one form or another every decade or so."
11515,term,"toni morrison beautifully weighed in on the subject, arguing that “the narrow notion of how to handle the offense mark twain’s use of the term ‘nigger’ would occasion for black students and the corrosive effect it would have on white ones” was “a purist yet elementary kind of censorship designed to appease adults rather than educate children."
11516,serving,"i was reminded of how professors and publishers in iran, like the walrus and the carpenter tearfully eating the oysters in through the looking-glass, would provide elaborate and self-serving justifications for their decision to delete words like “wine” and “lovemaking” from works of fiction."
11517,civil rights,"in this instance, censorship was rooted in a sense of righteous indignation, as the publisher explained how he, a native of alabama, had witnessed dr. king’s and other civil rights leaders’ struggles and been transformed by them, and how in altering the book now, he only wanted to do the right thing."
11518,slavery,twain’s use of the word “nigger” demonstrates more than anything else how deeply and perniciously justifications for slavery were ingrained in the minds of americans.
11519,abuse,"i confess, the tame blueberry is my own contribution; now that i had been transformed from student to teacher, i could afford to abuse literary theory’s potentials for endless cat-and-mouse games with the text."
11520,sentence,"her paper included few, if any, references or footnotes, and its language, following the curves and contours of her feelings, was for the most part barren and formal, but every few lines it veered into a poetic sentence or two."
11521,fugitive,her central point was more of a complaint than an argument: why should students be made to read about this homeless and “unhappy” little boy and the fugitive slave who accompanied him at a time when they themselves felt so insecure?
11522,jailed,"within the next few years, many among them were jailed or executed or fled the country."
11523,freedom,"9 until i started teaching the adventures of huckleberry finn, i thought that huck and jim’s main obstacles to freedom were members of “respectable” society, like miss watson, but the more i delved into the book, the more i realized that it was far more subtle than that."
11524,power,"tom is just a kid—he doesn’t have miss watson’s power.” “exactly because he is a kid,” i said, “he is even more dangerous."
11525,where,"when, at the end of their adventures, the two friends find gold and return home as heroes, tom goes back to the fold, where judge thatcher has grand plans for his future, but huck disappears, escaping the pious widow douglas, who wants to adopt and educate him."
11526,possession,"huck asks his friend to take possession of his share of gold, and every once in a while to give him a few cents."
11527,gang,"it’s just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead all the time.” he has no desire to be rich and live in those “smothery houses.” huck is softened only when tom slyly tells him that he can’t be a part of his gang of robbers if he refuses to become a respectable member of the community."
11528,freedom,"for him, life in his native town leads to “a-wishing you was dead all the time.” rejecting the kind of respectability that inevitably accompanies stability and security, huck sets out on his own in pursuit of another american dream: freedom."
11529,authority,"twain will make it his own, subverting not just the respectable view of the world, but his readers’ expectations, following john locke’s maxim that all authority is error."
11530,where,"when miss watson preaches about the rewards of going to heaven (where she is headed) and the punishments of hell (tom sawyer’s future abode), huck informs her that he wouldn’t want to go to heaven without tom sawyer."
11531,where,"i got so down-hearted and scared i did wish i had some company.” all of this happens in the second page of the first chapter, where the words “dead” and “die” occur three times in one paragraph that also mentions a ghost feeling restless in its grave."
11532,where,"while preparing for my class, i got into the habit of reading the relevant passages aloud, almost acting them out, an exercise that i carried over to the class itself, where, during our discussions, i would ask my students to volunteer reading certain passages from the book."
11533,where,"in that opening scene, nature, the leaves, the stars, the whip-poor-will, the dog and the wind all are mournful and fearsome, unlike the wilderness huck will later take refuge in, where even danger is a “healthy” part of life."
11534,death,"whereas for huck to be “regular,” to submit to someone else’s rules, was literally akin to death."
11535,murder,"tom and huck meet up with other boys, members of tom’s band of robbers, and pretend to loot and murder people, committing all these acts in “style,” like highwaymen, and as it’s done “in the books.” their victims must be killed because, as tom explains, “some authorities think different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them.” from the start, the reader can see that tom is huck’s best friend only superficially."
11536,gang,"all the words that frighten huck and drive him away from the widow’s smothery home are used by tom: “regular,” “it’s considered best,” “the correct thing to do.” tom’s language is what huck instinctively finds wrong with him when, after a month, he resigns from the gang of robbers."
11537,death,"greedy for the gold huck found, he steals his own son, beats him to the point of death and locks him in a shed."
11538,where,"“there warn’t no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white ."
11539,state,"a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white.” pap’s physical repulsiveness matches his character, reflected in his rant against the government for doing nothing to rein in the free black man from ohio he sees in town, who has the “whitest shirt,” the “shiniest hat,” a “gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane” and is also a “p’fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything”—and, worst of all, he could vote in his own state."
11540,situation,"as with the widow douglas, huck tries to adjust to his situation with pap."
11541,authority,"but there is something restless in him, an urge to question authority."
11542,where,"huck begins to get used to his routine with his pap, until something jolts him and makes him run: his pap tells him that the judge is trying to get him back to the widow douglas’s, where huck envisions himself again becoming “so cramped up and sivilized.” pap tells him that if the judge decides in her favor, he will hide huck somewhere no one can find him, leading to huck’s decision to go so far away that neither “the old man nor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more.” “the secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow,” twain wrote in his journal."
11543,slavery,"the more i read about twain’s life, the more amazed i was by his almost instinctive hatred of slavery."
11544,slavery,"“in my schoolboy days i had no aversion to slavery,” twain reminisced late in life."
11545,slavery,"no one arraigned it in my hearing; the local papers said nothing against it; the local pulpit taught us that god approved it, that it was a holy thing, and that the doubter need only look in the bible if he wished to settle his mind— and then the texts were read aloud to us to make the matter sure; if the slaves themselves had an aversion to slavery they were wise and said nothing.” his childhood memories left such a mark on him that slavery became to his mind a universal symbol of man’s cruelty, stupidity and depravity."
11546,punishment,"in 1904, years after the publication of huck finn, he wrote in his notebook, “the skin of every human being contains a slave.” the impact of his childhood experiences grew as he himself grew older and took up other causes: defending the jews, women, the people of the congo, workers and all of the oppressed; claiming to be a revolutionary; already predicting the ideological wars to come when he declared not “my country right or wrong” but “my country—when it is right.” witnessing the mistreatment by a german hotel manager of an indian servant who accepted his punishment without protest, twain writes that the incident “carried me instantly back to my boyhood and flashed upon me the forgotten fact that this was the usual way of explaining one’s desire to a slave.” he remembered his own father’s regular cuffing of their slave boy and the accidental murder of a slave by his master, confessing that as a child he had accepted such treatment as natural, although he also felt “sorry for the victim and ashamed for the punisher.” twain felt it was not enough to condemn slavery; he felt he had to investigate as a writer its effects on the lives of individuals."
11547,crime,"to help steal a horse or a cow was a low crime, but to help a hunted slave, or feed him or shelter him, or hide him, or comfort him, in his troubles, his terrors, his despair, or hesitate to promptly betray him to the slave-catcher when opportunity offered was a much baser crime, & carried with it a stain, a moral smirch which nothing could wipe away."
11548,slavery,"could such horrors as slavery or the holocaust happen without the complicity and voluntary blindness of decent, ordinary people, those who go to church and volunteer for good works and yet can easily turn, as they do in huck finn, into a murderous mob?"
11549,question,it might have been this question that gave huck such a dramatic sense of urgency when i taught it in those violent revolutionary days in iran.
11550,slavery,"twain remembered his own mother, who, like the widow douglas or aunt sally, was “kind-  hearted and compassionate” but “was not conscious that slavery was a bald, grotesque, and unwarrantable usurpation.” when acting on her instincts, she impulsively took the victim’s side, seemingly unaware of the contradictory nature of her actions and feelings."
11551,power,"we were comrades, and yet not comrades; color and condition interposed a subtle line which both parties were conscious of, and which rendered complete fusion impossible.” from one of the slaves on the farm where he grew up, he learned the language and the mesmerizing power of stories."
11552,law,"it was on the farm that i got my strong liking for his race and my appreciation of certain of its fine qualities.” in real life, samuel clemens befriended frederick douglass and booker t. washington and paid for the tuition of warner mcguinn, who was among the first black students to study law at yale."
11553,slavery,"“the shame is ours, not theirs,” he wrote in his letter to the dean of the yale law school in 1885, “& we should pay for it.”  11 there were many ways of fighting slavery, from attempting to change the laws to preaching to shaming the slave owners to taking up arms."
11554,authority,decades would pass before slave narratives developed the language and the form necessary to escape from the strictures of an authority that not only dominated their reality but also interfered with their imagination.
11555,death,"henry james said it was as if “a fish, a wonderful, leaping fish, had simply flown through the air.” it was so effective in stirring up emotion that more than a century later, in the islamic republic of iran, my daughter, after finishing the book, woke up every morning for a whole week crying for the death of uncle tom and his little friend eva."
11556,authority,"unlike huck finn, which challenges all authority, perhaps especially that of religion, most of the fictional slave narratives were “christian” in tone and message."
11557,slavery,"in one sense, of course, they offered up an alternative view of christianity, challenging slave owners and their preachers to defend and justify slavery."
11558,slavery,"rather than let the characters do the work, harriet beecher stowe intervenes and desperately at times tries to persuade the reader of the heinous nature of slavery."
11559,freedom,"i do not care what it expresses, and i cannot tell, generally, but expression is what i worship, it is what i glory in, with all my impetuous nature.” although from the moment they meet, jim depends on huck for his life and freedom, in more ways than one huck’s own freedom and life depend on jim."
11560,death,"this is not only because jim looks after huck and helps him find food and shelter but also because he is the first person to see huck after his staged death, and so in one sense he resurrects him."
11561,state,"not only set the black slaves free, but set the white man free also.” jim is the most orphaned character in the story, as his whole race has been abducted from its home and subjected to a permanent state of orphanhood—a fact that adds poignancy to his escape in search of the family he has been torn from."
11562,authorities,"he questions the system of beliefs sanctioned by religious and social authorities, and he is the only individual with whom huck has genuine exchanges."
11563,power,"for those of us who have lost our power to perceive the world magically, this might appear to be a negative point, a sign of his inferiority."
11564,authority,"away from the authority of the white masters, away from the house that enslaves jim and oppresses huck, they create a world with their own rules."
11565,killing,"as they navigate, observing the “lonesomeness of the river,” they are constantly threatened by the danger and violence that emanate like poisonous fumes from the land and its “smothery houses”: the feuding between the seemingly civilized and churchgoing grangerfords and shepherdsons, the cold-blooded and open killing of a helpless drunk, seething mob anger, the tarring and feathering of the duke and the dauphin."
11566,state,"when you live in an authoritarian state, to remain alive you have to pass yourself off as someone else."
11567,question,"so they force us to question and reexamine what we would consider to be basic, unchanging moral principles: under what conditions might it be right to lie, to break the law, to cheat, to blaspheme?"
11568,where,"farah was an adjunct, teaching english in the same department where i had a full-time position."
11569,war,"in my memory of those two times i saw her in tehran, we both appeared nonchalant and carefree, but in reality they were dark days, filled with so much anxiety and fear about the war with iraq and the constant violence."
11570,arrested,"it had become customary to hear about relatives, friends and students who had been arrested, tortured and killed."
11571,executed,"a lucky few managed to flee the country, but i had my share of cousins hiding out or killed, friends on the run, students executed."
11572,freedom,"on landing in tehran, the religious students left the plane chanting, “long live the islamic revolution,” while farah and her comrades walked out shouting, “long live freedom and liberty.” the airport was controlled by the revolutionary guards and closed to commercial air traffic."
11573,prisoner,"he was, by farah’s account, not so much a believer as “a prisoner of the mind-set he had helped to create."
11574,disaster,"“at the end of each day, i would breathe easier and say to myself, another day and no disaster."
11575,state,"i cannot imagine how, even then, they could have believed that they would ever garner enough support to destroy the new islamic state."
11576,police,"that morning, nearly a hundred men and women attacked the headquarters of the police and guards in amol."
11577,tortured,there were people being tortured in prison who sooner or later would reveal their names and whereabouts.
11578,disaster,they lived perhaps with more intensity than before but “with no conscious recognition of impending disaster.” they made fun of the mullahs on television.
11579,evin,"farah was lucky to find a temporary shelter at a good friend’s house with a gorgeous garden, close to the dreaded evin prison, where her husband and his comrades were kept."
11580,prisoners,“every morning at dawn i walked to the wall at the bottom of the garden to listen to the chants of the prisoners.
11581,torture,i refused to think of torture.
11582,prisoners,"i refused to think that [he] would probably not be among those prisoners.”  13 during her last years, but especially that final year, a circle formed around farah, consisting of her family and friends."
11583,law,"each one of us was honored with a special role in farah’s life, and everyone was more than his or her assigned role: mahnaz was more than a sister, neda more than a daughter, nema more than a son, hamid more than a brother, jaleh more than a former comrade and best friend, roshanak more than a former sister-in-law, bahram more than an intellectual companion, and within that exclusive list i was left with the role of more than a childhood friend."
11584,question,"this question of america’s founding myths had become a more urgent preoccupation to me, as all around us there seemed to be a contest going on to define who was more or less american."
11585,question,"“patriots” were those who don’t question the government’s new laws, “homeland” something that needed to be defended, and everywhere, even at school, we were being reminded of the need for “security.” “have a safe day.” safe?"
11586,state,"the islamic revolution forever changed the meaning of words like “spirituality,” “religion,” “virtuous,” “decadent,” “alien.” these words became orphans associated with fear, danger, corruption and the state, in the same way that in the soviet union words like “proletariat,” “dictatorship,” “equality,” “freedom” and “revolution” had lost their original meaning."
11587,law,"that was when i dramatically announced to my close circle of friends that once i’d started watching more law & order than news, i knew the time had come to look a little more closely into what was going on."
11588,law,"law & order was a good story, plausible and realistic, while the news appeared more and more like entertainment or fantasy—or horror, depending on your point of view."
11589,taken,"when you trust jon stewart and stephen colbert more than the so-called news offered up by fox or msnbc, when you find them fairer and more balanced, when those interviewed on face the nation and other serious news shows appear more and more like comic parodies, then the time must surely have come, i told farah with a flourish, to defect in favor of a more appealing america, the one whose founding documents were written by poets and novelists, the one i’d taken to calling the republic of imagination."
11590,where,"remember that episode of the simpsons where homer is worried because mr. burns has threatened him, saying he will destroy his every single dream, and marge tells him not to worry so much, that when a man’s greatest dreams are seconds on dessert, the occasional snuggle and sleeping in on weekends, no one can destroy your dreams?"
11591,evin,14 farah stayed in the house with the large garden at the foot of evin prison for about a month.
11592,law,"remaining in tehran was becoming too dangerous for her and for faramarz’s family, as well as for the friends who were giving her asylum, so she decided to leave iran, along with faramarz’s sister and her six-month-old baby, his brother and sister-in-law, and her own twoand-a-half-year-old daughter, neda."
11593,stretch,"“i was forced to stretch my legs across the top of the gunny sacks, which left my belly touching the rump of the horse."
11594,stretch,"“i kept asking [the smugglers] to stop to let me stretch my legs,” farah said, “but they wouldn’t."
11595,law,"fatemeh [faramarz’s sister’s pseudonym] and simin [her sister-in-law’s pseudonym] rubbed my legs until i could move them again.” the smugglers threatened them repeatedly, demanding more money, which they wisely refused to hand over."
11596,hole,"they were put in a stable, the only light a hole in the ceiling."
11597,death,"that night, as they snaked their way up a narrow path that plunged into a precipice, she considered the nearness of death: “a slip and i could easily roll down into the valley."
11598,law,we moved in that twilight area at the edge of the law.
11599,stretch,"their new guides stole their belongings and abandoned them by the side of the road, in a “flat, desert terrain that seemed to stretch forever.” without food, drink or shade, the baby and neda soon faced dehydration."
11600,locked,she tried to open the door and found it locked from the outside.
11601,locked,simin had locked the door to protect her.
11602,where,"where am i, and who are these people now ruling the streets?"
11603,question,"later, i told farah and mahnaz that sitting there alone in that diner, i revisited a question i had been asking myself for the past few years: what does it mean to be an american?"
11604,bail,"you can (at least for a while) bail out the financial giants, but no one seems much concerned with propping up the republic of imagination."
11605,taken,"when i returned shortly before two and joined the long queue waiting to get naturalization packages, i was in a mildly elated mood, although mindful that joy is transient and should not be taken too seriously."
11606,power,"i felt that i had the power to do a little “sivilizing” of my own, and this was for me the most exciting aspect of becoming american."
11607,taken,"it was obvious that, unlike me and the guy to my left, he had taken some trouble with his appearance."
11608,cell,"i knew he was arab, because i had overheard him speaking on his cell phone, but i don’t know how i discovered that the man to my left, who was not very receptive to joining in the conversation, was from latin america."
11609,law,"should i have asked him if he watched jon stewart, the simpsons, law & order or seinfeld?"
11610,building,i left the building and immediately called my husband to let him know that i was now the first american in the family.
11611,guilt,"could i tell him about my doubts, my arguments with myself, my joy, my guilt?"
11612,freedom,“i cannot remain indifferent.” the way she confronted the hurdles in this country and overcame what saul bellow called the “sufferings of freedom” was to my mind every bit as heroic as her struggle in the face of those other ordeals and hurdles in her country of birth.
11613,prisoners,"when the government finally announced the arrest of the amol group, families were allowed to meet with prisoners."
11614,trial,perhaps it was a sign that the trial would be delayed.
11615,state,"farah knew this was wishful thinking and that she was being unreasonable, but “reason,” she told mahnaz, “had nothing to do with the state of my mind.” i thought of farah when i first heard on the radio that a number of her former comrades had been arrested."
11616,execution,"the walls of the hall were draped with slogans against the defendants, who were seated on a stage facing the rowdy crowd that shouted insults at them and demanded their execution."
11617,lawyer,"they were not allowed a lawyer.” the judge was known as the “hanging judge,” because of the number of men and women he had sent to the gallows."
11618,defendants,"all of the defendants were accused of corruption of the earth, fighting against god and (of course), to crown it all, cooperating with the great satan."
11619,defendants,all of the defendants confessed to being communist and to mounting a plot against the regime.
11620,death,"after three weeks, they were all condemned to death."
11621,execution,farah thought that the execution would happen then.
11622,taken,“the baby was taken away.
11623,death,"but part of the experience of losing him involved carrying alone the burden of raising and supporting the children, a burden that would not allow me my time of mourning.” in her quiet and determined way, farah refused to let faramarz’s death destroy her."
11624,death,17 sometimes i felt as if my conversations with farah had a life-and-death quality to them—they had become so necessary both to farah and to me.
11625,war,"i told her i had this strange feeling, difficult to put into words, that although teaching huckleberry finn in iran was both rewarding and revealing, and although my students as a whole loved it, they focused mainly on the repressive aspects of the book, wanting to find fault with a society with which they were at war."
11626,where,"in my classes in iran, i had spent a fair amount of time discussing the confinements of life in a “civilized” society and made a point of drawing parallels with iran, with its rigid structures and conformity, where everything was done by the book—and it was always somebody else’s book."
11627,slavery,"i felt there was little difference between the mentality of slave owners who were in the habit of reminding skeptics that the bible approved of slavery and of islamists who claimed that islam approved of the repression of women and minorities and that the prophet, after all, was of the view that a woman’s testimony should be worth half that of a man."
11628,slavery,the lessons huck learns and unlearns go far beyond the immorality of slavery.
11629,freedom,"i didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and i wouldn’t done that one if i’d a knowed it would make him feel that way.” the real test arrives when huck contemplates the consequences of helping jim find freedom."
11630,freedom,"as jim believes he is nearing cairo and freedom—wrongly, it turns out—huck tells us, “my  conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever."
11631,where,"i’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’stead of calling me, so i could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog; and when i come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world, and the only one he’s got now; and then i happened to look around and see that paper."
11632,punishment,"with his rejection of the “sunday-school” mentality, he also rejects the utilitarian view of religion as a system of reward and punishment."
11633,power,"huck will find a new home and a new source of moral power, where the authority of the outside world is replaced with an inner authority, one that will help him decide what to do with jim."
11634,freedom,"this is the kind of individualism that shapes my idea of america, the one i tried to share with my students in tehran, explaining to them that moral choice comes from a sound heart and from a constant questioning of the world and of oneself, and that it is just as difficult, if not more so, in a society that appears to give you every freedom."
11635,death,"in his study of life in concentration camps, tzvetan todorov argues that even under the most adverse conditions, when human beings are at death’s door, they still have a choice."
11636,death,their ultimate choice lies in their attitude toward life and death.
11637,freedom,"it is in this manner that huck’s choice of hell and jim’s decision to risk his freedom in order to remain loyal are essentially choices to be true to that inner self, the rebellious heart that beats to its own rhythm."
11638,locked,"once huck discovers that the duke and the dauphin have betrayed jim for a paltry $45 and that jim is now locked up at the phelps farm (which happens to be home to tom’s aunt sally and her brood), he decides to go there to free jim."
11639,slavery,"i don’t want simply to bring up the questions we all know we have to ask, about slavery, humor, even americanism."
11640,where,"to become conscious of the world around them, because that is what i keep missing: the sensuality that at all periods of my life, no matter where i have lived, i could evoke through a poem, a painting, music or a story.” “let it be, azar,” farah said gently."
11641,court,"every morning for more than two weeks, i would take the metro to judiciary square and enter the supreme court of the district of columbia, where the main part of my day would be spent with eleven other jurors in a courtroom for the trial of a young african american man named vincent—known as v—for the murder of another african american man who was just thirty but still older than the accused by ten years."
11642,court,"i would avidly write down my questions, my doubts, my “verdict,” which kept changing, in the notebook provided by the court, even though, to my chagrin, we had these taken away from us each time we adjourned."
11643,case,"the case was about what had happened on the corner of h and 19th streets, among a group of young, mainly male african americans drinking grey goose vodka and at times breaking into fights."
11644,court,"i felt that i was participating in two kinds of justice: one in the court of my new country, and the other played out by the people in the streets of my country of birth."
11645,question,"i remember, at the time of the inauguration, a friend sent me a photograph of barack obama published in a persian paper, with a caption reading, “why can’t we have someone like this?” the paper was promptly shut down, and now, less than a year later, iranians protesting their own presidential elections were chanting, “obama, obama, are you with them or are you with us?” it was a question obama could never fully answer, no matter what he might have felt in his heart of hearts."
11646,power,"she asked me to tell her in minute detail about one of these, a meeting organized by jonathan safran foer, with toni morrison, samantha power, tony kushner and jhumpa lahiri."
11647,power,and so i dutifully related samantha power’s story of how obama had called to praise her book on genocide and then offered her a job in his office.
11648,inside,"i have not, as yet, wiped out her phone numbers and e-mail address from my computer, and every once in a while i visit her twitter account and hover over her last message: “iranians in wash. dc support our brave country men and women inside fighting for all of our rights."
11649,crime,"our hearts and minds are w/ you.”  20 “whatever the literary establishment might think, a good story always has a good ending.” so says jessica fletcher, that knowing and wise fictional murder mystery writer and amateur sleuth of the television series murder, she wrote who has never failed at solving a crime."
11650,where,"phelps farm is a reentry into the real world, where attempts will be made to make huck complicit in recapturing jim."
11651,where,"this feeling is reinforced when, a paragraph later, he informs us that he “heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then i knowed for certain i wished i was dead—for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world.” the phelps farm is a place where reality and illusion are tested."
11652,freed,then we learn that tom knew miss watson had already freed jim.
11653,slavery,it does nothing to erase the deeper prejudice bolstering the whole institution of slavery.
11654,slavery,twain knew only too well that slavery could be abolished and blacks would still be deprived of their rights.
11655,slavery,"for as long as the attitude that condoned and justified slavery remained, there would be lynching and segregation and the ku klux klan, and, as our own more recent experiences show, that same attitude can reappear clothed in different guises: as fascism, communism or islamism— or patriotism, for that matter, when it is wielded like a cudgel."
11656,slavery,he is not a religious fanatic and does not seem to be really bothered one way or the other about slavery.
11657,authority,"yet this does not mean that he is not influenced—or perhaps a better word is intimidated—by authority, especially tom’s authority."
11658,authority,"his courage is rooted in his heart, and he responds to an inner authority he does not know how to define."
11659,freed,"tom is the only one who knows that jim is a freeman, that miss watson freed him on her deathbed, and yet he is prepared to add to jim’s suffering by playing games in order to entertain himself."
11660,guard,"before we say goodbye to him, huck informs us that “tom’s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is.” parallel to tom’s unpardonable cruelty, there is jim and his unforgettable generosity."
11661,captive,"although we see jim mainly as a captive of his white masters and tom’s whims and fantasies, he takes over the story by refusing to act as they do, by refusing to be blind toward others or to be motivated by self-interest."
11662,freedom,"when tom is wounded and huck leaves the two of them to fetch a doctor, jim has a chance to run for freedom."
11663,where,"this is where hope lies: not in a rosy future for jim, whose next step, like everything else in the novel, is left unresolved, but in his refusal to act vindictively, thereby gaining true freedom from his oppressor."
11664,freedom,"freedom, like happiness, has to be pursued."
11665,civil rights,"“can you imagine,” she used to say, “my sister’s organization has a branch in kyrgystan, for heaven’s sake!” after the conferences we would spend hours dissecting the meetings and discussing our favorite participants: the legendary civil rights leader marianne wright edelman, mary robinson, rose styron, grace paley."
11666,where,"this time she wanted to hear about my first trip to the mantova book festival, where my old heroine muriel spark had adopted me."
11667,toilet,"she had invited me to her hotel, and all the time her mantra was “poor doris.” doris was doris lessing, who’d somehow had her flight  canceled in zurich or lausanne and was sent to italy on a bus with no toilet, all her luggage lost."
11668,notorious,"another time i told farah how salman rushdie, who had been a popular writer in iran until the notorious fatwa, had come to my table at a pen gala to graciously compliment me on my book, and i, in my zeal to tell him how much i admired his courage, fumbled and said something so convoluted that he thought i had said, “you deserved to die.” (what i had meant to say was that in iran, those targeted by the regime were particularly revered, and so with its fatwa the regime had in effect conferred on him iran’s highest honor.)"
11669,question,"at the hay festival, the writer lisa appignanesi laughingly asked me if it was true that i had told salman he deserved to die, and the question was repeated by others until i saw rushdie again and swore i’d never said any such thing, and he kindly and mischievously put his arm around my shoulder and said, “yes you did, yes you did, but it’s okay ."
11670,slavery,"contrary to what its ideologically inclined critics claim, the significance of huck finn is not only a matter of its position on slavery—although twain made his feelings on that subject abundantly clear—but of how it shifts responsibility for slavery onto us, ordinary people, who can so unwittingly participate in the implementation of unspeakable crimes."
11671,justice,"as the spanish novelist antonio muñoz molina once said, “if a member of the gestapo can have a normal face, then any normal face can belong to the gestapo.” for twain, the antidote to this propensity for evil is to be found not in extraordinary heroes—supermen and -women who risk all in search of justice—but in ordinary people, often ignored in real life but celebrated in american fiction."
11672,where,"the ordinary people, the small and meek, get their rewards in literature, where their moral courage, quietly celebrated, is enduring."
11673,killing,"huck introduced a new conception of individualism, far more complicated than that of the lone cowboy coming into town, killing off the black hats and moving on while sitting a little askew on his horse."
11674,justice,"huck and his progeny fight conformism, as well as the ayn randian concept of the superman who rises up against the inconsequential and vulgar mob and is free to implement his own self-serving conception of justice."
11675,racism,"huck finn is a scathing critique of the kind of society we live in today, not just because racism still exists or because we tolerate it passively, but because of the degree to which we have turned reality into entertainment and embraced the numbing, sanctimonious high-mindedness of miss watson’s facile indignation."
11676,where,"you can see huck’s progenies in hemingway, in faulkner, in fitzgerald and ellison and also very much in popular culture, in movies like mr. smith goes to washington, where our hero takes up the fight with all of congress and is told by the girl that only crazy characters like him are the real heroes."
11677,murder,"he followed in twain’s footsteps and did for the mystery—with “the simple art of murder”—what twain had done for the novel in his  denunciation of the sappy, maudlin stories of james fenimore cooper."
11678,justice,"he lives in shabby rented homes and dusty offices, his sole ambition to indulge his solitary passion: a search for justice."
11679,criminals,"his attitude toward both victims and criminals is complex, and he has genuine contempt, as does huck, for “respectable” society."
11680,crime,"he is seen by them as a “gumshoe,” he is condescended to, but it is he in the end who solves the crime, although his success is often bittersweet."
11681,crime,"in the long goodbye he takes up the job because of his empathy with the victim, the underdog, but sometimes his empathy deceives him and the victim turns out to be complicit in the crime."
11682,where,where chandler falls short is in making marlowe too perfect.
11683,police,"in marlowe’s world, you don’t get the girl; you give her up—because she is much wealthier than you are or because you discover in the end that she is a traitor and, although you love her, you will still call the police."
11684,crime,"crime is not just about evil, as hercule poirot and miss marple are so fond of reminding us."
11685,freedom,"but happiness and freedom do not always go together, because the idea of the novel, despite everything you hear about “happily ever after,” rests on the concept of the integrity of the individual, and that entails choice."
11686,crime,"in hammett and chandler, the detective protagonist is not a happy man—his success at solving the crime does not make him proud or self-satisfied, nor is he a success in the eyes even of those who hire him."
11687,power,"marlowe himself is a “perfectly equipped failure,” that american trope coined by henry james to describe characters who renounce worldly fame, wealth and power in order to follow the dictates of their own “sound heart,” which is, in fact, the most worthy of all achievements."
11688,taken,"i’ve read detective tales all my life; my father was also a fan, as the saying goes, and the two of us exchanged mystery books, but it was only after the revolution that i realized their significance, when, like so many things i had taken for granted, they suddenly became forbidden fruit."
11689,dictatorship,how could such a character be permitted in a dictatorship—someone who stands witness to police stupidity and (in the case of the american detective story) corruption in high places?
11690,criminal,it was as impossible to imagine as a drama like law & order in a country where both were sources of most criminal activities.
11691,war,"they said, “suppose the country is entering upon a war—where do you stand then?"
11692,war,if i thought it an unrighteous war i would say so.
11693,question,"the only way to light out, to see the “sivilized” world through fresh eyes, is through our imaginations, our hearts and our minds, and that is the real question for us: will we risk striking out for new territories and welcome the dangers of thoughts unknown?"
11694,liberty,part ii  “next to of course god america i love you land of the pilgrims’ and so forth oh say can you see by the dawn’s early my country ’tis of centuries come and go and are no more what of it we should worry in every language even deafanddumb thy sons acclaim your glorious name by gorry by jingo by gee by gosh by gum why talk of beauty what could be more beautiful than these heroic happy dead who rushed like lions to the roaring slaughter they did not stop to think they died instead then shall the voice of liberty be mute?” he spoke.
11695,justice,"no one seems to know what happened to tom blankenship, the real-life model for huck, but twain (perhaps apocryphally) claimed that tom sawyer grew up to be “respectable”—in fact, a justice of the peace, which wasn’t any better than a crook or a thief, at least in huck’s view."
11696,slavery,"born a generation after huck, hal grew up at a time when the untamed wilderness huck hoped to light out for was scarcer, the “smothery” villages had expanded into a new kind of smothery city, slavery was officially abolished and had been replaced by segregation, and new forms of hope and horror were coming into being."
11697,death,"i find it immensely poignant that upon his death, he left almost no personal possessions behind."
11698,case,"“the houses he bought one after another were mostly furnished houses; he walked in and he walked out.” gracie reported that when the contents of the thorvale farm, in williamstown, massachusetts, his last american home, were sold at auction in may 1952, among the six hundred items listed on the auction manifest, the only personal ones were “a leather traveling bag marked with an ‘l’ and covered with hotel labels, a large typewriter in a heavy leather case, an l-shaped desk and two tennis rackets.” a little old woman bid on the tennis rackets— she told gracie she’d wanted them for her two nephews, who needed to practice more—but someone else got them, for $18."
11699,case,"at an exhibition in his honor at the american academy of arts and letters in 1952, the memorabilia were: “bible, soft hat, walking stick, cigarette case, eyeshade, chess set, fountain pen.” there were no other keepsakes, no sentimental treasures, no things."
11700,liberty,"“have we no culture, no refinement,—but skill only to live coarsely and serve the devil?—to acquire a little worldly wealth, or fame, or liberty, and make a false show with it, as if we were all husk and shell, with no tender and living kernel to us?” thoreau wrote in a bitter critique of america that he published in the atlantic monthly in 1863."
11701,freed,"“even if we grant that the american has freed himself from a political tyrant, he is still the slave of an economical and moral tyrant."
11702,injustice,"it can be said that among the true guardians of american morality, its writers and thinkers have been the most steadfast, challenging readers to question complacent norms, to acknowledge injustice and recognize the underside of this heaving, thrusting, purposeful nation dedicated to making ever more new things."
11703,confinement,"in life, he resented “the ghetto-like confinement” of the small town, calling it the “village virus.” in his first blockbuster bestseller, main street, he gave us an idealist, carol kennicott, the wife of the village doctor, who tries to rectify the mercantile mentality of main street america through a futile attempt to beautify and vitalize her small town of gopher prairie."
11704,establishment,"if we agree with ezra pound that “literature is news that stays news,” then we can safely say that sinclair lewis was, despite his poor standing in the literary establishment, the ultimate american novelist."
11705,law,"unlike his creator, mr. babbitt, or “georgie,” as his wife, myra, affectionately calls him, is a solid, hardworking, god-fearing family man who shares a prosperous real estate business with his father-in-law."
11706,where,"he comes from a small town but has moved on to better things, an affluent life in a flourishing city, enabling him to view his place of birth, even his close relatives, with affectionate scorn as “the hicks back home.” babbitt can claim to belong to that blessed community of self-made american men who have worked hard to get where they are and, by golly, the world should know how proud they are of their achievements!"
11707,where,soon we will discover that being a self-made man has little to do with independence or individualism: for men like babbitt to get where they are requires a gradual surrender of the self to a higher ideal.
11708,where,"but to babbitt every inch was individual and stirring.” unlike huck finn, where the break with the past was a deliberate act of liberation, here attitudes toward the past are more in tune with henry ford’s dictum that “history is bunk.” the new buildings seem to have arisen out of a void."
11709,tortured,"all vestiges of the past, the “fretted structures of earlier generations,” the post office with “its shingle-tortured mansard,” the “red brick minarets of hulking old houses,” the factories that have “stingy and sooted windows” and the “wooden tenements colored like mud,” are mere “grotesqueries,” in deliberate contrast to the “shining new houses” of fortunate souls like babbitt who have made it."
11710,stir,"before he is fully awake, that alarm clock is described in great detail: early in the novel we are invited to recognize that this all-american businessman, a defender of individualism and free trade, is best defined not by any peculiarity of temperament or cherished keepsake but by his ownership of the best of the “nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments,” making its owner “proud of being awakened by such a rich device.” in terms of social status, it is “almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires.” once babbitt begins to stir, we follow him from the sleeping porch through his bedroom to the bathroom."
11711,where,"the shiny and meticulous quality of the surfaces produces a spooky refracted light of the kind we will later come across in films such as the truman show and american beauty, where a fabricated reality intrudes on the protagonists’ souls."
11712,pen,"the objects babbitt transfers from one suit to another—a fountain pen, a silver pencil, a gold penknife, a silver cigar cutter, seven keys all hanging from his watch chain—are of “eternal importance” to him, “like baseball or the republican party.” without them, he feels “naked.” next we meet myra babbitt, george’s loyal wife."
11713,building,"surveying the top of the second national tower, a building thirty-five stories high, he is inspired “by the rhythm of the city” and beholds “the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men; and as he clumped down to breakfast he whistled the ballad ‘oh, by gee, by gosh, by jingo’ as though it were a hymn melancholy and noble.”  4 the first time i read babbitt, during my college days, i associated it with e. e. cummings’s poem “next to of course god, america i.” i loved cummings and felt i had found the poetic equivalent of the “babbitt experience.” at the time, i had little connection to the world outside my university, and i was too embroiled in its politics to care to know much about america beyond its precincts."
11714,state,"this time i saw things i had missed, the complications and paradoxes of being an american, or of life in a democracy, now that i found myself living in a totalitarian state."
11715,question,"“what the country needs—just at this present juncture—is neither a college president nor a lot of monkeying with foreign affairs, but a good—sound economical—business— administration, that will give us a chance to have something like a decent turnover.” this is not a speech by mitt romney, george bush or a conservative talking head on hannity; it is babbitt’s neighbor and friend howard littlefield, responding to babbitt’s question “don’t you think it’s about time we had a real business administration?” littlefield is “the great scholar,” with a b.a."
11716,authority,"he is an “authority on everything in the world except babies, cooking, and motors.” his real job, however, is as the “employment-manager and publicity-counsel of the zenith street traction company.” there is a strict, if largely unspoken, hierarchy in zenith."
11717,power,"there are those above babbitt in wealth and power, the ones he aspires one day to join—they belong not to the athletic club, as babbitt and his regular cronies like littlefield do, but to the union club, a notch above it, classier and more posh."
11718,state,"right above them is old money, represented by william washington eathorne, president of the first state bank of zenith."
11719,state,"“out of the dozen contradictory zeniths which together make up the true and complete zenith, none is so powerful and enduring yet none so unfamiliar to the citizens as the small, still, dry, polite, cruel zenith of the william eathornes; and for that tiny hierarchy the other zeniths unwittingly labor and insignificantly die.” it is not politics that rules babbitt’s world—this is not the soviet union or the islamic republic of iran, where the state reshapes its citizens’ social, cultural and personal lives."
11720,state,there is nothing complicated about the brute force of an ideological state.
11721,power,"novelists, who are in the business of joy, passion and wisdom, were the first to grasp the power of advertising and technology in their best and worst forms."
11722,guilt,"these and thousands of the other products we have come to depend on evoke passion, guilt, anxiety."
11723,cell,"i can imagine standing in one of those interminable lines with a babbitt-like figure waiting for the latest iphone and sharing his “enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all mechanical devices.” how many owners of a mac who look nothing like babbitt and might strongly disapprove of his lifestyle would feel, with him, that these devices are “symbols of truth and beauty?” anyone who has gazed with longing at a clean, well-lighted apple store on her way to work may understand why babbitt yearns “for a dictaphone, for a typewriter which would add and multiply, as a poet yearns for quartos or a physician for radium.” in fact, our relationships with our cell phones and ipads are far more intimate than babbitt’s to his gadgets."
11724,question,"the gadgets in question have changed, but the mentality that packages them and buys them is basically the same."
11725,cell,"what are my exact grievances against my laptop, cell phone and now my ipad?"
11726,power,"stuffed like a christmas goose as babbitt is, with silly films, silly newspapers, silly talk, silly oratory, there has yet struck him the majestic creativeness of his own country, its miraculous power to bear and nourish without end countless multitudes of men and women."
11727,lawyer,"[t]here is in these people a vitality so intense that it must eventually bolt with them and land them willy-nilly into the sphere of intelligence; and this immense commercial machine will become the instrument of their aspiration.” interestingly enough, it is seneca doane, the radical lawyer, friend of the workingman and astute critic of zenith and its corrupt leaders, who most understands and appreciates this intense vitality."
11728,where,"responding to a foreign friend who condescendingly criticizes american conformity, doane reminds him that there is standardization in every country: in england (“every house that can afford it having the same muffins at the same tea-hour”), in france (with its “sidewalk cafes”) and italy (where the “love-making” is standardized)."
11729,cell,"we may laugh at babbitt as he irritates us and invites our sympathy, but what is at stake is not just a matter of socks, shoes, cell phones and alarm clocks; the real danger lies in the commodification of our souls."
11730,state,"but he does not see why “shakespeare and those” are required for college or “why they stuck ’em into an up-to-date high-school system like we have in this state.” he believes it would be better if “you took business english, and learned how to write an ad, or letters that would pull.” this argument is now all too familiar: learning “shakespeare and those” won’t help you pull in a paycheck down the road."
11731,law,"despite ted’s dislike of college and his desire to take up “mechanics,” babbitt wants him to go to college and study law—no doubt because when he was young, his own ambition, derailed by his unexpected marriage, was to become a lawyer."
11732,power,"if you’re going to law-school—and you are!—i never had a chance to, but i’ll see that you do—why, you’ll want to lay in all the english and latin you can get.” babbitt is a fan of home-study courses, “which the energy and foresight of american commerce have contributed to the science of education.” these courses entice the discerning mind with advertisements that begin like this: $$$$$$$$$ power and prosperity in public speaking one in particular is taught by professor w. f. peet, “author of the shortcut course in public-speaking” and “easily the foremost figure in practical literature, psychology & oratory.” babbitt figures that this “correspondence-school business had become a mighty profitable game.” we now have many versions of homeschooling, where the student does not have to actually attend school but can pay an online provider to get a degree."
11733,state,"a heated controversy has broken out in education circles in the past few years over the “common core state standards,” new guidelines released in 2010 and now endorsed by fortyfive states and the district of columbia."
11734,where,"where bush opted for sticks, obama chose to lure with carrots, and so congress allocated an additional $5 billion to the department of education, and “race to the top” was born."
11735,state,"for high schools, the required ratio was set at 70/30 in favor of informational texts, which range from plato’s allegory of the cave to ronald reagan’s 1988 speech at moscow state university to material from the san  francisco federal reserve bank."
11736,jail,"now, don’t get me wrong: i would have welcomed a more interdisciplinary approach, one in which martin luther king jr.’s “letter from birmingham jail” might be taught alongside james baldwin’s go tell it on the mountain and poems by langston hughes, but this was not the intention."
11737,poverty,"our public schools, especially in poverty-ridden neighborhoods, have been under pressure to give up music, arts, literature and all the subjects related to the humanities."
11738,state,"i begrudgingly took note that the humanities were pointedly absent from the president’s last state of the union speech, while mathematics, science and engineering at least got an honorable mention."
11739,state,"in a speech to the national governors association emphasizing the importance of using data-based metrics to increase educational standards and bring down the costs in k-12 education, gates noted: “the amount of subsidization is not that well correlated to the areas that actually create jobs in the state—that create income for the state."
11740,state,"now, in the past it felt fine to just say, okay, we’re overall going to be generous with this sector,” but now, he said, we should ask, “what are the categories that help fill jobs and drive that state’s economy in the future?” his response to this rhetorical question was perhaps self-evident, but should we really be surprised to hear this soul-crushing evaluation from a man who has argued that donating money to a new museum wing, rather than spending it on preventing an illness such as blindness, is morally equivalent to saying, “we’re going to take 1 percent of the people who visit this [museum] and blind them”?"
11741,question,“do people know the two most popular forms of writing in the american high school today?” a group of educators was asked rhetorically in a question-and-answer session shortly after the release of the common core.
11742,conviction,"that is, it was our insistence in the standards process that it was not enough to say you wanted to or thought that kids should know these things, that you had to have evidence to support it, frankly because it was our conviction that the only way to get an eraser into the standards writing room was with evidence behind it, ’cause otherwise the way standards are written you get all the adults into the room about what kids should know, and the only way to end the meeting is to include everything."
11743,state,that’s how we’ve gotten to the typical state standards we have today.
11744,law,"knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.” most of the founders were proficient in greek and latin, and benjamin rush, the patron of america’s first public schools, recommended the study of the “dead languages” as central to the practitioners of “law, physic or divinity.” it now occurs to me that johnson, should he wish to know more about the foundations of his country, might want to spend more time reading locke and cicero than “informational texts” like “recommended levels of insulation,” issued by the environmental protection agency, and the “invasive plant inventory,” courtesy of the california invasive plant council."
11745,term,"anyone, especially nowadays, can find information about almost anything in the world with a few keystrokes on google, but not everyone can understand the nuances of that information, and even fewer will have the patience to place it in a relevant context or to be objective enough, responsible enough and passionate enough about the truth not to mind what its discovery might mean for their beliefs or short-term benefits."
11746,roads,"in fact, in a letter to joel barlow in 1807, he wote, “people generally have more feeling for canals and roads than education."
11747,term,"however, i hope we can advance them with equal pace.” he knew there could be no innovation and progress, no canals and roads, in the long term without a well-rounded education."
11748,exercise,"it asks for passages from ovid, the gettysburg address, romeo and juliet and epa reports all to be taught in the same manner, a dry and brittle exercise that takes no account of the need, as even babbitt understood, for a little “vision” and fantasy."
11749,justice,"and if he had stuck with that history  lesson, he might also have learned that every movement for equality and justice—the civil rights movement, the women’s rights movement, the environmental movement and, more recently, the gay rights movement—was affected (or perhaps “infected” is a more suitable word) by this same spirit."
11750,authority,"in a letter to mathew robinson jr. in 1786, he addresses robinson’s ideas on “american affairs” and begins by expressing hope that a time will come when the “sciences and the art of government” will be rid of superstition and imposture and “authority” will come from the people and not from the “the skies in miracles and mistery.” adams continues, explaining that before such time arrives and before any great things are accomplished, a memorable change must be made in the system of education and knowledge must become so general as to raise the lower ranks of society nearer to the higher."
11751,federal,"there should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves.” so much for rand paul’s contention that schools are fine and great but should not be funded by the federal government."
11752,state,"speaking of senator paul’s state, kentucky, he might be interested to know that in 1822 james madison commended the state of kentucky for appropriating funds for a general system of education."
11753,power,"knowledge will forever govern ignorance: and a people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.” by now it should be clear to johnson that prosperity and enlightenment were the two pillars of both the idea of america and the american dream, and the most important achievement of american pragmatism was to recognize that one could not survive without the other."
11754,state,"“if a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization,” jefferson remarked, “it expects what never was and never will be.” “liberty” and “knowledge”: one finds these two words repeated time and again in the early years of the republic."
11755,roads,"they knew the value of engineers, of people who build roads, canals and bridges, but they also knew that dictatorships could build roads, canals and bridges, and they believed that what a free society needed was an enlightened and civic-minded public that could prevent tyranny from taking root."
11756,state,"in our american republics, where [government] is in the hands of the people, knowledge should be universally diffused by means of public schools.” he believed that “the more generally knowledge is diffused among the substantial yeomanry, the more perfect will be the laws of a republican state.” and here is madison: “learned institutions ."
11757,liberty,"throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty & dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.”  why was giordano bruno burned at the stake, and why did galileo face the inquisition?"
11758,freedom,"to a writer, a philosopher, a teacher, a musician or an artist, freedom of expression is like bread and water—it is that without which they cannot survive."
11759,jail,"what these societies lack—what citizens in iran and china go to jail and are tortured for, what tyrants are afraid of when they talk about western democracies—is not technology or scientific prowess but a culture of democracy, a culture that understands and respects freedom of expression, of ideas, of imagination."
11760,jail,the only engineers and computer scientists in jail in totalitarian societies are the ones who speak their minds.
11761,freedom,"he wanders into his daughter’s room, trying to amuse himself, and finds her books: conrad’s the rescue, a book of “quite irregular poetry” by vachel lindsay, and “highly improper essays” by h. l. mencken that poke fun at “the church and all the decencies.” he dislikes these books, finding in them “a spirit of rebellion against niceness and solid-citizenship.” one can see why babbitt would be both attracted to the joys of freedom and frightened by its perils, for freedom does have many perils, and the best way to confront them is not to avoid being free but to cultivate independence of thought, the kind of freedom that, incidentally, has been the great engine of american creativity and vitality in all fields, from engineering to literature."
11762,where,"what every reader has in common with babbitt is that, like him, we are faced with choices, from trivial matters like choosing toothpaste to decisions about what to do, whom to see or be, where to live or work."
11763,freedom,freedom of choice lies at the heart of every democratic society.
11764,exercise,"against the onslaught of consumerism, against all the overwhelming siren voices that beckon, our only weapon is to exercise our right to choose."
11765,war,"if he is to be a good and upstanding citizen, johnson will need to understand what it means for his country to go to war and what kind of peace is a just peace."
11766,where,"who knows, if his boss were to ask him to do something that he considered immoral, he might even, without fear, tell him where to go."
11767,power,"and should he be free, despite the new curriculum, to follow his curiosity, he might learn—  to quote the immortal words of william stoner, the eponymous hero of john williams’s stoner, an anti-babbitt if ever there was one—that “as his mind engaged itself with its subject, as it grappled with the power of the literature he studied and tried to understand its nature, he was aware of a constant change within himself; and as he was aware of that, he moved outward from himself into the world which contained him, so that he knew that the poem of milton’s that he read or the essay of bacon’s or the drama of ben jonson’s changed the world which was its subject, and changed it because of its dependence upon it.”  9 paralisi cardiaca: these are the words inscribed in the records of the clinica electra, on the outskirts of rome, explaining the cause of death for america’s fugitive nobel laureate."
11768,question,"he is dreaming again “of the fairy child, a dream more romantic than scarlet pagodas by a silver sea.” this fairy child, “so slim, so white, so eager,” awaits him in “the darkness beyond mysterious groves,” until he can get away from his “crowded house” and his “clamoring friends.” she believes in him, soothes him, cries that he is “gay and valiant, that she would wait for him, that they would sail—” but here his romantic thoughts are interrupted as life intrudes into his dream: “rumble and bang of the milk-truck.” babbitt asks himself one question: why?"
11769,where,"he can find only one response: “i don’t know.” perhaps the answer is simply the fact that “he who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day.” this is where the heart comes in, to help babbitt find an answer, or perhaps to disturb him and deprive him of his sense of complacency, to warn him that he does have a choice—there are alternatives to his way of life."
11770,gang,"panic comes to him in unexpected places, like a series of short strokes followed by minor epiphanies, as when, in the midst of a party with his gang of good fellows and their wives, they decide to hold a séance and summon the “wop poet” dante, “the fellow that took the cook’s tour to hell.” suddenly and in the “impersonal darkness,” the “curst discontent” revisits him, and his friends’ hackneyed jokes at the expense of the poet’s “spirit” are no longer funny to babbitt."
11771,freedom,"instead, “for many hours, for a bleak eternity,” he stays awake, “shivering, reduced to primitive terror, comprehending that he had won freedom, and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so embarrassing as freedom.” when his wife and daughter tinka leave him to visit relatives, he is “free to do—he was not quite sure what.” he wanders around the silent house, asking himself what he wants."
11772,freedom,"“it was  coming to him that perhaps all life as he knew it and vigorously practised it was futile; that heaven as portrayed by the reverend dr. john jennison drew was neither probable nor very interesting; that he hadn’t much pleasure out of making money.” and so babbitt tramps in “forlorn and unwanted freedom,” childishly desiring the company of the fairy child."
11773,injustice,sinclair lewis introduced a different kind of fear into american fiction: not the cosmic challenges of melville or the puritan qualms of hawthorne or the very real physical dangers of twain or the insecurities and fears induced by poverty and injustice in dreiser.
11774,freedom,"alfred kazin describes this other kind of fear, the one that is part of our everyday life, rooted in our terror of freedom at the very moment we most desire it: “there is indeed more significant terror of a kind in lewis’s novels than in a writer like faulkner or the hard-boiled novelists, for it is the terror immanent in the commonplace, the terror that arises out of the repressions, the meanness, the hard jokes of the world lewis had soaked into his pores.” lewis had something in common with his protagonist."
11775,where,"while reading babbitt, interrupted by the clamor of a world that at times appears ever more like david coleman’s dream universe, where “people don’t really give a shit about what you feel or what you think,” i was reminded of my conversation with ramin in seattle."
11776,power,"in it, he reminds us that neither babbitt himself nor what he represents will go away in the foreseeable future, and that his life and dissatisfaction have lessons for every one of us as we face that vital moment of choice: the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along on the fuel of fear and anger and frustration and craving and the worship of self."
11777,freedom,our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom.
11778,freedom,"the freedom all to be lords of our tiny, skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation."
11779,freedom,this kind of freedom has much to recommend it.
11780,freedom,"but of course, there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious, you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and displaying."
11781,freedom,"the really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty, unsexy little ways, every day."
11782,freedom,that is real freedom.
11783,death,"none of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big, fancy questions of life after death."
11784,death,the capital-t truth is about life before death.
11785,lawyer,"paul is the only person who shares babbitt’s past and his dreams, for babbitt once wanted to be a lawyer, a governor maybe, a champion of the poor and the oppressed, before he married the good-hearted and placid myra and became a salaryman."
11786,thief,"when he sees paul, babbitt is “neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the lyte-purdy conference, nor the blaring good fellow, the josher and regular guy, of the athletic club.” they shake hands solemnly and smile “as shyly as though they had been parted three years not three days,” greeting each other: “how’s the old horse-thief?” “all right, i guess."
11787,jail,"when paul is discovered by his wife he tries to kill her, wounds her instead, goes to jail and dies."
11788,lawyer,"at first he attempts to avoid the radical lawyer, but gradually he realizes that doane is a human being like any other, who enjoys dancing and pretty women, only he also likes to see “the meetings of the garment workers held at the ritz, with a dance afterward."
11789,lawyer,"in those days, doane tells babbitt, he was “an unusually liberal, sensitive chap.” he adds that at the time, babbitt used to tell him that he intended to be “a lawyer, and take the cases of the poor for nothing, and fight the rich,” and that doane would be “one of the rich,” buying paintings and living in newport."
11790,lawyer,"next he takes a more dangerous step by speaking rebelliously at the athletic club, defending and quoting the radical lawyer."
11791,taken,but it is when she becomes sick and has to be taken to the hospital and operated on that babbitt finally gives in.
11792,death,"“instantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the spiritual dramas through which he struggled became pallid and absurd before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and traditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and the thousand steadfast implications of married life.” and so “he crept back to her.” as he kneels down before his wife, before she is taken to the hospital, he knows clearly and swiftly that he will have “no more wild evenings.” he is honest enough to admit that he will miss them."
11793,where,"at the party where babbitt and his friends try to summon the spirit of “the wop poet,” dante, for a minute babbitt has, “without explanation, the impression of a slaggy cliff and on it, in silhouette against menacing clouds, a lone and austere figure.” and that is where the hope lies: no matter how many utilitarian business-minded educators may try to erase the image of the poet, to make it irrelevant, it will endure."
11794,question,"this is a question that occupied my imagination in my own college days when, at some point between sophomore and junior years, i started hanging out with a tall, lanky girl with mousy hair and wonderful long legs with whom i carried on intense and at times heated discussions about art, literature and a boy named ben holder."
11795,term,"i first met her in an art history class when our young teacher, unabashedly biased in favor of modern art, introduced us to mark rothko and claes oldenberg, but we spent most of our time talking about fiction—southern fiction, if you will, though at the time i was almost allergic to the term."
11796,where,"for her it was a short pause before going east—that was her destination, though she never really specified where in the east she was heading."
11797,war,"he had been president of students for a democratic society and was active in the committee to end the war in vietnam, and he made sure we all knew that in the sixties he had participated in the civil rights movement."
11798,where,he never told me where he was coming from or where he was headed; he would just turn around and start walking with me.
11799,war,"those short walks, which generally ended at ernie’s town tavern and once or twice at the library bar, were the only occasions when mike and i discussed matters other than those pertaining to the vietnam war or the civil rights movement."
11800,case,(he was the one who interested me in the case of the scottsboro boys and the history of protest around them.)
11801,term,"joanna would from time to time sit in on my english class, and when she did she talked a great deal, usually managing to bring the topic back to what she called the “southern climate”—a term she used in both its literal and metaphorical senses."
11802,where,"i thought she was overly focused on where a writer happened to have been born, through no fault of his or her own."
11803,sentence,"joanna tolerated my objections in silence, waiting for me to finish my sentence so that she could return to her point."
11804,death,"); a throwaway remark by a student— (“oh, her—we read that book in high school; what’s the point of her?”); someone’s use of the word “freaks”; but perhaps most of all, the unexpected news and circumstances of mike’s death."
11805,where,"maybe in choosing to write about carson mccullers today, i am trying in part to retrieve the freedom and enchantment of those youthful conversations, when it was possible to seriously fight and fall out over a novel, only to make up, mainly in order to pick up the fight where we had left off."
11806,term,"joanna was the one who led me to coin the term “southern syndrome,” which i later amended to the more specific “joanna’s carson mccullers syndrome.” at some point it became our carson mccullers syndrome, and now it is all mine."
11807,death,"there is something in the quality of his prose that captures this twilight effect, at once beautiful and sad, in ruins and yet eternal, like the voice of addie bundren in as i lay dying coming to us after her death."
11808,industrial,"it is not the same sun as the one we find lighting the way for huck and jim or beating down on the poverty-ridden sharecroppers in erskine caldwell’s tobacco road, documenting the cruel transition to industrial farming, a transformation responsible for another kind of poverty, another kind of loneliness."
11809,where,"the heart is a lonely hunter is an urban story, unmistakably set in the south, but this is a south where the sense of community and familial affinities are broken, where even exploitation has taken on a new tone and texture."
11810,war,"economically and in other ways it has been used as a sort of colony to the rest of the nation.” in the year that america entered the second world war, mccullers proclaimed that modern southern writing was “the progeny of the russian realists,” an affinity she attributed to the strikingly similar circumstances under which the two societies functioned: “in both old russia and the south up to the present time a dominant characteristic was the cheapness of human  life,” she wrote."
11811,state,"industrial organization has made no headway at all among the workers in the town,” who are “conditioned to a very apathetic, listless state.” rather than blame himself for his own misfortune, the worker turns on the “only social group beneath him—the negro.” from this skeletal description grew that haunting town somewhere in “the middle of the deep south,” whose stagnant air carries something of the dangerous and dusty heat of the phelps farm in huckleberry finn."
11812,war,"faulkner, o’connor, richard wright, erskine caldwell—they were born in the only part of america that had lost a war and been occupied, a loss that remained central to their self-definition."
11813,war,"whenever i would mention a protest meeting or the war in vietnam she would shake her head and lean forward, as if ready to physically cut me off, and then she would change the subject to what she really wanted to talk about."
11814,building,"he and joanna represented two poles of my existence in norman, one having to do with art and literature, fellini, bergman and playing the guitar, and the other with protests, taking over the administration building, long meetings and singing old labor songs."
11815,charged,"“inner isolation,” “man’s revolt,” “the urge to express”—these are charged words, both intense and abstract, almost intimidating, but what endures is a compelling human drama and not an existential thesis concocted by a precocious twenty-year-old who, aside from a short trip to new york, had only ever been to charlotte, north carolina."
11816,tortured,"yet she did touch on all of those abstractions, with the ruthless eye of a writer, accomplishing what one of her characters, biff brannon, strives for, which is “to store up a whole lot of details and then come upon something real.” there is something about each one of her four principal characters that is slightly off,  slightly self-tortured, as they struggle to understand the meaning of life and to give their own lives meaning."
11817,taken,"“because of their loneliness,” mccullers writes in her outline, these four “see in the mute a certain mystic superiority and he becomes in a sense their ideal.” singer himself has a parallel relationship with another deaf-mute, antonapoulos, who is his roommate and only friend until he begins to behave strangely and is taken to a mental hospital in another city."
11818,question,"some of my students over the years have asked me, “what’s the point of reading these books?” or “how will they help me solve my problems?” the question is not generally posed in such stark terms, but that is the gist of it."
11819,question,"often, in response, i will turn the question back to them: what is it that we are looking for when we read a novel?"
11820,case,"i am tempted to quote nabokov: “fancy is fertile only when it is futile.” if our main expectation from a work of fiction is that it be factually correct or that it correlate to real life, that it cure us of our anxieties, improve our relationships with our mothers—in short, be aspirin for the soul—then we risk treating the novel as nothing more than a manual, in this case a manual for understanding deaf people—with not very successful results, because, unlike the former miss america, singer does not feel his life to be full of “blessings” and does not say, “i am happy even though i’m deaf.” singer is real."
11821,case,"i was of course well aware of flannery o’connor’s statement that “anything that comes out of the south is going to be called grotesque by the northern reader, unless it is grotesque, in which case it is going to be called realistic.” according to mccullers’s first biographer, virginia spencer carr, her mother claimed that she, while pregnant, had been “alerted by the oracles that her firstborn would be unique.” she was convinced the child would be a boy and decided to name him enrico caruso, in honor of the famous singer."
11822,term,"oprah’s book club called her a “southern belle,” a term that would have amused more than irritated her."
11823,war,"he sent a telegram to his wife in nyack, new york, saying, “going west—trunks on the way.” during the first world war, when a man felt his death was imminent, he would say he was “going west.” reeves was found dead the next day—he had committed suicide in his hotel room, alone."
11824,death,"after reeves’s tragic death, carson tried to banish him from her life."
11825,death,"in between surgeries and writing, carson found ample time to tend to her social life and keep up with her friends—good oldfashioned american sturdiness, giving the finger to both life and death, something so little encouraged today, so little appreciated."
11826,death,"a few months before her death, in the spring of 1967, carson traveled to ireland to meet the director john huston, who was making a film of her book reflections in a golden eye, starring elizabeth taylor and marlon brando."
11827,court,"she read joyce, o’casey and yeats while holding court from her bed for a whole host of people who wanted to visit the famous american author."
11828,state,"perhaps nowhere does she combine this childlikeness and childishness, this state of protracted adolescence, which she invoked time and again to describe her native south, as effectively as in the heart is a lonely hunter."
11829,question,"we wander, question."
11830,seclusion,"i am reminded of elizabeth cady stanton’s short and searing pamphlet “the solitude of the self,” in which she proclaims that the need for equal rights comes innately from the seclusion of every woman in america who is born alone, is solely responsible for her own life and will die alone."
11831,prisoner,"cady stanton begins her essay by championing “the individuality of each human soul” and goes on to elaborate why every woman must live “in a world of her own, the arbiter of her own destiny, an imaginary robinson crusoe with her woman friday on a solitary island.”  in words that are more poetic and anguished than ideological and polemical, she writes, “the isolation of every human soul and the necessity of self-dependence must give each individual the right to choose his own surroundings.” then she relates how she once asked prince kropotkin, a russian political prisoner, “how he endured his long years in prison, deprived of books, pen, ink, and paper.” he responded, “in the pursuit of an idea i took no note of time."
11832,jailer,"when tired of solving knotty problems i recited all the beautiful passages in prose or verse i had ever learned.” he had a “world of my own, a vast empire, that no russian jailer or czar could invade.” mccullers was deeply musical, and in her outline she writes that the novel’s form is “contrapuntal throughout.” she goes on to explain: “like a voice in a fugue each one of the main characters is an entirety in himself—but his personality takes on a new richness when contrasted and woven in with the other characters in the book.” the main characters all suffer from an inner isolation."
11833,where,what disturbs me most about these photographs is that the youth seem to have no consciousness of where they are or whom they are with.
11834,question,"“for a baby,” mccullers writes, “the question of identity shares urgency with the need for milk."
11835,civil rights,i reminded mike of how he had taught me about woody guthrie and told me about his participation in the civil rights movement.
11836,taken,"i said i had thought of him and our conversation about african american writers and the civil rights movement when my first published work, a translation of two poems by langston hughes, came out and later when i wrote an introduction to richard wright’s american hunger, a book i had taken with me to iran."
11837,civil rights,"“we’ve come a long way from the civil rights movement,” he said."
11838,war,"“it all started with reagan,” he said, casting his eyes about him now, “followed by bush and the gulf war.” mike had always talked a lot, but as time went by, most of those who had listened or pretended to listen dispersed and left, and he was left talking to fewer people and then mainly to himself."
11839,jail,his “enemy” did not kill him or put him in jail; it simply ignored him.
11840,poverty,"11 what connects a restaurant owner, a drunken agitator from out of town, an african american doctor and a young teenage girl living on the edge of poverty?"
11841,question,"“the question flowed through biff, always, unnoticed, like the blood in his veins."
11842,question,"he thought of people and of objects and of ideas and the question was in him.” the word is echoed throughout the story, gradually gaining volume as it takes on a more universal meaning."
11843,where,"biff is the only one who pays any attention to where he lives, who takes care of his home and makes it presentable."
11844,inside,"the summer night is “black” and “sultry,” it is midnight and all the streetlights have been turned off, so “the light from the café made a sharp, yellow rectangle on the sidewalk.” the streets are deserted, and inside, the café is busy with the half dozen customers drinking while biff waits “stolidly, his elbow resting on the counter and his thumb mashing the tip of his long nose.” as is his habit, he is watching."
11845,case,"i had discovered the metaphorical use of the word “dazzle”—both jake blount and mick kelly are dazzled by the glare of the sun, which seems to follow them almost like a fury in greek mythology, in sync with their inner urges or, in jake’s case, his indecipherable rage."
11846,term,he was like a man who had served a term in prison or had been to harvard college or had lived for a long time with foreigners in south america.
11847,where,"when someone objects to his bringing this man to a place where white men drink, jake responds, “i’m part nigger myself,” and goes on to say, “i’m part nigger and hop and bohunk and chink."
11848,authorities,"their protest was implied in their description of how they were forced to live, struggling to keep clean and find a safe place to sleep, how they avoided being discovered by the authorities and worried about the consequences—one problem, you see, is that to go to school you have to have a permanent address, and of course they had none."
11849,taken,mick has taken her two younger brothers out for a walk.
11850,building,she set off with her brothers for a building site.
11851,where,"when she got there, she left the boys and started climbing a ladder to the top, where she stood up “very straight."
11852,where,this was the place where everybody wanted to stand.
11853,inside,"sometimes she hummed to herself as she walked, and other times she listened quietly to the songs inside her."
11854,building,"on that day, alone in the unfinished building, mick dreams about how, when she is seventeen and very famous, she will write her initials, m.k., on everything, how she will drive a red and white packard with her initials on the doors, how she will have them on her handkerchief and underwear."
11855,wall,"she has recently discovered one fellow whose music “made her heart shrink up every time she heard it.” the fellow is called something like “motsart.” standing in the empty room, she takes two stubs of chalk out of her pocket, one green and the other red, and writes on the wall, in big block letters, “edison, and under that she drew the names of dick tracy and mussolini."
11856,wall,"finally, on the opposite wall, she “wrote a very bad word—pussy.” she hums one of the tunes she remembers, “and after a while in the hot, empty house by herself she felt the tears come in her eyes."
11857,justice,"twenty-five years later, mccullers wrote that in her first book she had tackled several moral problems, most notably “the problems of prejudice and poverty in the south.” jake represents the search for social and economic justice, but it is in the figure of benedict mady copeland, the most critically acclaimed character in the novel, that we find a man grappling with the most enduring of all urges: the desire for dignity, both for his race and for himself."
11858,justice,"in the august 1940 issue of the new republic, richard wright compared mccullers to faulkner, writing, “to me the most impressive aspect of ‘the heart is a lonely hunter’ is the astonishing humanity that enables a white writer, for the first time in southern fiction, to handle negro characters with as much ease and justice as those of her own race."
11859,injustice,"he did not wholly understand the intricate play of ideas and the complex phrases, but as he read he sensed a strong, true purpose behind the words and he felt that he almost understood.” dr. copeland is an educated man, familiar with spinoza and karl marx, an honest and hardworking physician, and yet the sense of injustice is so strong and deep in him that he cannot find the words to express it."
11860,freedom,"he pushed the words into the sick and patient faces of the negroes who were his people.” dr. copeland’s father was a preacher, and his mother a slave who, after securing her freedom, became a washerwoman."
11861,law,"his father-in-law, a crafty tenant farmer and the family patriarch, explains to his children that while working the fields, he likes to dream of jesus appearing to him and his telling jesus that “us is all sad colored peoples.” jesus would then place “his holy hand upon our heads and straightway us will be white as cotton.” portia’s husband, highboy, when sick with pneumonia, had seen god’s face looking at him through the fireplace, and god had “a large white man’s face with a white beard and blue eyes.” dr. copeland, listening to them, “felt the old evil anger in him."
11862,arrest,"the police arrest him and send him to prison, and from there to a chain gang near atlanta, and then the family hears that he and two of his friends whom a white guard kept picking on had been punished for fighting back and that all three had been locked in an “ice-cold room” with their feet bound by a rope suspended from the ceiling."
11863,injustice,"he wants to capitalize on the event and to use it to mobilize people, rushing to dr. copeland’s house and asking a startled and uncomprehending willie to go on a tour with him so he can tell his story and thus agitate and educate the masses about the injustice of the system."
11864,inside,"throughout the years of carson mccullers’s childhood and adolescence, dr. mady copeland, his daughter, portia, her brothers and husband and the whole african american community around them were growing inside her."
11865,injustice,"like mark twain, she had her first encounter with racial injustice during childhood, when her maid lucille, “who was one of the kindest and youngest of our nurses, she was only fourteen and a marvelous cook,” worked late one night and called a cab to go home."
11866,injustice,"carson and her brother watched as lucille left and the cabdriver refused to drive her, yelling, “i’m not driving no damn nigger.” seeing “lucille’s embarrassment, and the feeling of ugliness of the whole injustice” made her brother run under the house, weeping, but carson, “torn with fury,” screamed to the driver, “you bad, bad man.” then, she recalled, “i went to join my brother, and we held hands in order to comfort ourselves, because there was nothing, nothing else we could do.” decades later, not long before her death, she would write, “we were exposed so much to the sight of humiliation and brutality, not physical brutality, but the brutal humiliation of human dignity which is even worse."
11867,court,"for him it is a matter of “the strong, true purpose, the will to justice.” he goes to court and asks to see the judge."
11868,jail,"the deputy sheriff and two other white men make fun of him, and when he insists, he’s taken in and booked and beaten with clubs, but “a glorious strength was in him and he heard himself laughing aloud as he fought.” he was kept in jail overnight, his fever came back and the next morning he was freed."
11869,injustice,before injustice i held my peace.
11870,county,"he later tells jake, “the most fatal thing a man can do is try to stand alone.” despite his fury, his solution is “to lead more than one thousand negroes in this county on a march."
11871,death,"years later, close to her death in 1967, mccullers was reminded that she had anticipated the 1963 march on washington—another instance, as nabokov would put it, of life imitating art."
11872,war,"we were all in the movement against the war in vietnam together, and “the other mike” was a vietnam  veteran."
11873,where,"he seldom talked in any of our numerous meetings, formal or informal, where almost everyone had something to say and few were too shy to interrupt and make themselves heard."
11874,war,"i couldn’t get it out of my head, and afterwards, all those times we were arguing, planning protests and denouncing the war atrocities, i wondered in the back of my mind, what is mike thinking?"
11875,death,"and i just heard that he has died and already been cremated.” this was followed by a few comments about this “town character,” mike wright, and the confirmation of his death."
11876,death,"it was only after his death that i discovered mike’s website, in michael’s opinion, and began to read his posts."
11877,freedom,"in michael’s opinion offers up gossip and “facts”: boren and tenet were “reported by time to be having a ‘leisurely breakfast’ together in a washington hotel on the morning of the 9/11 attack.” in the ceremony in which george w. bush presents tenet with the presidential medal of freedom, bush “talks about the fact that tenet was always seen around the cia with an unlit cigar in his mouth.” mike asks us to note “the knowing smile from general tommy franks” in the video and the fact that boren, sitting in the audience, is seen “rubbing his hand over another man’s back and resting it on his shoulder.” there was no way i could fully understand his treatises on aids, the cia or 9/11."
11878,where,no one really wants to know or cares where he comes from.
11879,where,a lone turk who had roamed into the town years ago and who languished with his family behind the little store where they sold linens claimed passionately to his wife that the mute was turkish.
11880,county,one old man from the country said that the mute had come from somewhere near his home and that the mute’s father had the finest tobacco crop in all the county.
11881,where,"one day, singer, who on a much anticipated surprise visit to his friend discovers that antonapoulos is dead, returns to town, leaves his luggage in the middle of the train station, goes straight to the jewelry shop where he works and comes out with something heavy in his pocket; we are told that for a while he “rambled with bent head along the streets.” but the narrator adds that “the unrefracted brilliance of the sun, the humid heat, oppressed him."
11882,where,"and then, when the snow melts, as carson’s french editor andré bay would ask, where does the whiteness go?"
11883,prisoner,"when all the rest of us grew up and got on with our adult lives, he “preferred not to.” the movement he had fought for had long since vanished, but not his cause—that had stayed with him, only at some point the “enemy” he so hated had come to take over his life, and he became a prisoner of his own worst imaginings."
11884,where,"on the internet, where our residues have a way of remaining, mike’s website still exists, forlorn and orphaned."
11885,where,"mike’s answer to it was: i’m proud to be a hippie here in norman, a place where long-haired fellers have a ball, i still wear old jeans and ragged t-shirts, ’cause i like living free and standing tall."
11886,where,i found a few videos on youtube called “ghostofmikewright” where cartoon characters discuss some of the issues mike wrote and talked about.
11887,death,"apparently the videos, one of which portrays a debate between boren and mike, were inspired after his death."
11888,court,he reminded me that mike had been the one who had warned him that the governor of oklahoma had mounted a court case against him and five other students for interrupting an rotc drill to protest the vietnam war.
11889,charges,"the judge hearing the case had dismissed the trumped-up charges, noting the lack of evidence and commenting that in any case there was more violence at your average campus football game than at the  demonstration in question."
11890,charges,"of all our many friends, mike had been the only one to take the trouble to try to find our address in tehran so that he could warn him about the charges."
11891,death,"people who wrote about mike after his death—friends, family and strangers—all mentioned his kindness and consideration, even if some, like that former ou student, dismissed his radical ideas."
11892,power,"i had known many in the movement who had joined because they were lonely and wanted companionship, or because they enjoyed power or felt safer belonging to a group, and also some who were there because they believed in the cause."
11893,question,"19 “what good was it?” this is a question mick kelly asks herself as she gets off work, that stays with her at the new york café while she waits for her chocolate sundae and a nickel glass of draft beer."
11894,inside,"mick used to have her dream, her music, her free hours to roam the streets, her inside and outside rooms, and she also had mr. singer to confide in."
11895,taken,but now this hope and secret pleasure have been taken away from her.
11896,guilt,"she has had her first sexual experience, accompanied by her first sense of guilt and shame, a secret different from her passion for music."
11897,death,"she has grown up all right, and how better to prove it than by the fact that, although she was the one who had found singer dead, she had gone to work as usual: she was no longer considered a child who had to be protected, for whom the secrets of life and death were to remain secret."
11898,locked,it seemed as if “the inside room was locked somewhere away from her.” mick’s despair is echoed by singer’s other disciples: the time has come for each of them to grow up and face the world.
11899,death,"after singer’s death, dr. copeland’s disease weakens his body and soul to the point that he can no longer practice or keep up the fight."
11900,law,"his children want him to live with his father-in-law, but he does not want to leave his dark and empty home."
11901,murder,"nor understanding.” where jake works, meanwhile, there is a murder: a young black boy is killed, and jake  takes off running through the streets."
11902,police,"he is knocked out, only to open his eyes and find out that he “lay half on and half beside the body of a young negro boy.” the boy is dead, the police are coming and jake starts to run."
11903,death,"it seems to jake that with singer’s death, all of the innermost thoughts he had confided in him have also died."
11904,death,singer’s death marks the end of childhood for mick—the only real adolescent in the story—but it signals a period of transformation for the three adults as well.
11905,death,"it takes immense pain and disillusionment, and a death, to awaken them into consciousness and to rescue them from the acts of violence that loneliness and despair can induce."
11906,death,"singer’s death has in a sense liberated them, forcing them to face reality both on the surface and in their inner lives."
11907,establishment,"with “the first establishment of identity there comes the imperative need to lose this new-found sense of separateness and to belong to something larger and more powerful than the weak, lonely self.” we leave adolescence behind when we allow ourselves to change by connecting with others."
11908,death,"after singer’s death, every one of the principal characters is shocked and griefstricken."
11909,death,"singer’s death is liberating to each of the characters who have grown to depend on him, because it forces them to confront their true selves, to see their yearnings unfiltered and raw."
11910,death,it is only with singer’s death that we discover that the others all have something to live for.
11911,death,"until singer’s death, biff, mick, jake and dr. copeland are not only childlike; they are childish."
11912,wall,"if it is not filled, this void or inner anguish can lead to violence—a violence that we find manifested in the novel when jake beats his head against the wall or dr. copeland beats the wife he loves."
11913,building,my own son was in a locked-down building adjacent to the one in which the virginia tech killer was massacring his classmates.
11914,cell,"he lost a professor, and for all those hours i spent calling his cell phone, trying vainly to contact him, i kept thinking that our children had survived a revolution and a war—but would my son survive the violence unleashed by this lonely and disturbed outcast in a small, peaceful american town?"
11915,death,it is only after his death that they become conscious of themselves and their surroundings.
11916,justice,"mick and her family will not become stars of a reality show, jake will not move the masses to demand social justice on youtube."
11917,building,"but there is that glimmer of hope in the fact that, now singer is dead, they will have to do more than merely talk—they can no longer lash out in episodic violence as they take refuge in reflection, in building a rudimentary plan."
11918,law,"the last we see of copeland, he is seated in a wagon beside his father-in-law, heading out to the country."
11919,where,where will he go this time?
11920,freedom,he did not long for open space and freedom—just the reverse.” only then does jake think of dr. copeland and of a visit he made to copeland’s house when the doctor was very sick and could not leave his bed.
11921,where,"he had made his way to the sick man’s room, where he found dr. copeland lying in bed with a high fever, and right away he started in on a long and arduous argument."
11922,charge,one by one the characters take charge of their lives and grapple more honestly with themselves.
11923,inside,else what the hell good had it all been—the way she felt about music and the plans she had made in the inside room?
11924,inside,"and when at last he was inside again he composed himself soberly to await the morning sun.”  21  the story ends, and no matter how many years go by, it will remain the same: we continue to wait with biff for the rising sun as a new generation of readers discovers these characters and gives them a new life."
11925,war,"the realities of our lives have changed a great deal since the publication of the heart is a lonely hunter in 1940, on the eve of america’s involvement in a war not of its own making—its last “good” war, followed by korea, vietnam, grenada, nicaragua, kuwait, afghanistan and iraq."
11926,liberty,"and yet the poverty and inequality that jake railed against, the savage daily threats to individual integrity and liberty, still exist and are justified in far more sophisticated ways."
11927,war,"in the twenties and thirties, right until it entered the second world war, america was undergoing a process of questioning and self-questioning, wondering how to define itself and relate to the rest of the world."
11928,where,"baltimore’s festival had a feel of the mass gatherings of the sixties and seventies, where people doing their own thing were tuned in to one another and appeared to be conspicuously enjoying themselves, a conspiracy of smiles that seemed to be a sort of protest against the harsh reality of the city."
11929,state,"it wasn’t that they were necessary, but i liked them, having come across them the day before while thinking of what i had taken to calling “my baldwin chapter,” though my editor would only say, “let’s see.” i strolled in a state of mind i would define as “alert absentmindedness,” taking in the sights and sounds while busily weaving ideas into words."
11930,charge,"you believe you are in control, but a serious give-and-take is really in operation, and in some mysterious way they are equally in charge of you, dragging you to new places, bringing strangers into your house and questioning your ways and habits."
11931,pen,"in the metro, in the middle of a conversation, even while watching a film, i would take out my pen and paper and jot down notes, some of which i could not decipher when i turned to them later at home."
11932,state,"writers are truth tellers, and that can sometimes put them in conflict with the state."
11933,state,"the american writer does so with a special mandate, twain suggests, because in a democratic society, far more so than in a monarchical or totalitarian one, the writer speaks for the individual and not for the state."
11934,poverty,"time and again in his essays, talks and interviews, he tried to describe what it meant to live as the grandson of a slave, born illegitimate and living in dire poverty."
11935,killing,"it comes as a great shock to discover that gary cooper killing off the indians, when you were rooting for gary cooper, that the indians were you."
11936,suspect,"i think all theories are suspect, that the finest principles may have to be modified, or may even be pulverized by the demands of life, and that one must find, therefore, one’s own moral center and move through the world hoping that this center will guide one aright."
11937,state,and yet i suggest he would be as anxious now as he was then about the state of his country.
11938,term,"a little farther, lo and behold, there was the h. l. mencken society, a tribute to the brilliant, grouchy inventor of the term “booboisie,” a very famous critic in the first few decades of the last century whom few people read today."
11939,death,"baldwin was born fourteen years after mark twain’s death, and yet despite their different backgrounds ( just being black and white was enough to create a chasm between them), they had both in their own ways experienced the worst that human beings can do to one another."
11940,guilt,it is too disgusting.” but that is exactly what james baldwin did: he laid bare his private soul and did not shy away from the shame and the guilt.
11941,abuse,"perhaps most crucially of all, he discovered james baldwin, and rescued him from the clutches of racism, poverty and abuse to rewrite his life story all over again."
11942,taken,"for much of his life he was an outsider even to himself: in one interview he spoke of “all those strangers called jimmy baldwin.” other writers have left america to find themselves and their worldview—henry james, edith wharton, gertrude stein, and later hemingway, fitzgerald, bowles and richard wright, who was at one time his mentor, having taken him under his wing."
11943,death,"worth was the model for rufus, who, in another country, commits suicide in the same manner and whose death is the central event that links the other characters and becomes a source of revelation for them."
11944,dungeon,"without this effort, the secret place was merely a dungeon in which the person perished; without this effort, indeed, the entire world would be an uninhabitable darkness.” baldwin went to paris to cleanse himself of his secrets, and to learn to write not out of rage but for the ages."
11945,civil rights,"all artists, if they are to survive, are forced, at last, to tell the whole story, to vomit the anguish up.” his  participation in the civil rights movement, his sympathy for the algerians’ suffering in france, were acts of witnessing, but it was only in his writing—his fiction and his essays—that he became the true witness."
11946,term,"these students were instinctively expressing a point some teachers and academic theoreticians have altogether missed; namely, that literature is in essence an investigation of the “other,” a term used in such a stale and rigid manner, it has lost its original meaning and is no longer about actual difference so much as identifying subcultures and ethnicities and placing people within increasingly confining categories."
11947,question,shouldn’t the point of books be not to affirm our views and prejudices but to question and confront them?
11948,state,"in the course of one day, holden, who a few days before christmas has been expelled from his posh prep school in pennsylvania but does not want to go home to new york before the holidays, lest his parents find out, checks into a hotel in another part of the city and moves from place to place searching for some way to appease and nourish his vague dissatisfaction with the state of things, complaining about his conformist school, where he is  “surrounded by phonies;” his encounter with girls who are dumb and have nothing intelligent to say; his lousy sex life or absence thereof; his older brother, a sellout to hollywood; the prostitute he meets over the course of his wanderings, with whom he is unable to have sex and who, although he pays her, returns with her pimp and forces more money out of him; and the overall mess that he believes has become his life."
11949,where,"what i have to do, i have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff—i mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going i have to come out from somewhere and catch them."
11950,where,"“go back to where you started,” james baldwin advised his nephew, “or as far back as you can, examine all of it, travel your road again and tell the truth about it."
11951,case,"in john’s case, he is the only character in the book who is a child born of love."
11952,incarceration,"his parents have eloped to new york city, where his father, richard, would commit suicide after a brutal and humiliating incarceration on a trumped-up charge."
11953,authority,"i justified this desire by the fact that i was still in school, and i began, fatally, with dostoyevsky.” go tell it on the mountain is a meditation on john grimes’s “crumbling of faith” and all the forces of authority that have held him back, that have kept him in darkness: racism, religious fanaticism, blind faith."
11954,state,"anyone who has lived like i did for eighteen years under fundamentalist rule, or in a secular totalitarian state like the soviet union, can testify to the truth of a statement he made in an interview with the village voice late in life: that “terror of the flesh ."
11955,death,"is a doctrine which has led to untold horrors.” when i reread go tell it on the mountain after almost thirty years, i was surprised by how much i had missed: its cadences that capture the rhythms of negro spirituals, moving with such physical and emotional force, its light and dark imagery and its theme of death and rebirth."
11956,authority,"what could be closer to the cherished ideal of american individualism than to stand up to obstacles regardless of the consequences, to say no to stifling authority and face the darkness with no safety net, mastering one’s fear?"
11957,crime,"“it is the innocence which constitutes the crime.” innocence protects us from knowledge, but knowledge leads to the truth."
11958,freedom,is not the desire to be free different from choosing freedom?
11959,freedom,"eric, the protagonist in baldwin’s third novel, another country, can embrace freedom because he “did not believe in the vast, gray sleep which was called security ."
11960,freedom,"as he went along.” americans think of themselves as champions of freedom, but that does not mean that, at a deep personal level, they are ready to be free."
11961,freedom,"he then added, “freedom is hard to bear."
11962,state,"it can be objected that i am speaking of political freedom in spiritual terms, but the political institutions of any nation are always menaced and are ultimately controlled by the spiritual state of that nation."
11963,freedom,"we are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know, and the american dream has therefore become something much more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels.” all writers must take risks; all must tread into the void and darkness; all do so passionately, embracing the agony of freedom and the unknown—that is the price of the ticket, as baldwin  would have said."
11964,gate,"“i have not written about being a negro at such length because i expect that to be my only subject,” he wrote in 1958, “but only because it was the gate i had to unlock before i could hope to write about anything else.” he had no fear of being thrown out of one paradise after another."
11965,freedom,he was not about to compromise his freedom as a writer in order to market his book.
11966,death,"“i haven’t thought much about my own, not enough anyway; i hazard that the king james bible, the rhetoric of the store-front church, something ironic and violent and perpetually understated in negro speech—and something of dickens’ love for bravura—have something to do with me today; but i wouldn’t stake my life on it.” on another occasion he said, “what the writer is always trying to do is utilize the particular in order to reveal something much larger and heavier than any particular can be.” baldwin called the simplification of complex issues—this categorization of human beings by race, gender, religion and ethnicity—“the death of the paradox.” as long as we each remain in our separate categories and are outraged only when something is said about us, as long as we read only about ourselves and go around only with other people like us, we will never grow or learn."
11967,civil rights,"he retained this independence all through the course of his involvement in the civil rights movement, taking sides with martin luther king jr. while appreciating and admiring malcolm x and always remaining wary of elijah muhammad."
11968,freedom,"art would not be important if life were not important, and life is important.” when, in 1937, zora neale hurston published their eyes were watching god, the story of a young black woman’s search for freedom, she was reproached by many prominent black intellectuals and writers, such as ralph ellison and richard wright, for having written a novel that was not about race."
11969,slavery,their eyes were watching god is in fact about freedom on several levels: freedom from slavery is the first step that leads to other forms of freedom—individual freedom and the freedom to control your own body and mind.
11970,injustice,"because that notion was preposterously new and threatening and insufficiently political for men who wanted more pointed considerations of injustice, it was scoffed at."
11971,murder,"he got away, but it made him reflect not simply on the fact that he could have been murdered for what he had done but on how he himself, in that instant, had been ready to commit murder."
11972,prisoner,he was afraid of being a prisoner forever despite the illusion that he was fighting for freedom.
11973,taken,"“negroes are americans and their destiny is the country’s destiny,” baldwin said in “many thousands gone,” and in so saying he had taken the first step toward being in control of his own destiny."
11974,where,"in his essay “why i stopped hating shakespeare,” he explains how at first he was “dubious about othello” and “bitter about caliban,” just as “some jews bitterly and mistakenly resent shylock.” he attributed this to being a victim of “that loveless education which causes so many schoolboys to detest shakespeare.” he rediscovered  shakespeare when he read him again in france, where he came to peace with the english language, having earlier rejected it because he felt it reflected none of his experience."
11975,where,in france he came to see that the “greatest poet in the english language found his poetry where poetry is found: in the lives of the people.
11976,dungeon,"one of them said, ‘the very time i thought i was lost, my dungeon shook and my chains fell off.’ ."
11977,freedom,"you know, and i know, that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon.” when his friend william styron decided that he wanted to write about nat turner, the rebel slave leader, baldwin celebrated his courage and applauded the desire to get under his skin, however flawed the attempt might be."
11978,power,"the failure of the protest novel lies in its rejection of life, the human being, the denial of his beauty, dread, power, in its insistence that it is his categorization alone which is real and which cannot be transcended.” ideology eliminates paradox and seeks to destroy contradiction and ambiguity."
11979,question,this is true whether the ideology in question is of the right or of the left.
11980,question,"and even if we dislike the ideology in question, our reaction to it is also sort of comforting, for we already know what they will say and how we will respond."
11981,racism,"the article, entitled “warning: the literary canon could make students squirm,” begins by asking, “should students about to read ‘the great gatsby’ be forewarned about ‘a variety of scenes that reference gory, abusive and misogynistic violence,’ as one rutgers student proposed?” it goes on to ask whether huckleberry finn and things fall apart should come with a “note of caution” because they address racism."
11982,sexism,"be aware of racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, and other issues of privilege and oppression."
11983,charge,perhaps those at oberlin and other universities who have caved in to this nonsense should take another look at the world and this country before redefining “privilege” and “oppression”—or simply take another look at how much they charge students to enroll in their institutions.
11984,question,"to find this nonsense at universities—whose basis for existence is a mandate to encourage us to question, to think, to imagine and of course to learn."
11985,freedom,"i don’t believe that baldwin in his wildest dreams could ever have imagined that the descendants of those people, black and white, with whom he had marched for freedom under the threat of guns, who had braved shackles and chains and prison to fight segregation, would be scared of reading about their own history."
11986,captivity,"what will we say to the young girl in iran who is arrested and flogged for going to a party, or to the mother in nigeria whose daughter has been kidnapped by terrorists and sold into slavery, or to the young girls abducted, raped and kept in captivity for years right here in the united states?"
11987,power,"it was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive.” one can and should have sympathy with victims of trauma, and society should do everything in its power to help them heal, but dealing with trauma is a serious matter, and not every place can become a trauma center."
11988,where,how will young people fend for themselves in a world where the big bad wolf comes in so many guises?
11989,power,"but there was no getting there without pain: “if one can live with one’s own pain, then one respects the pain of others, and so, briefly, but transcendentally, we can release each other from pain.” time and again, i have wondered if our current assault on literature, which so many like to think of as useless and irrelevant, is not a reflection of the desire to remove from the equation anything that is painful or distasteful to us, anything that does not fit our norms or make life easy and fall within our sphere of power and control."
11990,captive,"we are constantly reaching out for aspirin for our souls—happy pills, similar to what the great polish poet czeslaw milosz mentions in the captive mind."
11991,state,"citing a dystopian novel by another polish writer, stanislaw ignacy witkiewicz, milosz describes a decadent society somewhere in europe that is cleverly invaded by an all-powerful sino mongolian army by spreading into the market murti-bing pills, which transform individuals into a state of serene indifference, “impervious to any metaphysical concerns,” such as art, which appeases their “spiritual hunger.” such things become “outmoded stupidities” for them."
11992,war,"for eighteen years i experienced a revolution, a war, murder and the persecution of people close to me."
11993,camp,"we read primo levi’s memories of a concentration camp, anna akhmatova and osip mandelstam, whose poetry chronicles the darkest hours of the soviet union, frederick douglass and toni morrison, sylvia plath and philip roth, and we read about ordinary people who showed extraordinary courage in the face of unimaginable pain."
11994,war,"as henry james put it, the best way to resist the horror of war is to “feel for all you’re worth, and even if it half kills you, for that is the only way to live.” america’s elite are worried that the country is falling behind china in mathematics, but they should start worrying that it is falling behind in a more fundamental way, in something that was always considered america’s strength: namely, the ability to stand up to any challenge, no matter how difficult or daunting."
11995,racism,"if colleges were genuinely interested in fighting “oppression and privilege,” they would not only teach children the great works of fiction, they would make them aware that a real and serious fight against racism and oppression is being fought in impoverished neighborhoods all around the country."
11996,civil rights,"they would encourage their students to get to know the facts of life, beginning with a simple one: according to ucla’s civil rights project, the number of “doubly segregated” schools has grown in the last twenty-five years."
11997,where,where did we go wrong?
11998,freedom,is this what we were fighting for when we came into the streets and demanded freedom?
11999,question,so i didn’t dismiss her question.
12000,where,"it is funny how writers, no matter where they come from or from what age or era, all acknowledge the darkness before the light, the risks and rewards of fiction and of life."
12001,hole,i felt a bit like alice when she first saw the white rabbit and started to run after him and jumped down that hole.
12002,law,"i also want to acknowledge other members of farah’s circle: her sisters-in-law roshanak semnani and niloofar ziaie ebrahimi; jaleh behroozi, her friend, mate and comrade; habib lajevardi, her beloved second husband and gholam reza afkhami, her good friend and brother-in-law."
12003,justice,"although this book ultimately could not do justice to that theme, conversations with rose and my reading of styron helped shape my thoughts on baldwin, and i hope to return to this obsession later."
12004,court,"i would also like to thank clare ferraro, my publisher, and others at viking and penguin for their enthusiasm and their creative ways of helping this book come into the world: paul slovak, kathryn court, nancy sheppard, carolyn coleburn, lindsay prevette (my ever vigilant and thoughtful publicist), kristin matzen, the ever creative and supportive winnie de moya, elda rotor, fred huber and alan walker."
12005,civil rights,"during the course of writing this book, i have benefited a great deal from a number of pbs programs, especially american masters, pbs newshour’s reports on education and its series with jeffrey brown and former poet laureate natasha trethewey on the role of poetry in schools, and many fine documentaries on the civil rights movement and other aspects of american history."
12006,state,"i started with the chronicle of higher education and the insightful essays in declining by degrees: higher education at risk, edited by richard h. hersh and john merrow, and i read widely on the state of public schools and education in general."
12007,building,"the underlying concept for this book was first articulated in a lecture at the rome international literary festival in 2004, published in the festival catalog as “loitering with intent: the subversive power of literature.” a slightly different and more condensed version of this talk appeared in the book world section of the december 5, 2004, washington post, entitled “the republic of the imagination,” and i have been building on this concept ever since."
12008,war,"i am also indebted to horace m. kallen, culture and democracy in the united states of america (with thanks to leon wieseltier); david mccullough, the greater journey: americans in paris; ronald c. white jr., a. lincoln: a biography; drew gilpin faust, this republic of suffering: death and the american civil war; and james mcpherson, battle cry of freedom."
12009,state,this book was made possible thanks to a grant from new york state council on the arts with the support of governor andrew cuomo and the new york state legislature.
12010,case,"no part of this book may be reproduced, used, or stored in any information retrieval system or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise, without prior written permission from the feminist press at the city university of new york, except in the case of brief quotations embodied in critical articles and reviews."
12011,war,"the centrality of politics in everyday life, and changes wrought by revolution, war, and religiously imposed segregation are reflected in these stories."
12012,freedom,"the unifying thread linking the stories is the struggle for freedom, self-assertion, and subjectivity in a confined social environment."
12013,power,they address the realities of their society with their voice to deconstruct the dominant power and to challenge notions about gender politics.
12014,freedom,they want individual freedom and a less intrusive political space.
12015,justice,"one salient feature of the revolution was the widespread participation of women fighting for social justice, human rights, and political freedom."
12016,camp,"the secular opposition was outmaneuvered and marginalized, and a hardline islamist camp ascended."
12017,state,most aspects of women’s lives became subject to state intervention.
12018,war,"the large scale contribution of women to overthrowing the old regime, participating in the iran-iraq war of the 1980s, and assuming an active role in civil society laid the groundwork for women to push the gender boundaries of islamism in favor of women’s rights and feminism.1 the postrevolutionary period also brought the flourishing of literature written by women as a powerful medium of artistic expression, giving them an empowered public voice."
12019,jail,"their confinement comes in the form of jail cells, their homes, and even clothing they must wear in public."
12020,authority,"they mistrust all authority, including parental authority."
12021,authoritarianism,"using allegorical gestures and magical realism, the narrative reveals what is hidden—the horror and violence citizens face in speaking up and for resisting authoritarianism."
12022,death,"the story is an elegy to the death of freedom, and to the memory of those taken away."
12023,where,"the magic grows out of the painful reality, and the flight of fancy lands on an unstable shore that pulls the dead and living into the depth of the sea, where only there are the silenced and drowned free to speak up and cry out for freedom."
12024,where,"drawing a parallel between a dog and her puppy and a woman and her sick child, the narrative style and complexity of the story resists a simple answer to how the characters have come to where they are and what their fates will be."
12025,where,"instead it acknowledges the contingent world they live in, where nothing can be taken for granted."
12026,death,sofia mahmudi goes further with textual experimentation in “grammar.” the protagonist wryly ponders his life and his death posthumously as a study in grammar.
12027,imprisoned,"in “the burnt sound,” by behnaz alipour gaskari, a young schoolgirl is imprisoned in solitary confinement for spray-painting political graffiti."
12028,wall,she clings to every sound that comes through her prison wall.
12029,cell,the heartfelt songs she hears from a garage next to the prison inhabit her cell and become her constant companion.
12030,escaped,has he finally tragically escaped from his own prison in the process?
12031,war,"it is set during the iran-iraq war at the time of air raids, when iraqi bombs were dropping all over iranian cities and neighborhoods."
12032,war,the violence of war becomes a reality in flesh and blood that defines the violated body.
12033,abuse,"in zohreh hakimi’s story, “the wandering cumulus cloud,” a married daughter who is subjected to domestic abuse pushes back against the dominant tradition of the paternalistic laws, asking for divorce and seeking to expose the oppressive gender order."
12034,flagellation,"the ageold pageantry, sacrificial slaughter of animals, and self-flagellation of the ceremony mingle with the protagonist’s memories of a lost love and her reflection on her marriage and children."
12035,conviction,"in reality it is a potent tool of persuasion, of conviction, and of political hegemony."
12036,police,"as the protagonist muses, the dead “seem to be with us for ever and ever.” “a bloody day of ashura,” by masih alinejad, captures the frenzy and anxiety of a political demonstration that ends in violent confrontation with the security police."
12037,state,"a group of activists joins a protest march, mindful of state violence and security police."
12038,police,"when a member of the militia on the side of the security police is injured in the process of trying to provoke the crowd to violence, a member of the group steps forward to protect him and quells the growing violence of the crowd."
12039,stretch,"in one place, on the checkered blanket, and only its claws stretch out and reach the edge of the blanket, the blanket that will surely get muddied or stained with a mix of blood and mud if golestani is not tied to something, to a tree, for instance."
12040,death,"it seemed everything was still continuing, all the things that had started six months after grandmother’s death."
12041,where,"the dead only slept in their own graves on friday nights, and during the week they were in the sea, in the depths of green waters, someplace where they could have open discussions without fear and foreboding and speak their minds and shout as much as they wanted."
12042,state,in what state could she be at this moment?
12043,question,"golestani, if it isn’t too much trouble, we have a simple question,’ and they took him away.” she had heard this from mrs. golestani late one night after the incident when she had gone to golestani’s house."
12044,wall,"for instance, she could describe them as having their hands in their pockets, with their collars turned up against the chill and the cold winds of february, leaning against the wall, waiting."
12045,taken,"mr. golestani didn’t like apples, otherwise the young man could have picked up one of the apples rolling on the floor and taken a bite."
12046,where,"and then someone screamed, a woman who didn’t know where she was, who she was, or what she was doing, and then there was the rented pickup truck and mr. golestani whose head wobbled on the woman’s lap and the rough and uneven road that seemed to have been intentionally littered with rocks so that no one could reach the cemetery easily ."
12047,taken,"mrs. golestani said, “i wouldn’t have taken him there even if it was open."
12048,question,"you have the indifference and dispassion of history writers.” regardless of anything mr. golestani said, a writer has to pursue everything, everything from the beginning, when someone comes and says, “if it isn’t too much trouble, just a simple question ."
12049,question,.” and now the sea was full of dead people who went away with this same simple question and their feet never touched dry land again.
12050,where,"from where she was sitting, she saw the gravedigger take a five hundred-tuman bill from one of the women accompanying mrs. golestani and then he sat at golestani’s feet and yanked the shoes off his feet and untied the shoelaces with his teeth."
12051,pen,"“grave ready, adidas shoes,” she tried to write these words on the top margin of the page, above the word “monday.” the paper was wet, the pen was streaking, and the ink was discolored, as if it had remained unused for years."
12052,pen,"she picked up the pen to write, and she wrote, “the smell of mustiness, the smell of decay, and the flames of four candles reflecting on the cellar’s salt-stained walls and the shadows and light they created."
12053,pen,"half-open with his teeth exposed, as if he had wanted to laugh heartily but had swallowed his laughter, and mrs. golestani was a thin and pallid apparition.” when she looked at the page, she saw that it only bore the grooves made by the tip of the pen and that the wet paper was still white."
12054,power,history can only put someone on trial when the accused either no longer exists or has lost his power .
12055,escaped,"the logic of daily events escaped us, and history, like the onslaught of a foreign horde, swept away old customs and pillaged what was left with an assortment of unmatched pieces that did not fall into any recognizable patterns."
12056,taken,we thought he had been taken ill or— god forbid—had died in one of the clashes of the revolution.
12057,authorities,"zahra khanum, too shy and diffident for a face-to-face encounter, sent an emissary to let us know of the complaint she was filing against us with the authorities."
12058,inside,"nobody answered the door, although we could hear someone inside and see a pair of eyes watching us from behind a curtain in a window."
12059,power,"during the power outages at night, we sat around the oil lamp and held our breath in fear anytime there was a knock on the door."
12060,war,"parents, younger but unwilling to migrate and change their lifestyle, dreaded loneliness, revolution, and war."
12061,guard,"my physician uncle, surpassing all in wisdom, got himself a pair of grown german shepherds (which immediately proceeded to bite mother on the thigh and my aunt on the ankle), installed several alarms and an early warning system, and hired a security guard to watch him and the house."
12062,war,"i was planning to leave, and war was about to break out."
12063,law,it was the son-in-law who was in control of the mission.
12064,question,"from where she stood, she jutted her head and squealed in her high-pitched voice, “so why was there a revolution?” good question, we all thought."
12065,law,"the son-in-law, less mindful of us, blurted out a figure, which in his view was exorbitant."
12066,incarceration,"she steered the conversation to the inflationary spiral of prices, shortages of water and electricity, my brother’s run-in with the authorities and his recent incarceration, the theft of uncle doc’s car, and hassan agha’s traitorous defection."
12067,pleaded,"“dear girl,” pleaded mother apprehensively, “don’t move that antique vase, please."
12068,sink,"she then washed her face and wetted her hair in the sink, plumped down in the middle of the living room floor, and went out like a light."
12069,where,“where did this come from?” she exclaimed.
12070,where,"where did you get her, anyway?” mother was being obnoxious, of course, while i was trying to calm auntie down."
12071,death,"“i’d rather die a death of loneliness, wash floors, and clean house by myself than let a stranger into my life,” she announced."
12072,crime,“just the fact that you’re sitting here hale and hearty is itself a crime.
12073,crime,our crime is that we still have our heads on our shoulders.
12074,authority,do you understand?” there was so much authority in her voice that even i was transfixed.
12075,inside,without a word i picked up my books and newspaper and went inside.
12076,question,"mohammad agha said you have finished elementary school.” “i have a question,” said zeynab, changing the subject."
12077,sentence,"for all i know i may be a foundling.” as she turned toward us, mother heard the last sentence."
12078,where,"where did they get our phone number and address?” “they are after me,” zeynab said “all those thieves and smugglers.” if auntie malak had heard this, she would have fainted on the spot, i thought."
12079,gang,"turns out my husband was a heroin-smuggling gang leader, him and his mother and brothers."
12080,hanged,"a little later, i saw their pictures in the paper, and the report said that they’d hanged my husband and two of his brothers."
12081,where,then this woman who says she’s raised me took me to her house and that’s where i saw mohammad agha.
12082,taken,it suddenly occurred to mother that zeynab had taken a shower in the downstairs bathroom and had possibly seen the crates of wine bottles left with us by a friend for safekeeping.
12083,captive,"here we are, our maid’s captive!” “we’d better not talk about the crates,” i said dismissively."
12084,taken,we had cut down on socializing—which had taken a toll on mother’s temper.
12085,authorities,she was already demoralized by hassan agha’s departure and morteza’s grievance lodged with the authorities.
12086,where,how would it be possible to go into exile at her age to a land where streets evoked no memories and language was a barrier?
12087,war,"despite everything—the murderous afghani wetbacks, religious-police raids, runaway inflation, hassan agha’s desertion, war, bombardment, and insecurity—tehran was home, and every part of it interlaced with her life."
12088,death,"death itself had familiar rituals, and life in this town, with all its chaos and agony, had familiar and comforting patterns for mother and was latent with the expectation of better things to come."
12089,execution,“did you notice how casually she spoke of her husband’s execution?” noted mother.
12090,executed,"but when i see their pictures in the paper and read the caption they have been executed, i get sick."
12091,where,i know where i’ll go.” “where?” asked mother expectantly.
12092,authority,"“back to the engineer, mr. sham-akhtar,” replied zeynab with authority."
12093,guard,he would alert his dogs to stand guard before he opened the door.
12094,inside,"when we rang the doorbell, we could hear a siren sounding inside the house, setting off the dogs."
12095,question,"a metallic voice in the intercom asked, “who are you?” then another voice from behind the door asked the same question for confirmation."

12183,cell,i spread a blanket on the cell floor and placed the water jug and plastic cup next to it.
12184,cell,"i wondered if i would go insane, but i was relieved to feel that the ambient noise was becoming increasingly routine and easier to get used to as a natural component of the atmosphere of my existence, a lifeline letting me share in the lives of the people beyond the walls of my cell."

12525,wall,"the blind flute player was now sitting against a sooty wall next to a row of sad beggars, playing a soft romantic tune."
12526,where,she worked for us three days a week and he spent his one day a week off with her at her parents’ home where she still lived.
12527,where,"his letter said that he was leaving for england, where he had been accepted to a film school; could i see him before he left?"
12528,where,"cyrus and parviz were still in america, and pari was in turkey with taheri, where he was showing his carpets to merchants."
12529,where,"after that they would settle in abadan, where javad had his practice and was affiliated with the oil refinery’s hospital."
12530,where,"they would live in a modern apartment in a modern area, where many of the american employees of the hospital and oil refinery lived as well."
12531,where,"“where did you get this communistic book?” “i found it in an empty classroom,” i said, not wanting to give away the bookstore man."
12532,jail,"“your brothers never gave me trouble like you do.” his voice escalated as he said, “if i’m caught with that book in my home i’ll lose my license and be sent to jail."
12533,crime,"three years for owning that book.” like an interrogator investigating a crime, he asked, “what else have you been reading?” without waiting for an answer he began to pull out the pages from the book and tear them into pieces."
12534,where,i remained frozen in the same spot where i’d been when he appeared.
12535,serving,"the white revolution (“white” as opposed to the “black” revolution of the religious conservatives, or the “red” revolution of marxism) consisted of a package that included land reform, profit-sharing for industrial workers in privatesector enterprises, nationalization of forests and pastureland, sale of government factories to finance land reform, and establishment of a “literacy corps” made up of high school graduates sent to teach in villages instead of serving in the army."
12536,court,"his court was described as lavish and, worse, depraved."
12537,police,"they bitterly condemned the brutality of savak, which hadn’t changed since the white revolution, as well as the united states for helping the shah to form the police force and keep it going."
12538,arrest,"savak had become a law unto itself, having legal authority to arrest, detain, interrogate, and torture suspects."
12539,prisons,"savak operated its own prisons in tehran, the notorious evin prison among them."
12540,taken,he had taken a leading role in opposing the shah.
12541,prosecution,he also criticized the shah for giving immunity from prosecution to americans living in iran.
12542,prisoner,"if the men of religion had any influence, it would be impossible for the nation to be at one moment the prisoner of england, the next of america.” in 1963 khomeini issued a fatwa against the shah’s reforms."
12543,ordered,"he called the shah “yazid,” who, according to shiites, was a dissolute leader who had ordered the assassination of hussein."
12544,jail,it’s no better than a jail cell.” i was confused.
12545,power,i hated the shah’s tyranny and all the power he allowed the savak.
12546,freedom,"the same was true of my feelings about america—i didn’t like their having helped create the savak, but i yearned for the personal freedom i would be allowed in that country."
12547,law,"indeed, news of the new law had barely reached girls."
12548,transferred,"she had arrived in the middle of the year because her father, who worked at the educational ministry in isfahan, had been transferred to ahvaz."
12549,arrested,"she said that police had come to their house, searched all their books and every document and paper, and arrested her father."

12552,arrest,"they were zealous, desperate, risking arrest."
12553,where,she had been forced to resign and no one knew where she was.
12554,inside,"though the pane was broken, there was no way to see inside the store because thick cardboard covered the break."
12555,where,"i didn’t know his last name or where he lived, even though we had had so many conversations."
12556,arrested,then khomeini was arrested.
12557,imprisoned,"after being imprisoned for two months, he was put under house arrest in an isolated suburb of tehran."
12558,ordered,"after he ordered he said suddenly, “i’m going to let you go to college in america."
12559,situation,but my situation had changed so suddenly that i couldn’t quite trust it.
12560,transferred,“he works for a caviar export company and has been transferred there.
12561,jail,"hundreds of men and, to my surprise, some women, too, were shouting, “you can’t silence us forever.” “open the jail doors and free our sisters and brothers.” they looked angry, determined."
12562,power,"“americans have been exploiting us and giving the shah too much power, but still america has a lot to offer a young girl like you,” mr. boroojerdi said."
12563,wall,i leaned my head against the wall so that he wouldn’t see my tears.
12564,taken,i had been told that the photograph was taken just before my grandmother took me away.
12565,where,i was leaving this home and going where i deeply wished to be.
12566,wall,"then i spread the paradise tapestry, which i had brought without its frame, on the back of a chair until i could frame it and hang it on the wall."
12567,taken,the one english course i had taken in high school hadn’t prepared me adequately.
12568,freedom,my isolation felt like freedom at first.
12569,chapel,"beauty contests, mixers with boys the school invited from colleges in the area, sermons in the presbyterian chapel at which attendance was required no matter what your religion—all just floated around me without meaning."
12570,police,the police used to pull it off the heads of women who wore it outdoors.
12571,freedom,"now, here i was in this land of freedom and more or less forced to wear it."
12572,where,i went to the room where the reception was taking place.
12573,chapel,twenty i was feeling hot and stifled by the sermon in the chapel.
12574,chapel,"here in this college i felt a pressure to believe in christianity, and going to the chapel was compulsory."
12575,wall,"a clock on the wall chimed, interrupting us."
12576,where,"as i trudged through my days in a place where i didn’t fit in, i tried to focus on my future."
12577,where,"i would go somewhere in america where i could blend in more, though i had no idea yet where that was or how i would get there."
12578,freedom,writing in english gave me a freedom i didn’t feel writing in farsi.
12579,taken,"“they’re very provincial.” we reached her house at dinnertime, having taken an early bus from st. louis."
12580,question,“the most common dishes are fish and lamb and chicken kababs and stews.” “do you have houses in iran?” was shirley’s next question.
12581,inside,her mother was inside  talking to her.
12582,jail,"was he in jail, dead, alive?"
12583,arrest,he had been released from house arrest and sent into exile in turkey.
12584,where,"and you?” “nahid mehramy.” he repeated my name a couple of times and asked, “where are you from?” “iran.” “a modern shah and queen and all the oil,” he said."
12585,where,"not that i was afraid of being seen with the man, as i had been when i went for the boat ride with james, but because i was afraid of who bill owen might be, where he would take me."
12586,rape,in the dormitory students talked about rape and murder.
12587,locked,"before i got onto the boat with james, i had seen him around town, our eyes had locked, we had smiled at each other."
12588,gate,i stood by the school’s gate as if i had been thrown out of his car.
12589,taken,it had taken a long time to understand the cues of this new culture and to finally become a part of it.
12590,where,finally i put the letter in a cardboard box where i kept an antique tortoiseshell comb and brush set that pari had given to me when we were in ahvaz.
12591,inside,i was hoping i wouldn’t get pregnant but here i am with a baby growing inside me.
12592,wall,"with a frozen gaze like that of the dead you stare at the smoke drifting from a cigarette at a cup at a fading epigraph on the wall with stiff fingers you push aside the drapery on the window you stand there motionless and like a wind-up doll, you see the world with glass eyes  you watch the rain falling in the alley a child standing in a doorway, flying colorful kites at night in bed, enveloped in a man’s domineering arms you cry out with a voice that is false and remote, “i love ."
12593,freedom,".” you sleep for years in lace and tinsel, your body stuffed with straw rise up and seek your freedom, my sister why are you quiet?"
12594,state,"now from an even farther distance than that between ahvaz and tehran, i was haunted by pari’s state in life, in the hands of her despotic husband."
12595,freedom,she had hoped that in tehran she would find freedom.
12596,law,"pari couldn’t visit me because taheri would never allow her to come all the way to america; now that she was married, iranian law stipulated that he (rather than father) was the one from whom she needed a permission letter to travel."
12597,custody,once i was watching a tv program in the lounge about a mother who had spent several years trying to regain custody of the child she gave up for adoption.
12598,where,parviz found me a job for the summer as an assistant to a psychiatrist at the hospital in st. louis where he did his internship.
12599,state,parviz himself was leaving st. louis for another state to do his medical residency.
12600,case,"one afternoon, while i was waiting for a bus, a young man came over to me and asked, “are you a singer?” he was carrying a guitar case."
12601,ordered,he took me to a table and ordered me a beer before joining a group of musicians on the stage.
12602,freedom,"here i am, i thought, in the land of freedom, and yet i am so unfree in my own life."
12603,situation,"i wanted to have new experiences, to experiment, but alas, most of the time i felt as if i were in a precarious situation and had to be cautious."
12604,law,"shirin, azar’s sister, had worked as a secretary in a law office and had studied all the laws relevant to women; she believed they were unfair."
12605,jail,“did you know he was in jail for a year?
12606,sentenced,taheri was sentenced to ten years in prison.
12607,where,my cousin works in the lamp shop on the street where your husband ran over the woman.
12608,conviction,"please, please don’t tell your husband i told you all this.” pari thought about what a reckless driver taheri was, always full of freefloating anger and the conviction that he had the right of way."
12609,wall,when he wanted to emphasize a point he clenched his fist so tightly that his knuckles became white and then he would pick up a vase or a plate and throw it against the wall.
12610,jail,"then a thought came to her—if she found the evidence that taheri had been in jail and for what crime, maybe the information would enable her to get a divorce without losing custody of her son and the right to her mehrieh."
12611,guilt,"if there were any documents in the house, pointing to taheri’s guilt, they would be in the black filing cabinet in the basement that was always locked."
12612,wall,another day she had looked through the folders stored in the cabinets set against the wall.
12613,locked,one of the cabinets was locked.
12614,locked,in the morning shirin and her cousin ebrahim came over and pari led them to the locked cabinet.
12615,inside,after ebrahim opened the lock they found only two folders inside.
12616,sentence,"and there it was—a yellowish document drawn up by a lawyer, asking a judge to reduce the jail sentence."
12617,guilt,and he might have deep guilt locked inside him.
12618,court,"“wouldn’t the court grant me the divorce and let me keep bijan, and my mehrieh, too, if you show them this document?” father read the document carefully and said, “this doesn’t say anything about his running away from the scene, and he was let out of jail after a short time."
12619,law,"maybe he knows others who were there, too.” “i’ve been in law for years,” father said."
12620,killing,"that’s why so many americans are miserable, lonely, killing themselves with drugs and alcohol."
12621,court,the court will let taheri keep him because he’s two years old and doesn’t need your milk.
12622,law,that’s the law.
12623,situation,"“you want to be in the same situation as those poor, lonely women who aren’t able to find husbands?” mohtaram asked after a moment."
12624,taken,"“but i’ve been married already.” “you’ll be unmarried again if you pursue this kind of attitude.” taheri’s sisters informed him that pari had taken bijan and most likely gone home, so he cut his trip short and came directly to ahvaz."
12625,where,"father would concede only that taheri was “below our family in intellect and culture.” majid was married and living in isfahan, where he was teaching and working as an assistant director in a film studio."
12626,tortured,"but in her darker moods she tortured herself with images of majid and his wife sharing the same space, exchanging intimate words, touches."
12627,arrested,"strange, manijeh thought, since other people criticized shahla, saying that she had bad manners, that her family wasn’t reputable, that her father had once been arrested for smuggling drugs into the country from dubai."
12628,situation,added to the political situation in iran was my painful family situation.
12629,authority,the greyhound bus pulled into new york’s port authority terminal at six in the morning.
12630,authority,"groggy and disoriented, i sat in a restaurant in the port authority to have breakfast, trying to think, to pull my mind together."
12631,where,"i had made no advance plans about where to stay, and i didn’t have a job."
12632,where,“where’s your family?” “over there.” “mine are on that side.
12633,inside,a wound inside me opened up.
12634,confinement,many had come to the big city to escape the confinement of small towns or a history of family difficulties.
12635,where,"after a few weeks there, i began to feel that not letting father know where i was (which also meant i had no access to pari) was more unbearable than letting him know, so i tore out a sheet from a notebook and wrote him a brief letter, giving him my address and assuring him that i was in a good, safe place and would be pursuing my education."
12636,power,"i tried to tell myself that even if he came after me, he would have no power to force me back to iran, that i was living in a different country with different rules now."
12637,freedom,but her freedom from taheri came at the expense of her mehrieh and her son.
12638,power,"father had gone to tehran several times and tried to use his influence with a judge he knew from law school, to see if he could get his grandson to live with them but the judge said it wasn’t in his power to change the laws."
12639,crime,"father mentioned taheri’s crime but, as he originally suspected, too much time had passed, and they didn’t have evidence of what had really caused the woman’s death."
12640,inside,he kissed me quickly and i went inside.
12641,building,"after that we met whenever our schedules could be squeezed to match— five minutes in the lobby of the graduate school building, twenty minutes in the cafeteria, an hour in the evening in a restaurant near the school for something quick to eat."
12642,question,"i looked at the plates of roast beef, potato pancakes, and coleslaw and tried to think of an answer to the question."
12643,taken,god has taken an interest in me by allowing my path to cross with yours.
12644,death,i feel an urgency to be united with you and for us to be each other’s guardians until death.
12645,poverty,the amount of money spent on the celebration highlighted the monarchy’s extravagant existence while many people were living in poverty.
12646,where,"the shah hired teams of workers to get rid of thousands of poisonous snakes and scorpions that populated the desert where the tents were set up, to build decorative water fountains near the tents, new roads planted with acres of small pine trees."
12647,arrested,"as the celebrations were taking place, several students were arrested for writing anti-shah graffiti: “thief shah is stealing from the starving people,” they wrote."
12648,police,"“lavish at the expense of starving people,” read the headlines, or, “an insult to our culture to serve french food.” terrorists attacked a number of banks, assassinated police officials, and blew up cinemas."
12649,detained,"savak detained at least 1,500 suspects, but more sprouted up."
12650,where,i was sitting on a bench in a little park not far from where i worked.
12651,where,"i thought again and again of maryam, of her taking me to a mosque where she worshipped occasionally."
12652,taken,"i looked at her through the shiny veil of the drizzle and i thought i saw tears in her eyes as she said, “i pray to god every day that you won’t be taken away from me.” inside, the chamber was lit by the flames of hundreds of candles in candelabras."
12653,guilty,"when my husband’s mother became a part of our life, accepting our marriage because of our child, i felt guilty that maryam wasn’t the one sharing leila with us."
12654,ordered,he gave me the phone number of one in boston; i ordered chicken and lamb.
12655,where,"howie came in from our bedroom, where we had our desks, and greeted maryam."
12656,inside,it was hard to believe she was inside my apartment in cambridge.
12657,serving,i assured her that everything i was serving was halal.
12658,building,"so i started writing a novella about our neighbors in the building, with whom we shared a backyard."
12659,where,she went on trips to where she thought his business might take him.
12660,chain,"her hands were tied behind her with a chain, the end of which was held by a young girl i assumed was her niece."
12661,chain,i watched the girl tie the chain to a column on the porch and i moved away when sultaneh began to shriek as if she were being whipped.
12662,question,"someone who doesn’t speak your language, doesn’t understand where you come from?” i couldn’t think of a response, and although the conversation drifted to other topics, her pointed question stayed with me."
12663,freedom,"i had finally found freedom in america, but there was a hole inside me, a lack."
12664,state,"in the novel, foreigner, i tried to channel that state of mind— feeling foreign in both iran and america, into the female narrator."
12665,question,"she finds her, then begins to question her happiness in the united states."
12666,prisoners,"they sent out messages to people in iran and abroad through newsletters in which they talked about corruption in the royal family, reported on the torture and execution of thousands of political prisoners, the suppression of dissent, and heavy censorship of books, radio and tv programs, newspapers, and speech."
12667,jails,they displayed graphic photographs of men and women being tortured in iranian jails.
12668,prisoners,"they described the methods of torture—hanging prisoners, male or female, upside down, stuffing urine-soaked cloths into their mouths, making them walk on nails."
12669,torture,"the article reported arbitrary arrests, torture, and summary executions in iran."
12670,taken,"since it was impossible to identify all the iranians abroad who were actively opposed to the shah’s rule, any young iranian who went back to iran was taken into a room upon landing at the airport and questioned for hours."
12671,detained,"many of them were detained, their passports confiscated."
12672,jail,they were thrown in jail and some were executed.
12673,executed,i looked at the photographs of two people who had been executed.
12674,custody,i’m struggling to gain custody of bijan and that absorbs almost all of my attention.
12675,authorities,complaints to the authorities haven’t gotten anywhere yet.
12676,law,the 1967 family protection law that the shah introduced to improve women’s rights isn’t enforced.
12677,inside,it’s like i’m losing my sense of self inside a body i don’t recognize.
12678,prisoners,"that year, the shah released 357 political prisoners."
12679,jail,"amnesty international had reported that savak’s history of torture in jail was “beyond belief.” president jimmy carter told the shah that if he didn’t improve his human rights record, u.s. aid to iran, including military assistance, would be terminated."
12680,sentences,"the censorship authorities sent the translator a list of words and sentences to be deleted: words such as “red,” which symbolized communism, and “black night” and “high walls,” symbolizing repression and prison respectively."
12681,where,"i called the iranian consulate in new york, where we were living now, and an official confirmed that the shah was indeed guaranteeing safe return to iranians abroad."
12682,law,"he added ruefully, “needing a permission letter for a woman to travel is certainly an outdated law; parliament argued against it, but it’s still in place.” my husband thought it would be healthy for me to connect with my family, since he saw his own regularly now."
12683,suspects,"when we landed at mehrabad airport, the official at the passport-check booth scrutinized the photographs on our passports, looked at our faces, and then at the sheets of paper spread in front of him to make sure we weren’t on any lists of anti-government suspects."
12684,freedom,"as we headed to pari’s house, we passed the tower of freedom, a tall limestone arch that flared out at the sides."
12685,law,father tried to communicate with howie in french (french had been a required language when father attended law school in tehran and howie had studied it in high school).
12686,wall,an ornate turquoise minaret and the dome of a mosque rose beyond the courtyard wall.
12687,inside,"“i suppose it is.” inside it was almost a duplicate of her room at home in ahvaz, with posters of actors and actresses covering the walls."
12688,court,"even my lawyer, who is very good in his field, hasn’t been able to force taheri to come to court."
12689,law,father clearly wanted the visit to go smoothly and to show his foreign son-in-law what a good family he had married into.
12690,taken,"after an hour mansour left to go to work, from which he had taken time off in the morning."
12691,where,"father invited us to lunch at the restaurant of the tehran hilton hotel, where he and mohtaram were staying."
12692,ordered,"howie and i ordered lemon chicken and cherry rice, gormeh sabsi, and joojeh kabab."
12693,case,"like father, he had married a nine-year-old girl—in his case eighteen years younger than himself."
12694,where,"he regularly went to the zoor khaneh (house of strength), where men exercised ritualistically, with classical iranian music playing in the background."
12695,custody,"“i know she’s upset about her son, and the custody battle that has been going on for years."
12696,where,"“yes, and there’s so much i want to talk to you about, it’s hard to know where to start,” she said."
12697,sexism,she told me she was still struggling for personal and artistic identity in tehran with its fierce double standard and sexism.
12698,freedom,"but now she realized those were only superficial elements in the context of a larger lack of freedom for women, and men in certain areas."
12699,situation,"even though the government supported some official opportunities for women, the situation hadn’t improved much because of the prevailing paternalistic attitude."
12700,court,"the 1975 amendment to the family protection law gave women equal rights in divorce, custody of children, and marriage settlements, but these reforms weren’t actually put into practice; in court women almost always lost."
12701,law,"you’re equal in the eyes of the law but not, excuse my saying so, in ability."
12702,where,"pari and i left the house and walked to café miami, where she sometimes met with friends."
12703,ordered,we ordered two.
12704,inside,"i wish so much that she, and you of course, were a part of my life.”  the voice of a woman singing reached us from a radio inside the restaurant, mingling with the murmur of water flowing in the stream."
12705,murder,"it was years ago, but i still remember all the talk and speculation that it was self-inflicted or murder by the savak."
12706,custody,"and then there was her losing custody of her son.” “pari, i read that mrs. soleimani was killed in a car crash, too, that it was really not an accident but murder by the savak.” “yes, i heard that, and in her case there was evidence that someone ran into her car deliberately."
12707,murder,it wasn’t murder by the savak for a change; it was her own doing.” a sheen of sadness spread over pari’s face.
12708,courthouse,"it’s a kind of detachment, more than anything, now that i’m not dependent on her.” after we left the park we passed the civil courthouse."
12709,inside,"i wanted to tiptoe out and talk to pari, but just then she got up and went back inside."
12710,ordered,we continued to a bakery and sat at a table in a secluded corner and we ordered honeyglazed pastry and tea.
12711,taken,he must have taken the letter out of his pocket and absently put it there.
12712,guilt,he said he loved me and he wrote that to his wife out of guilt because she had found out he was seeing me.
12713,where,it fell into the  dark realm where my hope for being an actress is.
12714,inside,i could almost hear the bells of pain ringing loudly inside her and yet i didn’t know what words of comfort i could offer.
12715,insane,"i didn’t tell father and mother because of their attitude toward me, always thinking of me as a little insane because i left taheri."
12716,freedom,"but our relationship has been really strained ever since.” a faint smile appeared on her face as she said, “the irony is that, as much as i feared the hospital, i felt a certain sense of freedom there, too."
12717,building,we passed a sprawling building with a high wall around its courtyard.
12718,where,"“that’s where mansour took me,” pari said."
12719,wall,“pahlavi sanitarium for women” was written on a tile plaque on the wall next to the compound’s wrought-iron gate.
12720,gate,"when the gate swung open and a  guard let visitors out, i got a glimpse inside the courtyard."
12721,power,as a husband he had the power to commit his wife and no one would question him.
12722,death,"autopsy is against islamic law and the cause of his death remains a mystery to this day, but many people suspected savak of murdering him."
12723,torture,a group of lawyers had banded together to criticize savak torture and to monitor prison conditions.
12724,freedom,"dissident academics formed a group called the national organization of university teachers, and they joined students in demanding academic freedom."
12725,freedom,all the open criticism seemed to signify that the shah was giving people the freedom to express their views.
12726,where,"we have to put an end to nightclubs where foreign women in scanty clothes dance and where liquor flows like water.” a huge crowd, mostly men but some women, too, in chadors, had gathered around the platform."
12727,where,“western whores calling themselves dancers perform almost naked in nightclubs where alcohol is served freely like water.
12728,death,"“maybe it’s even worse now than when i lived in ahvaz.” on another street we came across a group of men wearing black clothes and holding black banners with slogans written on them in purple letters: “weed out evil,” “death to america,” “death to english.” they shouted, “we have suffered oppression for too long."
12729,courthouse,"“i heard in the courthouse that things are getting really bad for americans and english in iran,” father said."
12730,death,i remembered when i lived in ahvaz reading about a woman being stoned to death by her husband and his relatives in bandar abbas.
12731,penalty,the husband didn’t pay any penalty.
12732,state,"“the fact that a state-controlled tv station shows people’s dissatisfactions is a sign that things are getting out of hand,” mansour said."
12733,where,"after being expelled from iraq, khomeini went to paris, where he was more accessible to a large body of opposition forces."
12734,situation,khomeini’s father decided to do something about the situation and he went to arak to ask the provincial governor for help.
12735,murder,"did the murder of his father create in him a spirit of revenge against its supposed instigators, the authorities?"

12844,building,surprisingly manijeh had moved into the second floor of mohtaram’s building.
12845,justice,"images from the past of mohtaram’s love for manijeh kept coming to me: mohtaram putting her arm around manijeh and saying, “isn’t she an angel?” mohtaram putting a flower in manijeh’s hair and saying, “she’s like a flower herself.” it is poetic justice, in some small way, that manijeh is now mohtaram’s caretaker."

12853,power,"after her father’s death, the author says: “he had had so much power over me, had forcibly changed the course of my life, but ultimately much of it had been for the good” (page 242)."
12854,power,or is her statement simply a testament to the power of forgiveness?

12871,power,"toward the end of our time together, with tears streaming down their lovely faces, they made a comment that haunts me still: they said it had been easier for them to experience god’s peace and presence and power inside evin prison than on the outside in america."
12872,evin,evin prison!
12873,alcatraz,the prison in tehran that has a worse reputation than alcatraz or angola in the united states.
12874,evin,or to hear some of their experiences inside evin prison.
12875,torture,"they lovingly and fearlessly presented him to broken women who responded with tearful desperation, to manipulative women who tried to use them for their own purposes, to hostile officials and guards who had the power to torture, to judges who could have released them earlier if they had just been willing to compromise their faith."
12876,evin,"inside the dark hell of evin prison, marcie and miriam turned on the light!"
12877,inside,"their love for the least, their kindness to the meanest, their gentleness to the roughest, their willingness to serve in the dirtiest place imaginable is truly a stunningly clear reflection of the jesus they love, as well as evidence of his presence inside those walls."
12878,prisons,"prisons of physical pain, of financial ruin, of emotional brokenness, of spousal abuse, of marital betrayal ."
12879,captive,captive in iran has strengthened my faith.
12880,where,"i dreamed you had disappeared, and a voice told me you would be in a dark and dreadful place where you would be afraid."
12881,taken,"when he looked at marziyeh and me, he said, “you two will be taken.” with our upcoming trip, and now these two dreams occurring so close together, it was more than a little unsettling."
12882,law,"for a man who was not a relative to enter the apartment, islamic law required that i observe the strict dress code prescribed by the koran."
12883,inside,"“only i will come inside.” when i opened the door, the woman pushed her way in and immediately escorted me to my room to put on acceptable clothes."
12884,warrant,"of course, they had no search warrant, no written orders of any kind."

12886,imprisonment,"this apartment was our home, our refuge, and also the meeting place of a secret church of young people and others who risked imprisonment or death to worship jesus christ with us in violation of the law."
12887,authority,"emboldened by his position and by islamic law—which  places women under the authority of men from age nine, the time girls are considered old enough for marriage—he left no question that we had better cooperate and keep our mouths shut."
12888,charge,"the other basiji—older and taller, with fair skin and green eyes—who seemed to be in charge, took a more conciliatory approach."
12889,law,"“just stay seated and remain calm.” though the two men were clearly in command, they had to have a female chaperone, according to islamic law, in order to enter our home, because we were not relatives of theirs."
12890,police,maybe she was some kind of police officer.
12891,cell,"fortunately, while the basiji were searching, marziyeh and i found an opportunity to hide our cell phones."
12892,state,"unfortunately, i hadn’t turned off the television before the intruders burst in; our tv was illegal because it had satellite service with programming that was uncensored and therefore a threat to the purity of the islamic state."
12893,tortured,“aren’t you afraid of being tortured or raped?” my answer was always the same.
12894,warrant,these people had searched our apartment without a warrant.
12895,arrest,now they were likely to arrest us without bringing any charges.
12896,illegal,"technically, it’s not illegal to be a christian in iran."
12897,authority,"however, in practical terms, policemen, revolutionary guards, judges, and every other authority in the country interpret the law for themselves and aren’t accountable to anyone."
12898,charge,"these two boys and the young woman with them could charge us with anything, or hold us and not charge us at all."
12899,crime,"and though being a christian was not a crime, converting from islam to another faith and evangelizing on behalf of that faith were considered crimes of apostasy and punishable by death."

12902,ordered,"they ordered us to come with them, though we weren’t allowed to take any extra clothes or supplies."
12903,where,we had no idea where they were taking us or when we would be home again.
12904,notorious,"it was evin prison, a notorious compound built during the reign of the shah to hold those who opposed his regime."
12905,prisoners,"since the shah’s fall from power in 1979, evin has been used for political prisoners, solitary confinement, and torture of those considered enemies of the islamic state."
12906,imprisoned,often we had wondered who was imprisoned there and what their lives were like.
12907,building,"finally we pulled up to the police station in the gisha neighborhood, a three-story brick building where people came and went all day for motor vehicle documents."
12908,ordered,"but instead of taking us in through the front door, the basiji ordered us out of the car and escorted us to a quiet back alley out of public view, with extra guards at the door."
12909,state,"this was the entrance to base two, the facility for the security police who deal with crimes against the state."
12910,police,a polite voice on the line informed me of a problem with my car registration and asked me to go to the gisha police station before two o’clock to sort it out.
12911,police,"i remembered that exchange as i went on my errands and visited my sister, elena, before arriving at the police station at about 11:30."
12912,guard,a guard at the door stopped me.
12913,guard,"“i’ve said what i have to say,” the guard replied."
12914,police,"but if you come in dressed that way, you will be ignored and no one will help you.” in the interest of getting to the bottom of the documentation mystery, i went back to the apartment and changed, then returned to the police station."
12915,law,"by then, the office was closed for lunch and for one of the daily calls to prayer required by islamic law."
12916,guard,i explained to the guard that i had been told to be at the office no later than 2:00 p.m.
12917,guard,the guard insisted the office was closed and that no one could help me now.
12918,where,"after several minutes of arguing, i finally convinced him to let me inside, where i explained to the clerk at the counter about the phone call."
12919,police,"“try this office instead.” at that moment, an overweight, middle-aged man in a police uniform walked by."
12920,police,"(haghighat is the farsi word for “truth.” police officials, judges, and other people in the iranian government don’t use their real names."
12921,where,"“follow me.” he led me down a hallway to a sparsely furnished room where a husky man with a big, square face covered with heavy black stubble sat waiting at a table."
12922,police,"young people packed the place, and plainclothes security police watched it constantly."
12923,guard,guard!
12924,officers,"get me two female officers in this room immediately!” the sudden change of atmosphere was startling, and it frightened me for a moment."
12925,arrest,"“you are under arrest,” mr. rasti said as one of the women fastened handcuffs around my wrists."
12926,where,"what about your roommate—where is she now?” “at the dentist,” i replied."
12927,police,"still in handcuffs, i was hustled into a small white police car with the two young men and a young woman named zahra, who beamed at me with a superior air."
12928,where,"maryam before going to the dentist, i had spent part of the morning shopping for the upcoming new year’s celebration, braving crowds so dense i could scarcely walk through the streets, where shop windows were piled high with goods."
12929,lawyer,i had overheard marziyeh’s phone call about the car registration that morning and the call to her lawyer friend asking for advice.
12930,power,"no person, no regime, has the power to change it."
12931,cell,"still worried about marziyeh and the mysterious call, i called her cell phone."
12932,police,"“i’m at home,” marziyeh said, “but i’ll only be here long enough to change clothes so that the clerk at the police station will help me.” “wait till i get there,” i said."
12933,police,"let’s talk it over and think about what to do.” “you’re right that we have to be careful,” marziyeh said, “but i want to get back to the police station and get that taken care of so i can do the rest of my errands."
12934,arrest,i’ll write the address down and leave it for you.” little did i know that marziyeh was walking into a trap and would return home under arrest.
12935,custody,"now we were under arrest and in police custody, and the prospect was a far more serious matter."
12936,inside,"from the look on marziyeh’s face, i could tell she felt the same way i did: trying to appear confident on the outside, but petrified with fright on the inside."
12937,building,these thoughts comforted me as marziyeh and i were escorted through the same crowded building where she had been by herself just a few hours earlier.
12938,taken,we sat down and watched as they brought in everything they had taken from us and stacked it on the desk with all the rest.
12939,ordered,"“sit still and don’t talk to each other,” a female guard ordered."
12940,guilty,chapter 2 the guilty girls marziyeh mr. rasti walked into the room.
12941,guilty,we must have left it at their house.” “take one of the guilty girls and go back for it.
12942,custody,"immediately.” here we had been in custody for only a few minutes, yet we were already “the guilty girls.” still wearing handcuffs, and with her jaw throbbing now that the pain medication had worn off, maryam went with mohammadi and the young policewoman to retrieve the laptop."
12943,guard,"i stayed in the room with a guard, handcuffed."
12944,warrant,"“you ransacked my apartment without a warrant,” i continued."
12945,authority,“without any authority whatsoever.
12946,warrant,"is that the law?” “we have a warrant,” mr. rasti insisted."
12947,case,"in the quick moment i had to glance at it, i could see it was something completely unrelated to our case."
12948,warrant,"“that is not a legal warrant,” i said."
12949,taken,"it’s a fake.” taken aback by my resistance, mr. rasti took a moment to regain his composure."
12950,situation,"“in an urgent situation, we can get permission over the phone,” he said."
12951,taken,"when maryam and her guards returned with the laptop, we were taken to a small room off a beautiful little inner courtyard."
12952,death,"three days after his death, he rose from the dead and ascended to heaven to be with god the father.” the woman with the koran said in a loud voice, “according to the koran, you are kafar!"
12953,escaped,he escaped beforehand.
12954,sentenced,"he came as a prophet, not a savior, and anyone who believes he is the son of god is kafar and will be sentenced to death!"
12955,jail,"i feel very sorry for you.” the female guards all started talking at once, laughing at our claims and the idea that we would sit in jail to uphold such ridiculous beliefs."
12956,guard,another guard came to the door and called my name.
12957,ordered,"“come with me,” she ordered."
12958,freedom,"their safety, freedom, families, and even their lives would suddenly be in danger—and maryam and i would be completely unable to warn them."
12959,where,"“none except for maryam.” “where did you convert to christianity?” “in turkey.” again, this wasn’t exactly true."
12960,where,"“turkey is where maryam and i met each other.” “did you go to church in turkey?” “i lived there for a year, and sometimes i went to church.” “why did you go to church?” “to pray and to get in touch with other iranians in turkey.” “how many people did you give bibles to?” “to my friends there who asked questions, and anybody i thought would like to know about my faith in christ.” “have you given away bibles when you travel?” “i always carry some new testaments with me, and if people ask, i will give them one.” there were more questions: why did i live in my own apartment and not with my parents?"
12961,ordered,"“sign,” he ordered."
12962,interrogation,"after i signed, a guard took me back to the room where maryam waited and took maryam upstairs for her interrogation by mr. rasti."
12963,authorities,"this is a common interrogation method: tell a lie about what the other person said on the chance the suspect will admit something she wouldn’t otherwise, because she’s duped into thinking the authorities already know about it."
12964,illegal,"“do you know it is illegal to speak about jesus or give away bibles?” “no,” i said."
12965,where,"“maybe ten or twelve people a year, and i handed out about the same number of new testaments.” there were questions where i could avoid saying anything that would harm others, and not tell a lie."
12966,question,"but this question could lead down a trail of more questions and tragedy for others, and i would not say anything that would put people in danger."
12967,interrogation,"although i didn’t know it at the time, i had just made the same choice that marziyeh had made during her interrogation."
12968,interrogation,"before i believed, before i ever set foot in a church, i heard his voice calling me and i answered.” mr. rasti motioned to a stack of notes he had made during the interrogation, with the questions in red and answers in black."
12969,death,“i would not risk destroying my life after death to write down lies on this paper!
12970,police,i had been at the police station since late afternoon and was too exhausted and too sore from my dental appointment to argue.
12971,where,"i did as instructed, then was taken back to the office where marziyeh waited."
12972,custody,"it was nearly midnight when another guard came in and said, “you will remain in custody."
12973,detention,i will take you to the detention center.” prisoners were not housed at the police station.
12974,locked,we had to go across town in order to be locked up.
12975,charge,"“what is the charge against you?” he asked, reaching for a form."
12976,guard,"“advertising and promoting christianity,” added our guard as she handcuffed us to each other."
12977,detention,you’re not in custody for believing in jesus; you’re in custody for promoting him to others.” we got into another dirty little white car and were driven to the vozara detention center.
12978,charged,"inside, an officer asked our guard what we were charged with."
12979,charge,“is there really any such charge as that?” our guard said nothing.
12980,charge,"another officer, rough looking and overweight, seemed to be in charge."
12981,charged,"“that’s what we’ve been charged with,” marziyeh added."
12982,charged,"“no,” the man in charge insisted, “you are not charged with being christians."
12983,case,most probably yours will be a political case.
12984,court,"if the court can prove you’ve been supported by someone from the outside in promoting christianity, the charge will be spying.” we were led down a long flight of stairs into a basement, through a series of steel doors, and past a small room with a red carpet and an oil heater."
12985,where,“is this where we’re staying?” i asked marziyeh.
12986,jail,it was our first time inside any sort of jail.
12987,prisoners,"we had no idea that what we had seen was a break room for the staff, nothing like the rooms where prisoners lived."
12988,where,"we were escorted into a room where two sleepy, grumpy female guards waited for us."
12989,ordered,"“hand over all your belongings,” one of them ordered."
12990,prisoners,the guards said it was to keep prisoners from smuggling in drugs.
12991,ordered,"“take a blanket from the stack and find yourselves a spot,” the guard ordered as she clanged the door shut behind us."
12992,toilet,the floor of the toilet area was awash in muck from two overflowing commodes; the trash bin was piled high with used sanitary pads.
12993,cell,"chapter 3 the road to vozara marziyeh “for god’s sake, won’t somebody give me a damn cigarette!” the voice that jarred us awake was half scream, half animal cry, mixed with the grating, rattling noise of somebody shaking the bars of the cell-block door at the end of the hallway."
12994,detention,it took a minute to remember that maryam and i were under arrest and had spent the night in the detention center.
12995,detention,"the detention center was in a basement twenty steps down from street level, its walls lined with dark, damp, dirty stone blocks."
12996,cell,our cell was one of ten or so opening onto a narrow hallway.
12997,wall,"at the end of the hall, we saw the door in the wall of bars where we had come in."
12998,wall,that door led to a small room with another wall of bars at the far end.
12999,wall,"in that far wall was another door, which opened to another long hallway."
13000,cell,to the left in the hall was the entrance to the cell block with steps going up; to the right was an office or dayroom where the guards stayed.
13001,locked,"we later learned that they were locked at night when the cells were crowded, and remained locked until morning."
13002,ordered,"the door at the end of the hallway clattered open and two female guards, wearing masks to protect them from the nasty odors, came in and ordered us to fold our blankets and stack them in the corner."
13003,locked,"we could see now that there were fifteen or so women locked up in our area, ranging from teenagers to middle age."
13004,acquitted,"over the next few days, we would see countless women come and go as they were either transferred to prison or acquitted and released."
13005,jail,"the jail didn’t serve breakfast, and of course we were unprepared."
13006,prisoner,"fortunately, another prisoner kindly shared some biscuits with us."
13007,sink,"there was no soap, tissue, towels, or running water in the sink."
13008,detention,"with that memorable experience behind us, we set out to meet some of the other prisoners and learn more about the detention center."
13009,guard,"we saw the woman who had screamed at us and kicked us earlier, now sitting on the floor of the hallway smoking a cigarette a guard had given her."
13010,cell,"the vozara detention center was not a place where strangers were friendly to each other, especially to crazy-sounding people who woke the cell block every morning screaming for a cigarette."
13011,abuse,"the screaming woman told us her story, the first of many heartbreaking accounts of abuse and desperation we would hear behind bars in the days that followed."
13012,arrested,she had been arrested two days before for buying drugs on the street.
13013,arrested,she had been arrested buying opium in a park; it was her second offense.
13014,crime,“for believing in jesus christ.” they had no idea christianity was a crime and asked us to tell them more about jesus.
13015,freedom,"with tears brimming in her beautiful eyes, she begged, “please pray for my freedom."
13016,cell,this experience made us think that other women in the cell block might allow us to pray for them.
13017,cell,"we came to a cell that was still dark, with two figures wrapped in blankets on the floor."
13018,inmates,"they had been locked up for three days and were terrified of the other inmates, many of them rough and loud like leila."
13019,arrested,"while they were waiting, the basiji appeared and arrested them."
13020,custody,everyone in the room was taken into custody for improper contact between unrelated muslim men and women.
13021,where,"the girls hadn’t been allowed to call their families, so their parents didn’t know where they were."
13022,authorities,they were terrified of what the authorities might do to them and of what their families would think when they found out.
13023,cell,"they asked if they could stay with us—and before we could answer, they picked up their blankets and took them to our cell."
13024,cell,"we went to another cell, which was the biggest one on the hall."
13025,inside,"there were six or seven middle-aged women huddled together inside, well-dressed and obviously out of place."
13026,arrested,maryam greeted them and asked why they’d been arrested.
13027,crime,“is christianity really a crime?” “how long have you been christians?” “how did they find out about you?” “what will happen to you now?” they were intensely curious about this religion that was so harshly condemned by the authorities.
13028,arrested,"when the basiji came to break up the protest, they arrested anyone they could grab, including this woman and her friends."
13029,locked,"these innocent shoppers had spent the entire night locked in the back of a police car, all squeezed together,  before being transported to vozara."
13030,jail,one of them had been beaten by a teenage basiji but hadn’t had any medical attention during the three days she had been in jail.
13031,guard,"in the middle of the day, a guard unlocked the hallway door and slid a big saucepan down the grimy hall floor."
13032,detention,"the meal was symbolic of the way the detention center staff looked at everyone under their control: subhuman, unworthy of any respect, locked in filthy cages, and treated like mongrels."
13033,cell,"two young women, who had been arrested for attending a party where men were present, were banging on the bars of the cell-block door and calling for a guard."
13034,guard,"after a long time, a guard finally appeared."
13035,guard,"when the girl explained what she needed, the guard said, “use one of the blankets.” “please,” the girl begged, “i’m bleeding.” “so go die,” the guard replied."
13036,guard,"shut up!” the guard yelled, then turned away."
13037,guard,"an hour later, the guard came back with a single pad and threw it at the girl through the bars."
13038,cell,"now quit complaining.” later that evening, another disturbance erupted as fifteen or so young women, all attractive and very fashionably dressed, were herded through the hallway door of our cell block."
13039,arrested,they had been arrested by the basiji at a weekend family party on charges of having unhealthy and un-islamic relationships with men.
13040,prisoners,"after a few minutes, several of the women came over to maryam and me because they said we looked and acted differently from the rest of the prisoners."
13041,charges,"when we told them the charges against us, they asked us to pray for them, especially the one in their group who was pregnant."
13042,cell,"they couldn’t all fit into our tiny cell, so they crowded in the doorway as we prayed that they would soon be released and that their families wouldn’t suffer any harassment or embarrassment because of what had happened."
13043,prisoners,prisoners came and went all day.
13044,custody,"by the end of the evening, there were considerably more women in custody than there had been in the morning."
13045,cell,we moved to a slightly bigger cell so there would be room for us and our two new friends to stretch out on the floor.
13046,prisoners,"though these guards slept most of the night, they had to be there when new prisoners came in late or in case of a disturbance."
13047,detention,"the lights went out, and we were left alone with our thoughts and the night sounds of the detention center."
13048,inside,"maybe it represented a part of her, deep inside, that remained pure and untouched by all the sadness and tragedy in her life."
13049,situation,"on the surface, our situation was a complete disaster; but in another way, it was an incredible blessing."
13050,death,"first separately, and then together, we had spent years working to share the truth about jesus in a country where evangelizing muslims was punishable by death."
13051,state,"we grew up in a country that indoctrinates children in the state religion from the youngest ages, when they are most impressionable."
13052,death,"then we chanted, “death to  america!"
13053,death,death to israel!” though we had no idea what “america” and “israel” were.
13054,locked,"we did this too, because the authorities locked the schools and forced us to go."
13055,where,"i wanted to be baptized in the official church in tehran, where we attended, but the regime monitored the church closely and frowned on church baptisms."
13056,serving,"though i was only  nineteen, the pastors asked me to start serving in the church, speaking to new believers and working with a group of elderly ladies."
13057,sharia,but i always had many questions about god that islamic theology and sharia law could not answer.
13058,where,"when i obeyed, the horse took me to a city where worshipers coming out of a mosque were performing the islamic ashura and tasua ceremonies, mournful chanting and self-beating."
13059,power,"as i held fast to its neck, i felt its love pouring into me with a power and purity i had never known."
13060,where,"after we eluded our pursuers, the horse came to a fork in the road where one path turned up into the sky."
13061,pen,"later, at my medical appointment, the doctor picked up his pen to write me a prescription."
13062,where,that’s where i met maryam.
13063,where,"maryam god made us a team and brought us back to tehran, where we labored for three exhausting, exhilarating years, handing out accurate modern translations of the new testament in farsi to supplant the islamic versions allowed in the public shops, which had been rewritten to support the koran."
13064,police,"at that moment, a fight broke out between the police and a driver one or two cars ahead of us."
13065,case,"whenever marziyeh and i walked around the city, we always carried ten or fifteen new testaments in a backpack, in case we had the chance to give one away."
13066,where,the man said he’d had a dream in which jesus told him to get a bible and go to a quiet place in the mountains where he could talk with him.
13067,where,we often went to a place in tehran where young people liked to go walking.
13068,where,the more expensive ones pick you up at a prearranged point and take you directly where you want to go.
13069,arrest,"yet despite our commitment and dedication, for the last couple of months before our arrest, we had inexplicably been unable to evangelize."
13070,detention,"now, surrounded by the dark, somber walls of the vozara detention center, we could see it was the lord protecting us and our friends."
13071,arrested,"if we had continued as usual with the police on our tail, many others would have been arrested along with us for meeting with us and accepting a new testament."
13072,jail,"now we were stuck in jail, and god was bringing spiritual seekers to us in waves."
13073,prisoners,and we could tell our fellow prisoners the story of jesus openly because no one would come into this rat hole to spy on us.
13074,court,chapter 4 a sign of honor maryam we had been imprisoned in vozara too late on thursday to go to court.
13075,case,so saturday was the first day that our case could be heard.
13076,toilet,"we awoke again to the sound of leila screaming for a cigarette, visited the toilet facilities, and got a breakfast biscuit from the same generous woman who had given us one the day before."
13077,court,the morning routine was for a guard to call out the names of the women going to court that day.
13078,court,"prisoners gathered at the cell-block door one group at a time as their names were called, depending on which court they were going to."
13079,guard,then a guard herded them upstairs to ground level.
13080,court,"if it was a small group, the guard took them in a car or taxi to their court appearance."
13081,arrested,"because everyone in vozara had come directly from being arrested, no one had any luggage or belongings beyond whatever they happened to have at the time."
13082,court,"they took everything with them to court, in case they were set free."
13083,court,"in court, the judge would decide whether a woman would be released, returned to detention, or sent to prison to await trial."
13084,detention,inmates were not supposed to stay more than three days in detention.
13085,custody,"because we had arrived late on thursday, this was technically our third day in custody (though only our second morning at vozara), and we expected to be called, have our case resolved, and be released."
13086,arrested,"the chic young party girls who spoke english were all called, as were the women who had been arrested outside the bakery."
13087,cell,"after a while, the cell block was empty except for leila, sephideh, marziyeh, and me."
13088,exercise,"as we were walking up and down the hall to get a little exercise, two guards came to the hall doorway with some cleaning supplies."
13089,ordered,"they handed us two brooms, a mop, and a bucket and ordered us to clean the cells."
13090,cell,"marziyeh and i swept and mopped the cell floors and the hallway, including the passage to the guard office, and last of all the toilets."
13091,custody,plus we were very thirsty; we hadn’t had a drink of water during our two days in custody.
13092,cell,"but it wasn’t long before she and sephideh woke us up, shaking the cell-block door and screaming for cigarettes."
13093,court,"late in the day, the other women began returning from court."
13094,court,"the ladies from the bakery had been taken to revolutionary court, where political cases were decided, but the judge hadn’t heard their case, so they were back in detention for another day."
13095,where,"several were crying in frustration, worried about their children and wanting some way to tell their families where they were."
13096,charges,we heard that the big group of party girls had been released and the charges against them dismissed.
13097,charged,"also returning were two young girls with beautiful long hair, who had come in the day before charged with being improperly dressed."
13098,court,her parents had been in court when she was brought in.
13099,prisoners,"new prisoners also arrived, including an attractive girl of sixteen or seventeen with her hair cut short like a boy."
13100,arrested,she had run away from home and been arrested for shaving her head.
13101,charged,“what are you charged with?” she asked us.
13102,charge,“what is your charge?” i asked.
13103,arrested,i was arrested for sleeping in the park.
13104,state,"the police said i should have registered with social services.” behzisty, the state welfare organization of iran, is notorious for the abusive way it treats people who go there for help."
13105,cell,"marziyeh the next morning, after the usual “alarm clock” of leila screaming for cigarettes, maryam and i visited the much-improved toilets, listened to name after name being announced by the guard, and watched as one woman after another left the cell block."
13106,prisoners,"after a while, she and i were the only two prisoners left."
13107,guard,"as we were about to return to our room to rest, we heard the guard call our names."
13108,court,“maryam rostampour and marziyeh amirizadeh?” “yes?” “it’s time to prepare yourselves for court.” we were led to an inspection room where sayeh was already waiting.
13109,guard,"the guard handcuffed the three of us together, with sayeh in the middle, and took us up the stairs."
13110,police,the sunlight almost blinded us as we walked out the door toward the police car.
13111,detention,what a relief from the chill of the detention center!
13112,tortured,“are you being tortured?
13113,tortured,are you being tortured?” they asked over and over.
13114,police,we told them in a whisper about a supply of new testaments the police hadn’t found yet and asked them to hide them for us.
13115,guard,“you’re not allowed to have that!” the guard barked at us.
13116,ordered,“into the car!” the guard ordered.
13117,guard,the guard rode up front with the soldier who was driving.
13118,courthouse,both of them held their noses all the way to the courthouse.
13119,court,"after delivering sayeh to the family court, maryam and i went on to the revolutionary court, a huge brick building that is famous in tehran."
13120,prisoners,"we came in through a back door, where prisoners enter so the public can’t see them, then into a small room where guards searched us."
13121,court,"inside, the revolutionary court was a maze of rooms, long corridors, and elevators."
13122,court,"still handcuffed together, we walked upstairs to a waiting area outside enghelab court, branch 2, of the security police."
13123,arrested,the ladies who had been arrested at the bakery with the we are flash mob were there with their families and were happy to see us.
13124,guard,our guard warned us to sit still.
13125,charges,they heard us talking to a couple of  lawyers in the room about our charges and started asking questions.
13126,arrested,"“why have you been arrested?” “because we are christians,” i said."
13127,charge,“what a charge!
13128,guard,"were you involved in any church activities?” at that moment, our guard told the man with all the questions to stand up."
13129,police,"she then took his seat next to maryam, leaned over to us, and said quietly, “these are plainclothes secret police, the basiji."
13130,guard,they are trying to collect damaging information about you.” this guard from vozara had sympathy for us and was trying to protect us.
13131,arrested,they had been arrested with the women at the bakery and badly beaten by the basiji.
13132,courtroom,"the ladies went into the courtroom, declared their innocence, and told the judge they wanted to file complaints against the basiji."
13133,bail,"the judge replied that if they would not file any complaints, he would release them on bail."
13134,locked,"if they insisted on pressing charges, they would stay locked up."
13135,charges,"however, as so often happens in iranian courts, the charges were not officially dropped."
13136,charges,"once the bail was paid, the women were free to go, but the charges against them remained on the books indefinitely, in case the government wanted to pressure them in the future."
13137,court,"every judge in the revolutionary court has a large, impressive office."
13138,court,"he was mr. sobhani, the judge for the revolutionary court who had received our case from mr. rasti at police headquarters."
13139,wall,"on the wall were photos of iranian soldiers fighting and dying, some of them covered with blood."
13140,power,"there were photos of ayatollah khomeini, who had seized power from the shah in 1979, and ayatollah khamenei, the current supreme leader of iran."
13141,courtroom,the courtroom was a monument to martyrs for islam.
13142,ordered,the judge wrote out a list of questions for each of us and ordered us to write the answers without talking to each other.
13143,charge,"they were the same questions we had already answered many times, and our answers were practically identical: do you accept the charge of advertising activities against the regime and insulting religious authorities?"
13144,charge,do you accept the charge of promoting christianity in iran?
13145,charge,do you accept the charge of distributing bibles and evangelizing in a restaurant in tehran?
13146,detention,"back in the car, as the driver navigated the heavy noontime traffic, i assumed we were returning to the detention center."
13147,police,"instead, we were taken to the gisha police station and soon found ourselves face-to-face again with our old friend mr. rasti."
13148,prisoners,"“have you?” i wondered if he knew how hungry we were, or if he always ate in front of prisoners."
13149,prisoners,we have other ways of getting prisoners to communicate.
13150,taken,we had to hang the signs around our necks and have our pictures taken.
13151,interrogation,"think  about that as you prepare for your interrogation.” pushing back abruptly from the table, he walked out, leaving us with “mr."
13152,arrest,"truth,” the first policeman we’d met at gisha the day of our arrest."
13153,police,mr. haghighat took us to the basement of the police station to await our interrogation.
13154,hole,"as we eventually discovered, there actually wasn’t any plumbing at all; the toilet was simply a hole in the floor."
13155,building,"who could have imagined that such a big, impressive-looking building contained such a squalid room?"
13156,imprisoned,"of all the places we were imprisoned in the months ahead, this turned out to be the worst."
13157,power,"if we are tortured, give us the power to stand fast."
13158,death,"famished and exhausted, we fell asleep, even as we waited for the sound of death at the door."
13159,guard,"but instead of the rough-looking character we expected, a female guard came in with two young women, both of them crying."
13160,arrested,"the women were sisters who had been arrested for using goldquest, an internet business networking site that had been banned in iran."
13161,guard,"the sight of her, screaming and struggling against the guard, petrified the sisters."
13162,court,that’s what she had told us when she left for court that morning.
13163,bail,her husband was coming to pay her bail and get her out.
13164,guard,"finally, a guard appeared and said, “shut up!"
13165,law,"your husband should come and get you.” as a married woman, leila couldn’t be released except to her husband, according to the law."
13166,death,death to you and to the regime!” the guard disappeared without a word.
13167,bail,"as the day went on, leila was told that if she could come up with bail money of 30,000 tomans (fifteen dollars), they would let her out."
13168,bail,there had been no bail offer; the guards were only teasing.
13169,arrest,this was when we first learned that others had heard about our arrest and were trying to help.
13170,torture,"as our case became known, we hoped that news of christians being threatened with torture or death by the islamic regime would encourage the faithful to pray for us and work for our release."
13171,freedom,we hoped this meant our freedom was coming soon.
13172,cell,"inside vozara, we were asked a now-familiar series of questions, this time by the warden of the detention center, before they allowed us back into our cell."
13173,court,"“you gain nothing by making them angry.” “the court will decide,” the warden continued."
13174,cell,"“then you’ll see what’s what!” we went to the familiar detention cell block, chose a couple of stinky blankets, and wrapped ourselves up on the floor."
13175,inside,images and experiences of the day swirled around inside my head like a crazy kaleidoscope.
13176,justice,"without a bed, without a meal, without even a hint of justice, we had been spared by the mercy of god."
13177,exercise,"chapter 5 new friends, old questions marziyeh monday, march 9, began with leila’s usual racket, though it was affecting us less every day because we were getting used to it and because we were waking up weaker from lack of food and exercise."
13178,court,the guard called out the names of women to be taken to court.
13179,evin,"the guards told her that since her husband had not come for her, she would be transferred to evin prison."
13180,notorious,"evin was notorious as a place where people who committed crimes against islam—which were also crimes against the regime—were held indefinitely, often tortured, and sometimes killed."
13181,detention,she was going there simply because her three days in detention were up.
13182,detention,our three days of detention were more than up.
13183,evin,"if leila was headed to evin, we might be sent there too."
13184,prisoners,"only a handful of prisoners remained after roll call, including sahar, the attractive young runaway with the close-cropped hair, and a new arrival we were anxious to meet, named masomeh, a short, beautiful woman with friendly looking eyes."
13185,taken,we had taken this on as our regular morning job.
13186,prisoners,"the guards got their drinking water from the kitchen, which was off-limits to the prisoners."
13187,prisoners,"“you two are not like the other prisoners,” one of the guards told us."
13188,charges,"what are the charges against you?” after we explained, she said, “you’re too good to be here."
13189,locked,it’s a shame for innocent people like you to be locked up.
13190,cell,"i hope they release you soon.” another guard, who had overheard part of our conversation, asked, “what are they here for?” when the first guard told her, she went berserk, flailing her hands at us and shouting, “they deserve to be in detention!” with surprising strength, she pushed us roughly down the hall into our cell and locked the door."
13191,cell,"a little while later, we were taken outside the cell block to an office where two male inspectors and two female guards awaited us."
13192,charge,“what is your charge?” one of the men asked.
13193,court,it will cause problems for you.” he then asked about our trip to the revolutionary court and what conditions were like in the cell block at vozara.
13194,cell,"“i hope you will soon be free.” back in our cell block, we introduced ourselves to some of the new prisoners."
13195,arrested,"one was a short, chubby woman who had been arrested for check fraud."
13196,police,then one night the security police burst in on them in her bedroom.
13197,police,she told the police when they would be together and used her influence as the daughter of a martyr to convince the judge to order the man to marry her.
13198,court,"when he appeared in court later that day, it was apparent he had already been lashed."
13199,arrested,she ran away and was arrested.
13200,freedom,"we tried to talk her out of it, but for her this was a ticket to freedom and financial independence."
13201,inmate,"another new inmate, tannaz, a sixteen-year-old girl from the city of mashhad, wore skinny jeans and a revealing black top."
13202,arrested,she had been arrested while having sex in a park.
13203,police,she boasted that she had police files all over the country.
13204,executed,"when she heard our story, she declared that we must be executed as infidels."
13205,prisoners,"“i have heard from some of the prisoners that you pray for them and your prayers are answered,” she began."
13206,detainees,"the detainees come and go, but i’m stuck here day after day, month after month, in this horrible underground hole.” she went back to the office, but returned a little while later with a plate of pasta and two spoons."
13207,court,"as the afternoon wore on, prisoners began returning from court."
13208,bail,we heard that the goldquest sisters had been released on bail and that sayeh had been transferred to social services.
13209,cell,"some of our acquaintances returned to the cell block while others we never saw or heard from again, and there were new arrivals constantly."
13210,inmates,"when the guard came in with the usual pan of lentils and rice, instead of sliding it across the floor to where the inmates waited to dig in with their hands, she shouted for the women to stand back."
13211,guard,marziyeh will serve the rest of you.” i was stunned—the “unclean” christian being chosen to handle everyone’s meals—but i quickly stepped forward to do as the guard had said.
13212,prisoners,"the culinary surprises continued the next morning, when a guard brought all the prisoners breakfast: a small bag of bread and cheese, one bag for each two prisoners."
13213,court,"instead of returning to the revolutionary court as we expected, we were again taken to the gisha police station."
13214,interrogation,"there we were separated, and marziyeh waited while i went in for another interrogation with mr. rasti."
13215,guard,a young female guard was also in the room.
13216,police,could this be the same police officer who had been so rude and threatening before?
13217,court,who’d had us hauled off to the revolutionary court in handcuffs?
13218,locked,“it’s a shame for you to be locked up in a place like vozara.
13219,power,"when we weren’t feeding people spiritually, we were feeding them physically, filling the table night after night with good food to share as we talked about jesus and his power in our lives."
13220,torture,to leave islam for christianity was to risk torture and death.
13221,question,is there a problem with that?” mr. rasti ignored my question and plowed ahead with even more of his own.
13222,arrest,"“i want to know why you became a christian.” i recognized him as the officer i’d seen on the day of our arrest, the one who had told me there must be a mistake and there was no problem with my car registration."
13223,where,"jesus says, ‘seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.’[2] you need a heart that seeks truth, and the lord will reveal the truth to you.” the other guard came over to where we were sitting."
13224,guard,"if you really want answers, pray to the lord in your own language—it is not necessary to pray only in arabic—and ask him to show you the truth.” the first guard was delighted with this advice, but his partner was still unconvinced."
13225,guard,"after more than two hours, another guard came to take me for my interview."
13226,tortured,“we’re not being tortured.
13227,taken,"“we found pictures on your laptop that were taken in korea,” mr. rasti began."
13228,where,"fortunately, no one had discovered any more information about the trip maryam and i had taken to south korea, where christianity is thriving."
13229,where,"through a series of friendships, we had been invited to a leadership conference there, where the other participants were pastors’ wives or other kinds of church leaders."
13230,where,"what a contrast it was to india, where we had gone to share the message of christ with prostitutes and learn how to minister to them."
13231,authorities,"fortunately, the iranian authorities never found evidence of this work either."
13232,where,"when we visited red-light districts where young prostitutes lived, we had to travel with bodyguards."
13233,interrogation,"after my interrogation, i was reunited with maryam and we compared notes on our sessions."
13234,cell,"we were taken to a dirty, dark cell under the stairwell and left alone."
13235,charges,"when we explained the charges against us, she asked us to pray for her."
13236,escaped,she escaped to her parents’ house and filed for divorce.
13237,law,"but under islamic law, only the husband can seek a divorce."
13238,arrested,"her husband, who had been following her, alerted the basiji and had her arrested, claiming she was cheating on him with the man who gave her the ride."
13239,court,"even though the husband had no proof to support his charge, the word of a man officially carries twice the weight of a woman’s testimony in islamic court."
13240,prisoner,"another prisoner came in, a slim girl with short hair, whose name was sharareh."
13241,arrested,she had been arrested for drinking and dancing with some boys at an amusement park.
13242,where,there were wounds on her body where the basiji had hit her.
13243,arrested,"why don’t you relax and let me sing you a little lullaby so you can fall asleep in my arms?” though it was illegal for her to flirt with boys, it was evidently all right for the basiji who arrested her to flirt with her—even as they were beating her."
13244,guard,maryam it was nearly midnight by the time a guard named mrs. najimi came to take us back to vozara.
13245,guard,"during the time when marziyeh was being interrogated, i’d had a run-in with this guard."
13246,interrogation,"after my own interrogation, i had worried about marziyeh and started praying for her out loud."
13247,arrest,"as we rode, she asked, “why did they arrest you?” “for being christians.” “and what’s wrong with that, my darling?” “you’ll have to ask mr. rasti.” “something really bad happened to me this afternoon,” she said haltingly."
13248,detention,"i was nasty to you today, but i didn’t mean it.” she asked both of us about our faith, and we answered her questions all the way to the detention center."
13249,punishment,"time and again, i was discovering that even the employees of the iranian regime—guards, soldiers, police officers, court officials—yearned for the truth of christ in their hearts, but feared to ask about him because of the harsh punishment awaiting those who seek the truth."
13250,cell,"when the driver returned, we went down to our cell block, where everyone had waited up to learn what had happened to us: masomeh, the martyr’s daughter; sahar, with the short hair; tannaz, the flirtatious young girl from mashhad; and others, along with several new prisoners, including a korean woman whose visa had expired."
13251,cell,"she asked to sleep in our cell, which was already crowded with other  women, including masomeh and sahar, who all wanted to be near us like little frightened girls around their mothers."
13252,court,"chapter 6 celebration of faith maryam the next two days, thursday and friday, the court was closed, which meant vozara was crowded and busy because new inmates kept arriving and nobody left."
13253,prisoner,the first new prisoner we saw was a young woman who was very well dressed and seemed afraid of everyone around her.
13254,evin,"her first experience behind bars had been watching leila—who was back from evin after only a short stay—go through her morning routine, screaming for a cigarette."
13255,detention,“i never thought people like you would be in a detention center.” she was a law student who earned her school expenses by giving skin and beauty treatments.
13256,arrested,"when the check was rejected by the bank, the landlord had her arrested."
13257,prisoners,"by now, our prayers were a familiar sound to our fellow prisoners, but somehow this time was different."
13258,cell,"as we continued, the other inmates stopped talking—one by one—and started listening, until our voices alone echoed off the walls of the cell block."
13259,detention,the vozara detention center had become a church.
13260,prisoner,tannaz was the only prisoner who still shied away from us.
13261,prisoners,“what happened?” one of the prisoners demanded as the girl came closer.
13262,freed,"“pray that i would be freed soon and have a good life from now on.” we took her outstretched hands and prayed for her until dinnertime, when a guard arrived with the big dish and everyone waited patiently while marziyeh served up the meal on little plates of bread."
13263,justice,it’s hard to imagine a justice system worthy of the name that considers it essential to national security to separate a mother from her newborn baby over a visa problem.
13264,cell,the guards brought her to our cell so she wouldn’t be as afraid.
13265,law,she had been skiing in the mountains with her boyfriend when the basiji stopped her and said her hair was not properly covered according to islamic law.
13266,arrested,"when the boyfriend confronted them for criticizing her, they were both arrested."
13267,charge,"she hit one of the basiji, who lodged a personal complaint against her on top of the other charge."
13268,freedom,"as she headed for her freedom, marziyeh and i reminded her of the promises she’d made to visit a church."
13269,arrested,"they were madams, arrested on the street for soliciting customers for their girls."
13270,exercise,"one was a very aggressive lesbian who was immediately attracted to marziyeh, eyeing her as she walked up and down the hallway to get a little exercise."
13271,cell,"fortunately for us, none of the madams ended up in our cell for the night, though i was awakened more than once by the sound of two of the women in the throes of lesbian passion."
13272,where,"these women reminded me of our ministry to prostitutes in india, where the hindu religion also enslaves women."
13273,situation,"rather than offering assistance, the regime made the situation worse by forcing women to marry men they didn’t love, forcing them to stay in abusive relationships, and making it almost impossible to get a divorce."
13274,court,"on saturday, it was off to court for most of the prisoners, as usual."
13275,bail,the skier was released on bail.
13276,cell,sharareh and tannaz left the cell block and never came back.
13277,where,another of the group had been raped as a young teenager in a house where she worked as a maid.
13278,court,"after masomeh and the transsexual returned from court, the two of them got into a loud argument."
13279,arrested,"we still weren’t sure we had the whole story on masomeh, the martyr’s daughter who had set up her boyfriend to be arrested and lashed by the basiji."
13280,where,"after listening for a minute, the transsexual asked if the apartment where they were caught was at a certain address."
13281,arrested,"he was the wealthy one, and you had him arrested so you could take everything from him!” normally brash and outspoken, masomeh was struck dumb by this exposé of her past."
13282,toilet,"“i have to go to the toilet,” she said, and left the room."
13283,case,"later, we learned she was having an affair with the judge in her case."
13284,guilty,"he knew she was guilty of defrauding her lover; but in exchange for her sexual favors, the judge forced her boyfriend to marry her, and then sent him to prison so that masomeh could keep his property and she and the judge could continue their relationship."
13285,situation,this is not an uncommon situation.
13286,bail,a different judge had offered to release one of the madams on bail if she would give him her phone number.
13287,cell,"one day, a kindlooking middle-aged woman came to the cell block while we were cleaning and asked us why we were at vozara."
13288,jail,"“we’re in jail for our faith in christ,” i explained."
13289,detention,"she was the custodian, hired to clean the whole detention center."
13290,cell,"she admitted that, until that moment, she had never even been to our cell block."
13291,guilt,"perhaps tinged with guilt, she gave the floor a few halfhearted strokes with a broom and then said, “i hear you pray for everyone here."
13292,cell,"though it was after midnight, i went to her cell."
13293,authorities,the authorities knew more about them than they knew about themselves.
13294,law,"her elderly father had stomach trouble that he treated by drinking a little wine, even though alcohol is strictly forbidden by islamic law."
13295,authorities,a neighbor saw the wine in a cabinet at their house and alerted the authorities.
13296,arrested,"with the pilot and his family arrested by the basiji, the neighbor hoped to be promoted to the pilot’s position."
13297,court,"when a guard came for maryam and me the next morning, we assumed we were going back to the police station or to the revolutionary court."
13298,police,"we walked outside in handcuffs, but instead of the usual police car or van waiting for us, there was a taxi, and beside it stood a man who introduced himself as mr. yazdani."
13299,case,mr. yazdani carried a dossier in his hand and seemed to know something about us and our case.
13300,court,"on the way to the revolutionary court, he asked us why we couldn’t accept mohammed and jesus both."
13301,situation,"“it’s a shame that girls like you have been caught in this type of situation.” when we arrived at the courthouse, the driver told us the total fare."
13302,police,he insisted the police hadn’t paid him.
13303,guard,a young female guard came over to see what we were laughing about.
13304,guard,"the young guard started giggling, too, and was soon redfaced and laughing as hard as we were."
13305,prisoners,“are these girls your prisoners or your friends?” he barked at the guard.
13306,guard,"after the judge disappeared back into his office, the guard resumed her conversation with us."
13307,prisoners,he tended to be far more lenient with prisoners who flattered him and begged for mercy.
13308,prisoner,"a new prisoner lay on the floor in front of our cell, a teenager addicted to crystal meth and going through withdrawal."
13309,cell,"“get in your cell, you stupid trash!” the girl was completely helpless."
13310,cell,the guard kicked her into our cell like a pile of old rags.
13311,toilet,"i called for the guard to unlock our door so i could go to the toilet, but my cries went unanswered."
13312,sink,"when  the door was unlocked at last, i washed my clothes in the sink and wore my coat while they dried."
13313,prisoners,"with the new year’s holiday approaching, most of the prisoners were called and set free that morning, leaving only a few of the madams, the young addict from the night before, and maryam and me."
13314,court,"by the end of the day, every prisoner except the two of us had been called to court, and all but one had been released on bail."
13315,cell,we were left in the cell block completely alone.
13316,cell,"we walked down the hall together, going into each cell and remembering the women we’d met there."
13317,detention,"by law, prisoners were to spend no more than three days at the vozara detention center, yet we had now been there for two weeks."
13318,authorities,"during that time, we had witnessed to dozens of women we never would have met if the authorities had followed the usual three-day rule."
13319,arrested,the people who arrested us thought we were suffering in misery.
13320,cell,"now, as we entered each cell, we prayed for all the people who had been locked up there."
13321,freedom,"we hoped they now had their freedom, that we had been faithful witnesses to them, and that they would continue to listen for the spirit of christ moving in their hearts."
13322,locked,then we started thinking about the women who would be locked up there after we were gone.
13323,where,there were damp places on the walls where little chunks of plaster had fallen off.
13324,prisoners,"using these pieces of plaster as chalk, we wrote bible verses and christian messages all over the walls, and on the ceilings where prisoners could read them as they fell asleep."
13325,cell,"all alone in an underground prison cell, we shared a joyous celebration of faith."
13326,court,maryam and i went back to the revolutionary court and waited outside the magistrate’s office while mr. yazdani went in to talk to mr. sobhani again.
13327,freedom,"this time, the magistrate gave us an option for gaining our freedom, knowing it was impossible for us to carry it out."
13328,trial,"if we could come up with two hundred million tomans ($100,000) per person by five o’clock that afternoon, he would release us on bail until our case went to trial."
13329,evin,otherwise we were to be transferred immediately to evin prison.
13330,court,"prisoners have to be offered bail before they can be transferred to evin, so the court had to go through the motions, even though we couldn’t possibly arrange for that large of a payment on such short notice."
13331,acquitted,"we knew we’d never get it back, even if we were acquitted."
13332,detention,"our two faithful sisters, elena and shirin, came to the detention center every day, in case we were taken somewhere."
13333,court,they followed us to court or to the police station to exchange a few words and slip us something to eat or drink while we walked from the car into the building.
13334,police,today they were behind the police vehicle when our driver had a minor accident.
13335,arrest,"while we waited in the van for the police to sort everything out, we had a solid hour to talk to them—by far the longest conversation we’d had since our arrest."
13336,evin,"after being taken to the police station to get some forms, we were shocked to discover we were headed to evin prison."
13337,imprisoned,"it was hard to believe that we were about to enter one of the world’s most notorious prisons, imprisoned only for our faith in god."
13338,evin,"then we walked through the tall, imposing entrance gate with “evin prison” written across the top, out of the spring sunshine and into another world."
13339,evin,"chapter 7 evin, our church maryam the entrance to evin prison was on a hill."
13340,gate,"in contrast to the huge front gate, the door we passed through next was small."
13341,inside,"the first little room inside led to two reception areas, one for men and one for women."
13342,charge,“what’s your charge?” she asked.
13343,evin,"“i’ve never heard of someone being brought to evin for christianity,” she said suspiciously."
13344,charge,“your charge is participating in political activities against the government.” we said nothing.
13345,arrest,"we later learned that the official charges were “acting against state security” and “taking part in illegal gatherings.” they couldn’t legally arrest us just for being christians, according to article 23 of the iranian constitution: “the investigation of individuals’ beliefs is forbidden, and no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief.” news of this constitutional guarantee would have come as quite a shock to many of the country’s policemen and law enforcement organizations, not to mention its citizens."
13346,ordered,she searched us and ordered us each to put on one of the filthy chadors.
13347,law,"it would be haraam—sinful—according to islamic law, for him to touch the bare skin of a woman he didn’t know."
13348,murder,(the long list of haraam offenses includes everything from murder and premarital sex to eating pork or getting a tattoo.)
13349,taken,"with our hands blackened by the ink, we had our photos taken again."
13350,crimes,"someone entered our names and information about our “crimes” into a computer, which spit out white identification cards for each of us."
13351,prisoners,we were now officially prisoners of the islamic republic of iran.
13352,guard,"a guard led us out a back door into the main prison yard, which was huge and covered with so many red brick buildings it looked like a town."
13353,guard,"our guard rang a bell, gave our cards to the young woman who opened the door, and left."
13354,where,"we were called one at a time into a small room, where we had to strip naked and submit to the indignity of a full body search."
13355,ordered,they ordered us to squat and stand three times.
13356,prisoners,"though the women who searched us looked and acted like guards, they were actually prisoners."
13357,inmates,"as we soon learned, the inmates did most of the work inside evin, which made life easier for the guards and staff and gave certain prisoners the chance to earn special favors."
13358,cell,"after we dressed, we were led up a long flight of stairs to an office outside the cell block, where women prisoners were coming and going."
13359,parole,some were leaving with their luggage for a new year’s holiday parole with their families.
13360,arrested,"“we are christians and we promoted our faith, so we were arrested for activities against the regime.” “why did you do such things to yourselves?” she asked in a gruff voice."
13361,ward,another guard led us to ward 2.
13362,locked,"“ask for mrs. mahjoob,” the guard instructed as she locked the door behind us."
13363,prisoner,"she was the prisoner in charge of ward 2, keeping order among the inmates and acting as a point of contact between prisoners and prison staff."
13364,ward,ward 1 was for drug offenders.
13365,prisoners,"ward 3 was for prisoners with mental problems—and as the newest and cleanest part of the women’s prison, was  usually the only part shown to visiting inspectors or other outsiders."
13366,state,ward 2 was for everyone else and was divided into two parts: women accused of murder or prostitution were downstairs; women charged with fraud or crimes against the state were upstairs.
13367,charged,“what have you been charged with?” mrs. mahjoob asked.
13368,ward,“come over to this room until i decide where to put you.” there were six cells upstairs in ward 2.
13369,prisoners,"under the lowest bunk in each set were three or four wicker baskets, one for each person in the room, the only personal storage space the prisoners had."
13370,prisoners,"still others were coming and going to “the shop,” a tiny window down the hall where prisoners bought supplies, snacks, and little luxuries from the prison commissary."
13371,charges,"as newcomers, we were showered with questions about our lives and the charges against us."
13372,charges,"“you have become apostates,” one woman said harshly after we told her our charges."
13373,prisoners,"newcomers always cry for an hour before they settle down.” another woman shouted back, “political prisoners don’t cry, because we haven’t done anything wrong!” “don’t worry,” the woman who had mentioned crying said, “we’re all political prisoners in this room.” she introduced herself as tahereh."
13374,arrested,she and eighteen others had been arrested on their way to visit their children in iraq.
13375,camp,"their children lived in ashraf city, a mujahideen refugee camp near baghdad that had been under us control but had recently been handed over to the iraqi government."
13376,arrested,they were arrested at the airport and brought to prison.
13377,arrest,it was the first we’d had since our arrest.
13378,inmates,the mujahideen women were the most welcoming and generous of all the inmates we met that day.
13379,where,"other women gave us shampoo, towels, and combs, and a woman named sepideh led us to the bathroom, where several women were washing dishes in the sink."
13380,wall,“all the other rooms are too full.” we found space to sit on the floor in front of a plastic shoe rack along one wall.
13381,ward,"the door at the entrance to ward 2 was locked, but women could move freely among the six cells, the bathroom, and a small room with four telephones and the little window for commissary purchases."
13382,inmates,"we hadn’t received them yet, so we’d have to make do with whatever the prison gave us until the holidays were over, along with any help our fellow inmates might offer."
13383,prisoners,"a loudspeaker crackled with the names of several prisoners, who jumped up to report to the office."
13384,court,taken to court?
13385,executed,executed?
13386,inmate,"every inmate both loved and dreaded hearing her name called—loved it because of the hope that she would be released from evin prison, dreaded it because the news could also be devastating."
13387,case,"in this case, all the women called learned they were to be set free."
13388,crime,“what is their crime?” “converting to christianity.” “that isn’t a crime!
13389,arrested,"when the check bounced, she was arrested."
13390,parole,"she missed her two children and had thought she would be granted new year’s parole to see them, but her request was denied."
13391,justice,i’m angry with this god who does not command any justice.
13392,inmate,"in addition to mrs. mahjoob, who was in charge of all of ward 2, each room had an inmate leader who assigned sleeping space, settled arguments, reported problems to the guards, and collected and served food for that room."
13393,ward,"“you brought luck to the ward,” she said."
13394,charged,"when another man claimed the property was legally his, this woman was charged with trying to sell something she didn’t own and sent to prison."
13395,term,"she called us her daughters and asked us to call her “mommy.” after dinner, she gave us the rundown on all the long-term residents of our room."
13396,authorities,had the authorities sent her to get the names of our christian friends?
13397,ward,"ward 2 had surveillance cameras in the ceiling of every room, including the toilets."
13398,police,"in june 2008, the security police came to my apartment in tehran and took me to a hotel for questioning."
13399,police,"“after spending the rest of the day answering questions, i asked the police if i could attend a friend’s wedding later in the evening."
13400,confinement,"so that night, instead of celebrating with my friend, i was brought here to evin prison.” she went through intense interrogation the first few days and was kept in solitary confinement."
13401,ward,"but it wasn’t true and i refused to say it.” three weeks ago, she had been transferred to ward 2 and was now very happy to meet two christian girls."
13402,cell,"around that time, the lights were turned off, except for a small spotlight in each cell, though the individual rooms were not locked."
13403,freed,"after midnight, a group of mujahideen women were released, which freed up some additional bunks in our room."
13404,evin,"“most people have to sleep on the floor for the first week or so.” after sleeping on the floor at vozara for the past fourteen days, even a thin and dirty mattress in evin prison felt like a cloud."
13405,inmate,each inmate was allowed to use the phone once a day.
13406,prisoners,"established prisoners received more minutes than new arrivals, and those with longer sentences got more time than the rest."
13407,inmates,"prisoners could sell their time to other inmates, usually for snacks from the commissary."
13408,inmates,"mrs. imani spent every moment possible on the phone every day, trading for some of the time, badgering inmates out of more, and simply taking it whenever she saw a chance."
13409,toilet,"because she had a hard time walking, we washed her dishes for her and helped her to the toilet."
13410,imprisoned,"later that morning, we had a long talk with sanaz, the woman imprisoned for her brother’s bad check."
13411,where,"as time for the new year’s celebration approached, we went back to our room, where a crowd was gathered around a small tv set waiting for the festivities to begin."
13412,wall,it’s hard to celebrate when a prison wall separates you from the people you love.
13413,inmates,"many inmates tried to observe the nowruz tradition of haft seen, setting the new year’s banquet table with seven items beginning with the farsi letter s, symbolizing the various parts of creation: a mirror, representing the sky; an apple, representing the earth; candles,  representing fire; rose water, representing water; grain, representing plants; goldfish, representing animals; painted eggs, representing humankind and fertility."
13414,inmates,"inmates displayed their haft seen, one per room, in little piles on the floor or on the beds."
13415,evin,"will you pray for me, too?” evin prison, the dreaded hellhole of tehran and symbol of radical islamic oppression, had become our church."
13416,inmate,"she was eager to share personal tidbits about everyone, but the resident in room 3 triggered a reaction like no other inmate."
13417,charges,mommy told us the woman’s name was soraya and that she had been in prison for eight years on fraud charges.
13418,toilet,"because of her size, she could not get on and off the toilet, so instead she used one of the showers to relieve herself."
13419,prisoners,mrs. mahjoob explained that room 4 of ward 2 was for prisoners who were mothers of young children.
13420,cell,the children lived in the cell with them.
13421,imprisoned,"maryam and i went with mrs. mahjoob to room 4 to meet the boy’s mother, a very tall, slender afghan woman, imprisoned on drug charges."
13422,locked,"his mother was another tall afghan, locked away on drug charges."
13423,taken,she was depressed because soon her son would be taken from her.
13424,authorities,"children could live in the prison only until they were three years old; after that, they were separated from their mothers by the authorities and sent to an orphanage if no other family members were available."
13425,sentenced,she stabbed him to death in self-defense and was sentenced to life in prison for murder.
13426,inmates,"she was a drug addict who, like several other inmates, earned pocket money and extra food by cleaning the toilets in ward 2."
13427,evin,"like every other rule at evin, the rule about mothers with children living in room 4 was not strictly observed."
13428,where,"a curly-headed girl named kasra was the daughter of a woman who lived downstairs, where the cells were darker, dirtier, and thick with cigarette smoke."
13429,jail,"kasra’s mother was a beautiful, aggressive lesbian, whose young lover, vida, was known as “the jail child” because she had been born in prison and had lived most of her life there."
13430,crime,"vida had no family on the outside, so every time she was released, she committed a crime in order to return to the only real home she’d ever known."
13431,ward,these two were known as bullies in ward 2.
13432,evin,"though outright violence was under control at evin, homosexuality remained a powerful and ever-present force."
13433,detention,"since we had first come into the vozara detention center, we’d seen lesbian behavior in some form every day and felt the tension it brought to a roomful of women locked up together."
13434,situation,"the situation at evin prison was as bad or worse—taunting words, suggestive movements, and open expressions of physical love were so common that they were taken for granted."
13435,charges,they had been in prison for two years on drug charges and lived downstairs.
13436,prisoners,"during the holidays, maryam and i went downstairs to exercise in the little courtyard, where we mixed with the ward 2 prisoners from the lower floor."
13437,exercise,"there were a few pieces of broken-down exercise equipment in one corner, just for show."
13438,prisoners,"one lone tree added a touch of life and greenery to the scene, but during our stay in evin the guards made one of the prisoners cut it down."
13439,inmates,one of the long-term inmates was able to borrow a cd player so we could have music for dancing.
13440,executed,“that means you are an apostate and you will be executed.
13441,charges,"samaneh and sima, both in prison on murder charges, were the most notorious couple at evin."
13442,arrested,her case had been a big story on tv and in the newspapers when she was arrested eight years before.
13443,law,"he and sima established a sigheh, a temporary marriage contract under islamic law, which allowed them to have sex, because islam permits men to have up to four wives."
13444,case,"according to the rumors flying around her case, sima killed her lover’s wife when the lover was out of town."
13445,death,"sima, it was said, sneaked into their house with a key he had given her, waited in the basement for the children to leave for school, and stabbed the wife to death."
13446,charges,sima denied the charges and was still fighting them after eight years in prison.
13447,inmate,"during that time, her celebrity and personality had made her the most powerful inmate—the boss of bosses—in the women’s prison at evin."
13448,prisoners,other prisoners hated her because she treated them so scornfully and because she turned them in for rules violations in order to enhance her position with the staff.
13449,executed,they could hardly wait for her to be executed.
13450,inmates,"when she was in charge of frisking prisoners for drugs, some inmates said she took the job to extremes, putting her finger inside their bodies or making them relieve themselves in front of her to ensure there were no drugs hidden in the most private of places."
13451,executed,at least two women had been executed after she set them up.
13452,execution,"this made her a favorite with the warden, and sima hoped it would extend her stay of execution."
13453,death,"it was very sad to see how life in prison had made her willing to do anything to survive, even sending other women to their death."
13454,law,"under islamic law, he could legally satisfy his lust with her."
13455,crime,"if she did murder the man’s wife, it was a terrible crime."
13456,crime,but what made the crime possible?
13457,law,a law that allows men unlimited freedom to play out their sexual fantasies with women who are nothing but toys to them.
13458,prisoner,"for every hard-hearted prisoner like sima, there were many who were kind and friendly to us."
13459,bail,"she was offered bail, but the only way she could get the money was if her mother mortgaged her apartment, which she refused to do."
13460,locked,arezoo had been locked up for two years.
13461,where,"she told us she had signed checks for the steel company where she worked, not knowing the checks were worthless."
13462,evin,"after creditors accused her of being an accomplice in an embezzlement scheme, she was sent to evin."
13463,camp,her husband was living at the ashraf mujahideen camp in iraq.
13464,prisoner,her brother was a prisoner at evin and had survived intensive interrogations in ward 209.
13465,cell,"sepideh had been in 209, too, and shared a cell there with silva, the kind christian woman who had introduced herself to us on new year’s day."
13466,prisoner,"another prisoner in ward 209 with them was shirin alam hooli, a member of the kurdish opposition group known as pjak."
13467,inside,"i told her about christ coming into my heart, changing me from the inside out, and about his love and sacrifice for humankind."
13468,evin,"after about a week at evin, i saw shirin alam hooli, a slim young woman with shoulderlength hair, alone in the courtyard."
13469,state,"“yes,” i said, “i did promote and advocate christianity, especially among young people.” as we walked in the courtyard, shirin told me the story of how she had become involved with the kurdish nationalist group known as pjak (partiya jiyana azad a kurdistanê), or free life party of kurdistan, which seeks to establish political rights for kurds in iran and create an autonomous kurdish state."
13470,arrested,"in 2008, she was arrested by the sepah corps in the shahrak-e gharb district of western tehran on charges of carrying explosives and being a member of pjak."
13471,guard,"the sepah corps are the most ruthless soldiers in the revolutionary guard, cruel murderers assigned to protect the islamic system of iran from internal enemies."
13472,prisoners,"they took shirin to ward 240, where political prisoners arrested by the guard go for special interrogation."
13473,wall,they banged her head against the wall over and over.
13474,tortured,one of the guards who tortured her washed his hands as ablution before prayers and said that what he was about to do to her was a holy act for the sake of god.
13475,ward,"during that time, she was transferred to ward 209."
13476,poverty,she spoke of the terrible poverty and restrictions imposed on kurdish girls and said that her greatest wish was to be able to help them somehow.
13477,malnutrition,"her hair was thinning, her face and skin were dry, and her eyes were failing because of malnutrition."
13478,justice,"after hearing shirin’s story, marziyeh said to me, “we must learn from shirin how to struggle for justice."
13479,crime,"i raised all my brothers and sisters.” it was almost impossible to watch her play with such tenderness and compassion and know she had been tortured for days on end for the crime of moharebeh, fighting against god."
13480,arrest,"“sure enough, they had a reason to arrest you!"
13481,toilet,"we had started helping her go to the toilet, doing little chores for her, and helping her go into the hall when the clinic worker came to give her an insulin shot—even though the guard yelled at us for being there when we didn’t need treatment."
13482,serving,we had started serving her food out of compassion and courtesy; now she expected it.
13483,evin,the food in evin prison was awful.
13484,prisoners,"once a week we had sausage, which was horrible and gave many of the prisoners diarrhea every time they ate it."
13485,inmates,"the food was also laced with formaldehyde, which was supposed to suppress the inmates’ sex drive."
13486,evin,and we soon learned that the medical care in evin prison was every bit as bad as the cooking.
13487,detention,"chapter 9 feeding the hungry maryam by the time we transferred to evin, we had already spent two weeks in detention at vozara without a decent meal or a bath."
13488,prisoner,"when i told mrs. mahjoob, the prisoner in charge of ward 2, that marziyeh needed to see a doctor, she said he was on vacation for nowruz and wouldn’t be back until after the holidays."
13489,prisoners,"marziyeh stayed in bed for nearly a week, miserable, shivering, and exhausted, relieved only by the tea or fruit juice other prisoners brought her once in a while and a few bootleg painkillers."
13490,prisoners,"the springs on all the beds were completely shot, so most prisoners used two of their three blankets as a mattress pad and the third to sleep under."
13491,prisoner,"but if she gave up her bed, another prisoner would immediately claim it and it could be weeks before she had a bed again."
13492,prisoners,"i pressed the prison office for medical care, as did some other prisoners who were sick, but the answer was always the same: “the doctor is gone for the holidays."
13493,ward,"there’s nothing we can do.” between the crowded conditions, lesbian drama, constant petty squabbling, and mrs. imani screaming about the telephone, ward 2 was a noisy place, making it even harder for sick patients to rest."
13494,prisoners,"the political prisoners were always the quietest, calmest, most polite members of the ward."
13495,inmates,many spent the day knitting—the one productive pastime inmates were allowed.
13496,prisoners,"the courts were still closed for new year’s, which meant that few prisoners entered or left evin."
13497,charges,mrs. azam had been in prison for nearly three years on charges of acting against national security by joining a rally in support of women’s rights.
13498,evin,mrs. mahdieh was very interested in how women were treated at evin.
13499,detention,"i explained about our arrest, detention at vozara, and transfer to evin."
13500,where,“then where is the true bible?” mrs. mahdieh wondered.
13501,where,“where can i find one?” i wrote down the address of a church.
13502,power,"it was interesting that this woman thought our prayers had power, even though we’d never spoken to her."
13503,evin,"since our arrival at evin, marziyeh and i had not been allowed to use the telephone."
13504,prisoner,a prisoner named emma was in charge of scheduling telephone slots.
13505,prisoners,"when we asked for telephone time, we learned that other prisoners had been using our time and didn’t want to turn it over to us."
13506,prisoners,the call time allotment was something the prisoners worked out on their own; the prison didn’t officially hand out telephone minutes.
13507,inmates,the long-term inmates had come up with this  system to give them control of the phones and ensure themselves the time they wanted.
13508,question,"we had scarcely finished our question when she brushed past us, walked into room 2, and whispered something to a heavyset woman who was knitting a scarf."
13509,prisoners,“you stupid political prisoners!” she hollered.
13510,prisoners,"we had worked hard to get along with the other prisoners, even when it meant giving up little privileges such as a good place in line at the shop window or a bigger serving of potatoes and eggs, the one meal a week we would eat."
13511,charges,she had been in prison for eight years on fraud charges and would not be released until she repaid her creditors.
13512,locked,"her debt was so large that she could never repay it from prison, which meant she would likely be locked up for the rest of her life."
13513,notorious,"she was notorious for her prickly attitude, especially toward newcomers, in order to show them she was in charge."
13514,ward,"when she met us, the first thing she said, with mock seriousness, was, “oh my god, more christians in this ward?"
13515,evin,"naseem, also in room 2, was the person who had frisked me so rudely when we transferred to evin."
13516,murdering,"though she was accused of murdering her mother-in-law, as we got to know her we found she was a kind and gentle woman."
13517,question,did you think i could lay eggs like a chicken?” that question drew a laugh from everyone who heard it.
13518,crime,"she had been in prison for eight months on murder charges, even though her husband had committed the crime."
13519,arrested,"a few minutes later, the police arrived and arrested them both."
13520,convicted,"if pouneh’s husband were convicted alone, he would be executed."
13521,convicted,"if they were convicted together, they would get life in prison."
13522,lawyer,i can’t even hire a lawyer to defend my rights.
13523,transferred,"how on earth can i spend the rest of my life in prison with my child?” she left in tears, headed back inside with the rest of the “murderers.” when the baby was born, pouneh would be transferred upstairs with the other mothers."
13524,prisoner,"another prisoner, mana, was only twenty-three, but it was hard to tell because she wore so much makeup that she looked like a clown."
13525,prisoners,"though wearing makeup was against prison rules, mana and some other prisoners wore it at night after dinner when the guards seldom came around."
13526,inmates,mana was one of the inmates who scheduled telephone time for ward 2.
13527,inmates,"unfortunately, the other inmates took advantage of her naiveté and cheated on their calls."
13528,law,"years ago, i actually tore up a copy of the koran and set it on fire.” (this is a terrible sin under islamic law."
13529,authorities,the authorities gave us his body without explaining how he died.
13530,death,"i was young at the time, and his death was a terrible blow."
13531,parole,"their plan was to get out on parole, retrieve the money from its hiding place, and flee the country for a life of leisure abroad."
13532,death,she saw it as a way to avenge her father’s death.
13533,prisoners,our fellow prisoners were hungry for the truth.
13534,punishment,the guilty ones felt the weight of sin for their crimes and believed islam condemned them to punishment or death.
13535,inmates,"at the same time, the truth of jesus, his love for sinners, and his atonement for their sins, was a miracle to these inmates, a balm for even the oldest and most painful wounds  in their souls."
13536,retribution,"most of these women had lost all hope of salvation because of islam’s depiction of god as a god of retribution and revenge, a god who demanded impossible standards and had no mercy on those who failed to achieve them."
13537,prisoner,"mrs. mahjoob said that some prisoner who was gone must have forgotten about it and left it, and i should just throw it away."
13538,case,"as i carried the box to the trash, i looked through it, just in case."
13539,prisoners,"“now you can read a portion of the authentic bible you’ve always wanted.” as word got around, many, many prisoners wanted to read it."
13540,injustice,why is he silent in the face of so much injustice?
13541,freedom,"we envied the birds their freedom, their ability to see the whole sky instead of the little square visible to us."
13542,prisoners,"chapter 10 a nasty reputation maryam on the thirteenth and final day of nowruz, known as sizdah bedar, the prisoners were allowed to spend the whole day outside, visiting, dancing, drinking tea, and savoring the final hours before the normal prison routine resumed."
13543,prisoners,"there were prisoners who danced beautifully with graceful, artistic moves, while others pulsed and gyrated to the pounding beat of hip-hop music."
13544,guard,"at 6:30, a guard’s voice, badly distorted and incredibly loud, boomed over the loudspeaker, ordering everyone into the courtyard."
13545,prisoners,register time!” this was the mandatory headcount of all prisoners taken every morning and again at 7:00 p.m. every night.
13546,prisoners,some prejudiced guards forced prisoners to pray omalyajib islamic prayers.
13547,ordered,"“swear to god that mohammed is the prophet of god,” they ordered."
13548,prisoner,"at last, one of the guards and mrs. alipour, a prisoner who worked downstairs, came out to do the job."
13549,ward,we turned and started back toward the ward.
13550,where,"the only quiet place was at the very front of the line, where soraya’s gigantic bulk nearly blocked the view of the window for everyone else."
13551,power,"we prayed that god would always give us the power to forgive and a sense of compassion for everyone, even those who mistreated us."
13552,trial,we learned by trial and error which items were worth buying.
13553,prisoners,we bought a supply of chocolate and the best snacks to give away to the poorest prisoners who couldn’t buy anything.
13554,prisoners,"many of the prisoners in our ward went back to bed for a couple of hours after roll call, then had their breakfast and went to the cultural center."
13555,arrest,"the cultural center was the cleanest, roomiest place we had seen since our arrest."
13556,inmates,"the prison authorities portrayed the cultural center to the outside world as one of their strong points: a place where inmates got healthy exercise, expressed themselves artistically, and were instructed in the muslim faith."
13557,prisoner,"marziyeh, who is a good table tennis player, started a game with another prisoner."
13558,charge,"when the woman in charge saw how well marziyeh could play, she invited her to compete in an upcoming tournament."
13559,charges,“are you really here on charges of believing in jesus christ?” the teacher asked.
13560,state,"my friend and i converted to christianity and have been charged with acting against the state.” “what’s wrong with islam?” after i shared my conversion story, i asked the teacher if she’d ever read the bible."
13561,charges,one of the women in the office asked me what the charges were against us.
13562,charged,"“we are charged with following jesus and promoting christianity,” i said."
13563,prisoners,"“aren’t all prisoners allowed to use the cultural center, regardless of their charges?” i asked."
13564,executed,"in fact, hell-bound infidels like you must be executed!” “i’ve done nothing wrong,” i declared."
13565,charges,“i have no reason to be ashamed of my charges.
13566,wall,"in fact, i’m proud of them.” as i turned to go, i saw a quotation written on the wall: “blessed are those who are rejected by their fellow human beings, but not by their god.” the lord was speaking to me even then, reminding me of his love."
13567,parole,"our friend silva wanted to help us, but she was waiting for parole, so we encouraged her not to stir up trouble with the authorities."
13568,charge,"when mrs. pari, the woman in charge of our room, went to the cultural center manager to speak for us, mrs. ghanbari angrily told her, “those girls are apostates."
13569,executed,they must be executed because their presence corrupts the others.
13570,confinement,at least they should be in solitary confinement.” hearing the word executed was startling.
13571,executed,could we really be executed?
13572,charges,"we hadn’t even seen the formal, written charges against us."
13573,custody,"after six weeks in custody, we had not yet been allowed to speak with a lawyer."
13574,ward,"on the other hand, our many friends in the ward became bolder about their friendships with us."
13575,arrested,"mrs. pari was more worried, though, about what would happen if her daughter were arrested."
13576,arrest,"though we had sometimes shaded the truth since our arrest to protect our christian friends, we would never deny our faith to save ourselves."
13577,arrested,"when we were first arrested, all we could think about was getting out."
13578,where,"now, we were comfortable in the place where god had sent us."
13579,inmates,the most important topics were always prison conditions and the status of various inmates.
13580,inmates,"with the courts back in session, new inmates arrived every day."
13581,evin,no visitors had been allowed at evin prison during the holidays.
13582,transferred,now at last we would have the chance to see our sisters for the first time since we’d transferred from vozara.
13583,prisoner,"by law, each prisoner was allowed a noncontact visit every week, and one contact visit per month, when we could hug and touch our visitors."
13584,inmates,"in practice, the head of the women’s prison, mrs. rezaei, and the prison staff reserved contact visits for their friends, and in exchange for bribes from other inmates."
13585,inmate,"contact visits were very important because they were an inmate’s only physical contact with the outside world, and it was when friends could smuggle in food, fresh clothing, and other contraband."
13586,guard,"after roll call and breakfast, a guard called the names of everyone who had visitors."
13587,building,"we waited an hour for the small, dirty minibus that took us across the prison complex to the visitors’ building."
13588,evin,visitors must think evin is a beautiful place.
13589,inside,we went inside and down a long staircase into the basement.
13590,prisoners,"family members were already seated, so prisoners rushed in like a herd of buffalo to find their visitors as quickly as possible because we only had ten minutes."
13591,lawyer,"for the first time, we heard that our sisters had asked mr. soltani to be our lawyer."
13592,evin,"he had been to evin prison twice already to have us sign the form, but was not allowed to see us."
13593,law,"mr. sobhani refused, saying it was against the law for him to deny our lawyer permission to see us so of course he couldn’t write it down."
13594,bail,"there was still the matter of the bail he had set for each of us: two hundred million tomans (about $100,000)."
13595,trial,"miraculously, our sisters had been able to secure mortgages on family property and were seeking to have us released until our trial."
13596,bail,"when mr. sobhani learned they had come up with the bail, he insisted he had never authorized bail in our case and refused to accept it."
13597,lawyer,"after our visit, we talked with two friends who worked in the prison advisory services office about getting permission to see our lawyer."
13598,prisoner,"in most political cases, and in a few rare unusual cases like yours, our office isn’t allowed to help the prisoner.” it was a fresh reminder that what happened to us was in god’s hands alone."
13599,inmates,"the three of us formed what we called “our community.” each day, we spent the morning together praying for the inmates, for ourselves, and for a renewed vision of how to serve god better while we were in prison."
13600,ward,our fasting created a sensation in the ward.
13601,ward,"on easter day, the whole ward congratulated us."
13602,taken,"during a contact visit after she had taken easter communion at church, she brought silva bread dipped in wine at the communion rail to share with us."
13603,inside,it is impossible to put into words the feeling of taking communion secretly together inside an iranian prison.
13604,prisoners,it encouraged prisoners who had been hesitant to reach out to us before to make contact.
13605,bail,"he could forgive me, or at least pay my bail so i could be with my daughter, but he wants to keep the pressure on my husband to pay the entire debt."
13606,arrested,"a friend of mine in prison told me about you and said i should ask you to pray for me.” her friend was ziba, a woman we knew who lived downstairs because she’d been arrested on prostitution charges, but who worked upstairs on our floor during the day."
13607,police,"one day, the police raided the apartment."
13608,bail,she had now been in prison for three months and had no way to raise bail.
13609,bail,"he offered to pay her bail in exchange for sexual favors in a sigheh, the islamic temporary marriage."
13610,situation,"“i feel completely hopeless.” “if you repent and have faith, god will help you out of this situation,” marziyeh assured her."
13611,bail,"to get god’s pardon, he has offered to put down a deed to property as bail so i can get out and see my child."
13612,prisoners,"soon after easter, mrs. imani, the woman who seemed so crazy and was always desperate to use the telephone, gave us new evidence of what many prisoners really thought about islam."
13613,inmates,she was one of the extremely pious inmates who seemed to despise us for being christians.
13614,suspect,"now, mrs. imani was beginning to suspect that what she’d heard about christianity was not true, and she asked us for some real answers."
13615,case,"“i thought this might be the case,” she admitted."
13616,inmates,"it was clear that inmates who seemed to be fanatical believers—praying, reading the koran, and fingering their beads for hours on end—did so not necessarily because they believed any of it, but to gain favor with the prison officials."
13617,inmates,"there were many inmates like mrs. imani who found islam to be empty and false, but pretended to follow it in order to make their lives a little easier and to reduce pressure on their family, contacts, and social position on the outside."
13618,evin,that kind of religious charade doesn’t happen only inside evin prison.
13619,prisoners,many of the prisoners went through the motions of islam because they felt they had no choice.
13620,power,"yet every day we saw the power of christ at work, drawing these broken, frightened, sinful people to himself with a message of hope, strength, and forgiveness."
13621,prisoners,"more important, the prisoners felt his power too."
13622,prisoner,"chapter 11 willing spirit, weary flesh marziyeh there was a prisoner downstairs named mercedeh, a rough-looking character whose arms were covered with knife scars."
13623,locked,i’ve been locked up for six weeks on a charge of believing in jesus.
13624,robbery,"can you tell me something about yourself?” as mercedeh was telling me that she had been in prison a year and a half for armed robbery, another woman walked up behind her and interrupted, shouting, “who are you talking to?” she leaned toward the window and said sharply to me, “who has allowed you to talk to this girl?” then she pulled mercedeh away from the window and slammed the shutters closed."
13625,abuse,"setare was in her early twenties and had hair down to her waist, and her once attractive face had been ravaged by years of drug abuse."
13626,criminal,we got caught stripping cars for money to feed our habit.” “why don’t you quit doing that and get a regular job?” “who’s going to hire a drug-addicted criminal like me?
13627,where,"where is god in all this?” “my dear setare, god hears you right now in the depth of your misery."
13628,evin,“are you saying god can hear my cries and help me right now?” “of course he can.” i told her the story of my own faith journey and the circumstances that had brought maryam and me to evin.
13629,charged,"she was charged with armed robbery, and her victim had demanded eight million tomans (about $4,000) compensation, which she could never pay."
13630,tortured,she had been tortured and her mouth smashed.
13631,arrested,"her arrival had made headlines: “girl behind multi-million tomans robbery arrested.” to pay for their shishe habit, she and a friend had dressed in provocative clothes and stood at a busy intersection asking for rides in luxurious cars."
13632,robbery,"after mercedeh was captured, the prison guards had tortured her to reveal the names of her robbery victims."
13633,inmates,"while spiritually we were strong and fulfilled, physically we suffered along with the rest of our fellow inmates."
13634,exercise,"the filth, bad food, poor medical care, and lack of exercise and fresh air in prison made it practically impossible to stay healthy."
13635,prisoners,"prisoners saw their hair become thin and brittle from malnutrition, like shirin alam hooli’s had done; their skin, eyesight, strength, and ability to sleep were all degraded by the conditions."
13636,evin,maryam and i both felt ill during much of our time at evin.
13637,building,"several times, i visited the clinic, in another building across the prison yard from the women’s prison."
13638,ward,there i saw addicts from ward 1 for the first time.
13639,crime,"they could get their fix more easily inside the prison, because the prison officials readily sold drugs supplied by the same organized crime group that controlled sales at the prison shop."
13640,hole,"in the dream, my right hand had a hole in it from the nail, and i heard jesus say to me, “i have let you taste a little of my suffering.” when i awoke, i thanked god for the strength to survive in prison, even though i saw myself as weak and disabled."
13641,ward,it all started when a serious virus spread throughout ward 2.
13642,inmates,"because she was so unpopular, none of the other inmates wanted to risk catching the disease by taking care of her."
13643,where,"within a few days, the agony of her earache drove maryam to bed, where she wrapped the covers around her head to try to reduce the pain."
13644,prisoners,there’s nothing wrong with her.” i pleaded with the guards for hours until they finally relented—which they did mostly to silence me and the other prisoners who were arguing on maryam’s behalf.
13645,guard,"when another guard came to escort maryam to the clinic, he said harshly, “you could have waited a few days."
13646,prisoner,"you wouldn’t have died.” he turned her over to a female prisoner who worked in the office, with orders to take her to the clinic."
13647,ward,"once again, the clinic was full of drug addicts from ward 1."
13648,charged,"the doctor took her blood pressure, and before asking any medical questions, asked, “what are you charged with?” maryam could sometimes hear a little and was able to figure out what the doctor was saying."
13649,crime,“i’m here because i believe in jesus christ.” “is that a crime?
13650,crime,"converting is a crime.” “yes, and a very dangerous one.” dr. avesta shook her head."
13651,sentence,"“if you are an apostate, your sentence will be heavy.” after maryam described her symptoms, dr. avesta gave her some erythromycin, an antibiotic useless for treating a virus and which no sensible doctor would prescribe."
13652,inmates,"maryam started taking it, and also took some pain pills that other inmates gave her."
13653,where,"i helped her to the toilet, where she knelt on the floor and vomited for hours."
13654,ward,"others in the ward called for the guards, who looked at maryam through the bars without opening the door."
13655,ward,"your eardrum will heal itself.” with that, maryam was brought back to the ward."
13656,prisoners,"as soon as we felt well enough, we resumed praying for other prisoners."
13657,prisoners,"new prisoners, strangers to us, approached us regularly now."
13658,crime,"“praying is not a crime,” i said."
13659,imprisoned,"that’s their choice.” marziyeh and i had both prayed often for shahin, the secret christian who’d been imprisoned for owing her brother money."
13660,charges,"we had told her she should forgive her brother for bringing charges against her, just as christ had forgiven her for her sins."
13661,bail,"if her husband promised to pay the debt, her brother would pay shahin’s bail immediately."
13662,situation,what had seemed a hopeless situation was miraculously transformed in a single day.
13663,prisoners,"usually, prisoners were excited to hear their names on the loudspeaker, because it meant they were being released, or that at least their case was moving forward."
13664,court,"at the same time, it could be a sign of something bad, such as a trip to court for sentencing."
13665,arrest,"six weeks after our arrest, we heard our names on the loudspeaker at evin prison."
13666,ordered,our dear friends silva and shirin came into our room at once to ask if we knew why we were being ordered to report to the prison office.
13667,ward,"a woman behind the desk said, “you are being transferred to ward 209."
13668,guard,"you will go downstairs and wait for a guard to escort you.” just like that—no warning, no explanation."
13669,prisoners,"without ever seeing the charges against us in writing or speaking to a lawyer, we were being sent to the dreaded 209, the section set aside for political prisoners, where silva had been kept in solitary confinement for eight months and where shirin had been beaten unconscious and had her teeth knocked out."
13670,ward,"we went back to the ward to say a quick good-bye to silva, shirin, and the others we had come to love so much."
13671,ward,"the news of our transfer stirred up memories of their own awful experiences in ward 209, and they were terrified for us."
13672,guard,"after half an hour, a rotund, bearded, middle-aged guard appeared and barked, “wear your hijab properly and follow me.” the hijab is the islamic head scarf that must hide every strand of a woman’s hair in public."
13673,authority,there was nothing wrong with the way we were wearing ours; he only wanted to show off his authority.
13674,building,we walked behind him for a hundred yards or so until we came to a small white door in a red brick building.
13675,inside,he told us to wait and not to talk to each other; then he disappeared inside.
13676,ordered,"“put these on,” he ordered."
13677,inside,“look under the bottom of your blindfold and watch my feet.” we stumbled inside and heard the door lock behind us.
13678,wall,chapter 12 fairness and integrity marziyeh we followed the guard down a narrow hallway until he told us to stop and face the wall.
13679,ordered,"“don’t talk to each other,” he ordered."
13680,guard,"finally i whispered to maryam, “i can’t stand up anymore.” “who has permitted you to talk?” the guard demanded."
13681,ward,"compared to the noise of ward 2, this place was eerily quiet."
13682,guard,"the guard took us into separate little rooms, about six feet square."
13683,ward,"integrity”), an interrogator in ward 209 who had the same last name as the warden of the public part of evin prison."
13684,detention,"“you were in the vozara detention center for fourteen days, and now a month and a half in evin."
13685,taken,surely this has taken a toll on you.” i remained silent.
13686,arrested,"whether by our error or sheer bad luck, you were arrested by a rather extremist group."
13687,prisoners,i am with the ministry of intelligence and usually handle the cases of christian prisoners.
13688,case,"unfortunately, this extremist group has had your case file."
13689,case,we have been struggling and reasoning with them to turn your case over to us.
13690,evin,"“by the way, how are you getting along with the conditions at evin?"
13691,evin,"“i think you know about the conditions and problems at evin,” i said."
13692,ward,"that’s why i’m trying to have you sent here to ward 209, to conclude your case and have you released.” “what do you mean ‘unsuitable’?” i asked."
13693,criminals,"“there are many criminals over in the public side of the prison, and it isn’t appropriate for people like you to mingle with them.” “those criminals are also human beings,” i said."
13694,charges,"because the charges against us are so unusual here, their curiosity gets the best of them."
13695,evin,but i’ve learned more about iran and islam at evin prison than i could have learned in any university.
13696,where,"your bible says you must follow the laws of the country where you live.” “i don’t think you’ve read the bible correctly,” i said."
13697,law,"when the law of men and the law of christ differ, i follow christ.” “but miss amirizadeh, you don’t have the right to convert your fellow citizens to another faith."
13698,criminal,in an islamic state this is a criminal offense.” “the government tricked us with lies into coming to the police station.
13699,warrant,the basiji ransacked our apartment and took our belongings without a warrant.
13700,dictatorship,"these are the illegal acts of a dictatorship.” “miss amirizadeh,” mr. mosavat said with an icy tone, “you must understand: i am the law."
13701,law,"and no one should dare oppose this.” “if god showed his face to you today and said you must tell your people the truth, would you follow his order, or the law of iran?” i asked."
13702,case,"in any case, if you continue your activities here, it will be very hard for you.” “do what you wish,” i said."
13703,injustice,"“but i respect god’s will above my own, and i think his will has been for me to come into this prison to witness the suffering and injustice here."
13704,arrested,paul arrested and tortured christians on behalf of his government.
13705,repression,"one day, the lord appeared to him as a blinding light on the road to damascus and challenged his brutal acts of repression."
13706,wall,"blindfolded and facing the wall, i thought of all the women who had sat in this chair."
13707,where,it was probably where shirin had sat blindfolded when she was slapped until she was dizzy.
13708,arrested,"while i waited, i answered the long list of written questions, beginning with how i had been arrested and who had arrested me."
13709,arrested,"unfortunately, the people who arrested you are a fanatical group, and it has taken us this long to get your case and fight them on your behalf."
13710,case,"this is an intelligence case, not a security case."
13711,police,"rasti at the police station asked me the questions aloud and wrote down my answers himself,” i explained."
13712,situation,"this was the first time marziyeh or i had any idea that someone on the outside, other than our sisters and friends, knew about our situation."
13713,crime,"if my sister were in here and i were in her place, a tv interview is the least of what i would do.” “do you know that talking to foreign tv reporters is a crime?” mr. mosavat demanded sternly."
13714,arrested,be sure we would have arrested her already if we intended to do so.” suddenly he sounded concerned.
13715,ward,i had all the prison doctoring i want in ward 2.” “you sound upset.
13716,situation,tell us and we will investigate.” “you are totally aware of the situation there and at vozara—the malnutrition and mistreatment.
13717,prisoners,"the health and lives of prisoners are worthless to you—” “they are convicts,” mr. mosavat snapped, interrupting me, “and they should be treated as such!"
13718,prisoners,"you two, on the other hand, are distinguished ladies and shouldn’t be kept with prisoners."
13719,detention,"if we had known about your detention at vozara, we would have brought you here sooner."
13720,prisoners,"“i don’t want to know about other prisoners,” he continued."
13721,prisoners,"is there anything you want to report?” “first of all,” i said, “those ‘other prisoners’ are human beings."
13722,guilty,and they’re not all guilty.
13723,convicted,"you seem to have convicted them already in your mind, but most of those people shouldn’t be here at all."
13724,criminals,this oppressive culture has branded them as criminals for claiming the right to think as they please—the most basic human right.
13725,executed,"the head of the cultural center shouted at us, saying we weren’t allowed to use the center, that we were apostates and should be executed."
13726,prisoners,“how can someone who is poisoned not be taken to the clinic?” “eighty prisoners will say they witnessed it.” “we will definitely look into this.” mr. mosavat paused briefly.
13727,case,“i don’t know why your case has taken so long.
13728,ward,"we will transfer you both to ward 209 next week, though if you’re unhappy in ward 2, we can have you transferred tonight.” “thank you, but i’d rather stay with the ‘criminals’ over there."
13729,case,i’ll be studying your case file.
13730,police,i just received it from the police this morning.
13731,situation,we’ve been so busy with your situation that i can’t fall asleep at night for thinking about it.” i suppressed a laugh and only smiled beneath my blindfold.
13732,power,but we’ll do everything in our power to set you free as soon as possible.
13733,ward,we followed a guard across the yard to the women’s prison and ward 2.
13734,guard,"he told the guard there that we were to be sent to separate rooms and were not allowed to talk to each other, even during breaks."
13735,interrogation,"we were completely drained from the interrogation, both still suffering  from our sicknesses."
13736,punishment,mr. mosavat’s intended punishment opened the door to bring the gospel of christ to a whole new audience.
13737,ward,"while maryam was welcomed back to the ward by silva, shirin, and other friends, i had to get used to my new surroundings on the first floor."
13738,prisoners,"she has to stay here for a while, but if anything happens to her, we’ll know you are to blame.” after two years in prison, arezoo was not shy about speaking up, especially to people in authority who were prisoners themselves."
13739,prisoners,"prisoners on the second floor were generally better off financially, but were very selfish with their belongings."
13740,inmates,"downstairs, most of the inmates were very poor, yet they freely shared what they had."
13741,authorities,"the cells were darker and grimier than upstairs, and the women spoke only in whispers; yet it was a much warmer atmosphere of friendship and trust: no gossip, no betrayal to the authorities, only mutual help and support."
13742,prisoners,"during dinner the first night i was there, two prisoners got into a fight."
13743,charges,"we had long, meaningful conversations with them and answered countless questions about our charges and our own personal faith journeys."
13744,tortured,not since she was tortured.
13745,possession,we feel no sense of possession toward each other.
13746,murder,she had been in prison for three years on a murder charge.
13747,execution,"her aunt filed charges against her, demanding retribution by execution for her son’s death."
13748,law,"in iran, the law is in the hands of the aggrieved parties."
13749,offender,"they can choose to press charges, agree to some kind of compensation, or forgive the offender."
13750,law,this means there is no consistency or accountability in the law.
13751,justice,"the legal system in iran is based on revenge, not justice."
13752,imprisonment,she had never seen a lawyer during her three years of imprisonment because she couldn’t afford one.
13753,prisoner,"once an execution is ordered, the prisoner is taken into solitary confinement for her last night."
13754,execution,this is typically the first and only indication that an execution is about to be carried out.
13755,executed,"that was when we learned that zeynab had been executed by hanging shortly after midnight; her aunt had claimed the “honor” of pulling the chair out from under her, dropping her to her death."
13756,execution,the execution had to be carried out after midnight but before azan.
13757,jailed,mrs. niromand said she had told zeynab before she was hanged that the reason her mother had never come to see her was that she had died of a heart attack on the day zeynab was jailed.
13758,death,she said that zeynab welcomed death because it would reunite her with her mother.
13759,execution,it was the first execution of someone we knew.
13760,power,this was an act of injustice and evil beyond the power of expression.
13761,prisoner,"she had been a prisoner for years in a marriage that was a nightmare of abuse, forced to remain there by a law that holds a man’s sexual pleasure above the most basic rights of human decency and dignity for women."
13762,law,this is the law of the land.
13763,crime,"there was no investigation, no attempt to collect the facts, no consideration of the horrific circumstances that caused her to commit a crime accidentally and in self-defense."
13764,prisoners,"two days later, the prisoners held an islamic memorial service for zeynab, standing around her empty bed praying, the tears flowing freely."
13765,inmates,her friends handed out food to the poorest inmates as an act of charity in her memory.
13766,injustice,our hearts were broken for the tragic injustice of zeynab’s death.
13767,execution,zeynab’s barbaric execution brought the whole horror of the radical islamic regime into focus for us as never before.
13768,prisoners,anyone who says islam is a religion of peace and equality should spend a week with the prisoners of evin.
13769,abuse,denied any fair chance of escaping her abuse by legal means—in the islamic tradition.
13770,lawyer,"denied a lawyer, her life dependent on the whim of her husband’s angry relatives, who likely helped arrange the marriage in the first place—in the islamic tradition."
13771,killing,how savage the culture whose survival depends on abusing and killing helpless girls!
13772,ward,"chapter 13 blindfolded and blessed in ward 209 marziyeh after living on separate floors in ward 2 for a week, we were taken again to ward 209."
13773,inmates,"we didn’t know whether to expect more of the same treatment as full-time inmates, or if this was when our torture would begin."
13774,building,again we were led across the prison yard to a brick building with a small door.
13775,inside,we put on blindfolds and went inside.
13776,cell,"after shuffling down a hallway, peering out as best we could through the bottom of the blindfolds, we were ordered into a tiny cell about six feet square—the size of a closet."
13777,guard,"a guard told us to take off our blindfolds and all our clothes, and then gave us men’s prison uniforms that hung on us like sacks."
13778,ordered,“silence!” the guard ordered.
13779,wall,"when you have to go to the toilet, press this button on the wall and someone will come for you.” she left us to look around our new home, but there wasn’t much to see."
13780,sink,the only furniture was a small metal sink.
13781,ward,there wasn’t another sound anywhere —quite a change from the constant noise and commotion of ward 2.
13782,prisoners,shirin and silva had told us to pound on the walls to see if any other prisoners heard and answered back.
13783,cell,"in response to our pounding, the cell door opened and a young, heavyset guard stood glaring at us without a word."
13784,guard,“so this is what you do!” the guard said.
13785,guard,"sometime later, a tall, young guard, scarcely more than a girl, came in with plastic plates of food."
13786,arrest,"it was the first time since our arrest we’d had a good, hot meal served to us on plates."
13787,inmates,silva had told us that the guards in ward 209 feed the inmates better because they are political prisoners and news of their treatment is more likely to get out.
13788,justice,this made about as much sense as anything else in the iranian justice system.
13789,tortured,"if we were going to be tortured, at least we’d be well nourished."
13790,toilet,"when we awoke, we needed to use the toilet."
13791,guard,after a minute the older guard with glasses threw open our door.
13792,guard,"but the buzzer doesn’t work.” “it’s not a buzzer,” said the guard, exasperated."
13793,toilet,"except for breakfast at 7:00 a.m., our other meals, and trips to the toilet or the shower, our only activities were talking or sleeping."
13794,cell,"every two or three days, we had the chance to go on a break to a larger room with a clear skylight, but we turned it down in protest over our tiny, windowless cell and lack of books or other diversions."
13795,guard,"we made up nicknames for the guards based on our impressions of them: mommy, a kind, older woman who was the head guard and usually brought us our food; auntie, a short, fat, comicallooking woman; cousin, another chubby guard; iron woman, who had braces on her teeth; grumpy, who was always in a bad mood; and the ghost, who never spoke or made an unnecessary move."
13796,cell,"after a few days, we were transferred to another small cell, the same size as our old one, where we scarcely had room to lie down, but which we would now share with a third woman,  munis, who had been in ward 209 for three months."
13797,cellmate,"she and her former cellmate, roxana saberi, were the ones who had answered our knocks the day we arrived."
13798,sentenced,roxana was an iranian-american journalist falsely accused of espionage and sentenced to eight years in prison.
13799,captivity,"(she later wrote a book about her experience, between two worlds: my life and captivity in iran.)"
13800,prisoner,"later that day, a fourth prisoner was added to our cell, a girl of about sixteen with long black hair."
13801,confinement,"they had met earlier, but then had both been placed in solitary confinement."
13802,imprisoned,"the new girl’s name was mahtab, and she had been imprisoned for belonging to the mujahideen organization."
13803,arrested,she was arrested while walking in a park with her fiancé.
13804,evin,"she believed it was a way for the regime to harass her father, who had already spent a year at evin, leaving her mother and ten-year-old brother to fend for themselves."
13805,ward,"her father was in the public ward of the prison, and mahtab had been allowed to see him only once."
13806,interrogation,"munis and mahtab had both endured intense interrogation during their time in solitary, living in cells half the size of the one we were in, which had scarcely left them room to sit."
13807,prisoners,"“we’ve heard about the dangerous, high-profile political prisoners in 209,” i said."
13808,guard,"“who would have believed this teenage girl has put the national security of our country in jeopardy!” when we laughed this time, no guard came to shut us up."
13809,cell,"“before i transferred to this cell,” mahtab said, “the interrogators told me i would be with two girls who had run away from home and converted to christianity."
13810,cell,"with four women in the cell, there was scarcely room to lie down."
13811,cell,"maryam the next day, i was blindfolded and taken away to another cell, separating marziyeh and me once again."
13812,cellmate,"my new cellmate was fereshteh, a middle-aged woman with short, scruffy hair, who looked like a walking skeleton."
13813,malnutrition,"she had large, sunken eyes that contrasted sharply with her starkly white skin, and her dark, bleeding gums were a testament to long periods of malnutrition in prison."
13814,cell,"“don’t sit here,” fereshteh said in a worried tone when i took a step toward her in the tiny cell."
13815,arrested,"as i related my story of being arrested for being a christian, fereshteh constantly warned me to be quiet and to be careful what i said, or else the guards would take me away and she would be alone again."
13816,confinement,"“i have been here in solitary confinement for about three months,” she began in a thin, soft voice."
13817,charged,"i’ve been charged with belonging to the mujahideen, but i’m not a member of that or any other movement or political party."
13818,crime,my real crime is being a mother who loves her children and wants to stay in touch with them.
13819,camp,“my two daughters live at the ashraf camp for mujahideen in iraq.
13820,arrested,"they ransacked our apartment, arrested us, and separated my husband and me."
13821,tortured,"i haven’t been tortured, only hit in the head and slapped, but i still have terrible headaches."
13822,torture,"i’m too weak to be a political activist, too weak to endure torture beyond what they’re already doing."
13823,authorities,"they say i’ll never walk out of 209 alive.” “dear fereshteh,” i said, “why are the authorities punishing you so harshly for sending emails to your children?” “as a student, i was politically active and wrote political articles,” fereshteh said."
13824,sentenced,"when i was twenty-two, three weeks after my wedding, i was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison."
13825,where,"for a month, my husband didn’t know where i was, and he thought i’d been killed."
13826,torture,"one by one, we were taken for interrogation and torture."
13827,execution,"some of us were led blindfolded into the execution chamber, where corpses still hung in their nooses."
13828,inside,they made us walk around inside the room for hours.
13829,guard,"when we bumped into a body, a guard would announce that person’s name."
13830,where,“my husband finally found out where i was and came to see me.
13831,evin,"‘go find a new life for yourself.’ after a year, i was transferred to evin and spent four more years here."
13832,executed,"by then, most of my friends had been tortured to death or executed."
13833,inside,“i haven’t had anyone to talk to in so long and i have all these feelings inside me.
13834,guard,"after dinner, a guard brought her a handful of sleeping pills."
13835,cell,"too keyed up to sleep and now with a pounding headache, i tried to relax by walking around the cell."
13836,injustice,"i sat staring at the white walls for hours, thinking of all the heartache, injustice, and agony those walls had seen visited upon the lives of women like fereshteh, the ocean of innocent blood spilled, tender lives like zeynab’s snuffed out by evil forces."
13837,toilet,"after breakfast the next morning, i pressed the button to summon the guard to escort me to the toilet."
13838,inside,"once inside the washroom, i was allowed to remove the blindfold."
13839,sink,a reflection behind the sink caught my eye.
13840,wall,"between the basin and the wall, balanced on a water pipe, was a cross made from the foil top of a yogurt container."
13841,cell,"when i heard someone in the next cell leave for the toilet, coughing and dragging her slippers in a distinctive way, i knew it had to be marziyeh, letting me know she’d received the message."
13842,wall,"i tried a few exploratory knocks on the wall, and the rapid response confirmed that marziyeh was just next door."
13843,toilet,"on my next trip to the toilet, i couldn’t wait to check the hiding place behind the sink for another message."
13844,cell,"the only paper in my cell was fereshteh’s copy of the koran, which i didn’t dare damage."
13845,sink,"as i scanned the spare, small room, my eyes were drawn to a tube of toothpaste, still in its carton, resting on the edge of the sink in the corner."
13846,inside,"i removed the tube, tore open the carton and flattened it out, and then smeared a light coating of toothpaste on the blank inside surface of the cardboard."
13847,toilet,"with fereshteh.” on my next visit to the toilet, i left the note behind the sink."
13848,question,"i had no paper and nothing to write with, so a note was out of the question."
13849,cellmate,"when i found out that maryam’s new cellmate was fereshteh, mahtab told me that she knew her and that she was a kind, gentle woman who would be a great companion."
13850,ward,"a trip to the clinic in ward 209—not actually a clinic, but just a room with a bed—yielded another round of ineffective antibiotics."
13851,ward,"maryam as the days passed, the guards in ward 209 grew curious about christianity, just as some of the guards in ward 2 had."
13852,case,"in any case, whoever this jesus christ is, he’s a very dangerous person to put you in this position.” i knew that any explanation would fall on deaf ears, but i prayed that jesus would open this woman’s heart to the truth."
13853,cell,"in our cell, fereshteh spent hours every day reading the koran and using her prayer beads."
13854,inside,and yet she acknowledged an emptiness inside.
13855,inmate,"this from an inmate who had flinched at the slightest word when i first arrived, fearful that the guards would crack down on us."
13856,guard,"one afternoon, when i became too dizzy to stand, fereshteh called for a guard to take me to the clinic."
13857,guard,"one morning, when the guard came in with breakfast, i stood to take the plate and fainted, falling backward."
13858,wall,fereshteh later told me that the crack of my head against the wall was so loud that the guard put down her tray and rushed over to check on me.
13859,guard,"after taking them for only a day, i told the guard that i wouldn’t take them anymore."
13860,guard,"the guard agreed, but made me sign a statement saying i had refused the medication."
13861,prisoners,"the rules demanding quiet, coupled with the fact that prisoners always wore blindfolds outside their cells, created a powerful sense of isolation."
13862,toilet,"the only breaks in the day were meals, trips to the toilet, and a one-hour period spent in the larger room with the clear skylight."
13863,sink,"marziyeh and i kept up our clandestine communication, leaving tokens to each other behind the sink, and we deepened our friendships with our cellmates."
13864,ward,"the next time i saw marziyeh was on visiting day, about two weeks after our transfer to ward 209."
13865,taken,"after being blindfolded and taken separately from our cells, we were brought outside to wait for a ride to the visitors’ hall."
13866,where,"out in the courtyard, where we were allowed to remove our blindfolds, we discovered we were standing only a few feet from each other."
13867,cell,"we nodded, speaking only with our eyes, but one of the guards saw us and shouted, “no talking, you two!” i was overwhelmed with joy at seeing and feeling the sun after being locked up in a six-bysix-foot cell for two weeks."
13868,ward,"the process of leaving ward 209, waiting for the car, driving to the visitors’ hall, and waiting again to be escorted inside, took hours."
13869,wall,"we sat in adjacent cubicles, with shirin and elena on the visitors’ side, separated from us by a glass wall."
13870,cell,"after two weeks in a windowless cell, i was as pale as a ghost."
13871,ward,"i told her only a little about the conditions in ward 209, because i didn’t want her to worry."
13872,cell,"by the time they woke up, i had already arranged our breakfast of boiled eggs on the softe [a plastic tray about the size of a newspaper, which we used in place of a table in the cell]."
13873,lawyer,"first, our faithful and hardworking lawyer, mr. soltani, had not given up on us."
13874,court,"he had continually tried to get inside evin to visit us and to get our signatures, which would give him legal permission to represent us in court."
13875,inmate,"for his dedication and commitment, he himself had been arrested and was now an inmate in ward 209."
13876,prisoners,"for defending the human rights of political prisoners in iran, for standing up to the false arrest and widespread abuse of those prisoners, he had now joined their ranks!"
13877,sentenced,(he was sentenced to twenty years and forbidden to practice law.
13878,inmates,"the second important news was that we were not the isolated, anonymous inmates we thought we were; thousands of people were praying for us and working for our release."
13879,interrogation,the first indication we’d had of any of this was mr. mosavat’s remark at our interrogation that one of our sisters had been interviewed by voice of america.
13880,case,"in fact, through the efforts of our friends, along with people we didn’t even know, our case had been taken up by amnesty international."
13881,prisoners,"a press release on april 8, 2009, identified us as prisoners of conscience, “detained solely on account of their religious beliefs.” the press release mentioned our illnesses and the crowded conditions in ward 2 of evin prison."
13882,taken,"it also quoted article 23 of the iranian constitution, which says, “the investigation of individuals’ beliefs is forbidden, and no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief,”[3] and article 18.1 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (to which iran is a party), which states, “everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."
13883,freedom,"this right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.”[4] the amnesty international document noted that “evangelical christians ."
13884,authorities,often face harassment by the authorities.
13885,arrest,"converts from islam can risk arrest, attack, or the death penalty."
13886,death,"conversion from islam (apostasy) is considered as forbidden under islamic law, which requires apostates to be put to death if they refuse to reconvert to islam."
13887,penal,"there is no specific provision in the iranian penal code for apostasy, but judges are required to use their knowledge of islamic law to rule on cases where no specific legislation exists in the penal code."
13888,penal,"a new version of the iranian penal code is currently under consideration by the [parliament] and prescribes the death penalty for those considered to be apostates.”[5] amnesty international encouraged appeals to the iranian authorities for our immediate and unconditional release, along with contact information for writing to the director of the human rights headquarters of iran, the head of the judiciary, and ayatollah sayed ali khamenei, the supreme leader of the islamic republic."
13889,case,"elam ministries, the london-based organization that sponsored the theology conference in turkey where maryam and i first met, was also publicizing our case."
13890,arrest,they had provided us with support and the new testaments we had distributed before our arrest.
13891,freedom,now they were trying to help us win our freedom.
13892,authorities,"the world was watching how the iranian government treated us, and it made the  authorities very nervous."
13893,ward,elena was convinced that our transfer to ward 209 was a sign that our case was about to be closed and we would be released.
13894,cell,"nothing could ruin the joy of the moment; not even being blindfolded, separated again from my sister and maryam, and returned to my tiny, sunless cell."
13895,ward,"chapter 14 “execute us!” marziyeh during our two weeks in ward 209, we had not been interrogated a single time."
13896,where,where do you get your bibles?
13897,interrogation,"do you have any complaints?” when i entered the interrogation room, mr. mosavat offered to let me take off my blindfold."
13898,ward,"“i am quite happy right now, and i prefer not to see your face.” i voiced my anger at being separated from maryam when we returned to ward 2 after our first interrogation, but added, “i must thank you for this kindness, because you have enabled me to talk about jesus christ with even more people.” “i didn’t order you to be sent to separate floors, only separate cells,” mr. mosavat fumed."
13899,prisoners,"i advise you to stop insisting on your faith, recant your statements, get your freedom, and then go have fun and enjoy life.” clearly, he was used to having the upper hand, which was essential for making prisoners afraid and for making them say or do whatever he wanted."
13900,question,"that is a really stupid question.” “have you ever been in love?” “that has nothing to do with any of this.” “you’re right, it’s irrelevant."
13901,ward,"it was mr. sedaghat, the official in charge of ward 209."
13902,arrest,“who are you using to write about your arrest?” “no one.
13903,situation,"obviously, the church will react to this situation and publish news about it.” “we have no problem with people reading the bible.” “then why have you banned it from the bookshops?” “who is your pastor at the moment?” mr. mosavat demanded."
13904,police,“jesus christ is my pastor.”  the questioners again went over my statements from the police station when mr. rasti had written both the questions and the answers.
13905,police,"“this says that the police found eight hundred bibles and thirty thousand cds in my house, all gift wrapped, and that i drove around iran distributing them."
13906,ordered,“look at me!” he ordered.
13907,freed,don’t think you can be freed and go home just like that.
13908,power,"do you think these interrogations are the only power at our disposal?” “i understand what you’re saying,” i said, my voice steady."
13909,death,“but i believe the times of our birth and death are in the hands of god alone.
13910,killing,"now if we’re killed outside this prison, our friends will know you’re responsible.” “you’re not worth killing at the risk of our careers and reputations,” mr. sedaghat snapped."
13911,court,"they are free to shed your blood, and the court will judge their actions as justified.” “then i’m happy i am not a muslim."
13912,freedom,"if everyone had the freedom to study and believe and share whatever faith their hearts called them to believe, iran would not be in the mess it’s in and i would not be sitting here being grilled by you.” mr. mosavat put on a big, brave, plastic smile."
13913,where,"even i may not agree with all of them, but i have to follow them or i’ll end up where you are."
13914,where,"even church members are harassed trying to get in, never mind prospective visitors.” “where were you baptized?” mr. mosavat interjected."
13915,prisoners,"the isolation of the tiny, windowless cells, the nearly silent ward, wearing blindfolds everywhere, and being surrounded by other prisoners i could never see were hard conditions to endure."
13916,ward,the fact that we never left our cells without blindfolds compounded the oppressive atmosphere and sense of isolation in ward 209.
13917,prisoners,"another hard thing to endure was hearing the disembodied voices of other prisoners we had never seen, crying out in agony."
13918,cell,he started pounding on the metal walls of his cell.
13919,cell,"after a few minutes, i heard several guards go down the hall and open the door to the boy’s cell."
13920,wall,"sometimes, the club would miss its target and boom against the wall like a cannon shot."
13921,cell,another woman in a nearby cell moaned and cried so much that i thought she must have been put near us just to keep us awake at night.
13922,cell,i put my hands on the wall nearest her cell and prayed for her peace of mind.
13923,cell,"one night, i dreamed that the guards let this woman out of her cell."
13924,cell,"in the dream, she came into my cell and put her head in my lap."
13925,transferred,"when i started praying for her, all her sorrows and problems were transferred to my shoulders, so heavy and unbearable that they made me collapse."
13926,cell,"a couple of hours later, the guards came to the woman’s cell and we heard her say, “thank you!"
13927,freedom,"oh thank you!” from the conversation, it was clear she was getting her freedom."
13928,court,"a few days after our interrogations, maryam and i were taken again to security bureau 2 of the revolutionary court."
13929,evin,we hadn’t seen the city since arriving at evin two months before.
13930,locked,look at how your corrupt government has locked us up on phony charges!
13931,power,"look at how the regime imprisons young mothers and tortures teenage girls in order to stay in power!” at the same time, there was something genuine about the pain and suffering and the fight for truth inside evin that was entirely absent from the scene on the street."
13932,court,we arrived at the court and went into mr. sobhani’s office.
13933,court,“we have nothing to do with people’s beliefs!” this statement by judge sobhani of the revolutionary court of iran is our nominee for lie of the century.
13934,crime,"you are criminals, and i will perform my religious duty.” “then why don’t you allow our case to be broadcast on iranian tv, so people will understand that doing what we do is a crime?” i asked."
13935,state,"“do you have any complaints about prison conditions?” “we object to our conditions, and also to being kept in a state of suspense about the  charges against us,” maryam said."
13936,sentence,do you accept these charges?” “no.” “you are regarded as apostates and your sentence is death.
13937,ordered,“of course i will.” judge sobhani angrily ordered us to write down our final defense statements.
13938,charges,"we had answered the charges against us so many times, both orally and in writing, that we had lost count."
13939,sentence,"“i found my path in jesus christ and will share my experience about him with anyone who asks about it.” i ended my written statement with a prediction: “if the court and the judge ignore the principles of justice and truth and deliver an unjust sentence, they will face the wrath of god, which will one day engulf them in its flames.” another man came in while we were talking to mr. sobhani."
13940,case,"his name was mr. heydarifar, and he had been assigned to our case by the regime because the publicity was starting to worry them."
13941,case,too many eyes were watching our case now for us to simply disappear or be the victims of a “tragic accident.” we were not recanting our statements.
13942,charges,"the regime was faced with justifying its charges against us to the world, and they were beginning to realize that it was an impossible task."
13943,where,i reached a point where i couldn’t eat and felt an emptiness i’d never known before as a christian.
13944,cell,"i prayed, walking around my tiny cell, asking the lord to make himself known in a special way."
13945,building,"at dinnertime, the guard we called the ghost came with our food and said, “you did whatever you wanted today, and your voice carried all the way to the other side of the building.” “but i didn’t do anything,” i said."
13946,ward,"would you pray for me?” “i will be happy to.” and so i prayed for my captor, secure in the presence of the lord that washed over me in waves, in the deepest recesses of the most feared ward of the most notorious prison in one of the most oppressed nations of the world."
13947,case,chapter 15 a lesson in faith marziyeh maryam and i heard more news of the growing interest in our case during the next fifteenminute visit with our sisters.
13948,court,mr. mosavat explained that our defiant attitude toward mr. sobhani during our last court appearance had made the judge angry and complicated the resolution of our case.
13949,case,also present at these sessions was a university lecturer in islamic theology who had come to coach us on how to express ourselves in order to have our case resolved.
13950,court,the court seemed less worried now about what we believed than about how we described it.
13951,cell,"in my cell at this moment is a teenage girl, named mahtab, who has been here for three months for the ‘crime’ of being born among the mujahideen."
13952,tortured,i have come across countless girls who have been tortured and beaten by your collaborators.
13953,prisoners,"“i have come here only to deal with you, and i know nothing about the other prisoners in 209.” “all it takes is a look around.” “in any case, i’ve come here to tell you that your insistence on your faith is going to cause you a lot of problems."
13954,court,"we’ve done our best to assist you and close your case, but your defiance in court has created more problems."
13955,arrested,"if you keep this up, there’s nothing we can do to help you.” “all the others we’ve arrested,” mr. mosavat chimed in, “have eventually cooperated, and by changing their opinions and their language, they bought their freedom."
13956,power,power mongering?
13957,freedom,"by paying the price we could never pay, he gave us the priceless, holy gift of freedom—freedom from sin and freedom from religious laws we could never perfectly follow as imperfect mortals."
13958,death,"“religious law brings condemnation and death, not forgiveness and freedom."
13959,executed,i know a precious young woman named zeynab who was executed in retribution for defending her life against a brutal husband she was forced by religious law to marry and prevented by religious law from escaping.
13960,death,compare that with the story of jesus hearing about a woman accused of adultery and condemned to death by stoning.
13961,court,"in fact, if i were your family, i wouldn’t wait for a court verdict before giving you what you deserve.” “i’m sure you’d kill me yourself,” i said."
13962,freedom,"i believe everyone should know about christ and have the freedom to accept or reject him according to their own hearts.” the professor countered, “the koran says anyone can become a muslim, but muslims cannot turn their backs on their faith."
13963,law,christ came to free the world from the condemnation of religious law.
13964,law,jesus took the blame for all of our sins and shortcomings in order to free us from the consequences of failing to follow the law.
13965,inside,your faith is on the inside and you stand firm for your beliefs.
13966,law,"and don’t hand out bibles, because it’s against the law.” “we won’t be handing out bibles, because you’ve taken them all away,” i reminded him."
13967,case,"he doesn’t need books, and he doesn’t need marziyeh and me.” “miss rostampour,” mr. mosavat said, “we hope by next week your case will be closed and you will be back home."
13968,court,we’re just waiting for the election to be over and for the appointments of court officials to be reconfirmed.
13969,case,"if mr. mousavi wins, it will have a positive effect on your case."
13970,court,"only please, if you’re summoned to court again, keep silent and don’t even smile."
13971,case,"separately, maryam and i had the same reaction: if that’s the case, then there’s no reason to keep us separated any longer."
13972,cell,"at our request, i was allowed to move out of the cell with munis and mahtab—leaving with hugs and tears of farewell—and in with maryam and fereshteh."
13973,cell,"at the doorway to maryam’s cell, we fell into each other’s arms, sobbing with happiness."
13974,cell,"“come on, come on,” the guard said curtly, “get on with it and get inside the cell.” we also asked for a bible and a television in our room."
13975,cell,"when i entered the cell, the first things i saw, decorating the whole space, were the crosses and other tokens i’d left for maryam."
13976,case,"of course, we didn’t have access to any of the coverage of our case that our sisters and the professor had spoken about."
13977,guard,"one afternoon, the guard we’d nicknamed grumpy said she was taking us to make phone calls."
13978,guard,"when maryam tried to explain the mix-up, the guard shouted at her, though eventually she let her call the right number."
13979,guard,"when my turn came, the guard played the same game, handing me the number from our apartment and saying it was the only number i could call."
13980,guard,“there’s nobody there.” “you’re lying to me!” the guard scolded.
13981,guard,"“i’m in prison for telling the truth.” the argument escalated into a shouting match, though finally the guard realized her mistake and let me call my sister."
13982,cell,"after speaking to elena for only a moment, i had to cut short the call and go back to the cell."
13983,guard,"maryam and fereshteh called for the guard, who was suddenly afraid she would get in trouble for causing this attack."
13984,where,"they took me to the clinic, where the doctor gave me a shot and put me on oxygen."
13985,toilet,"a few days later, just before lunch, maryam went to the toilet room to wash her hands."
13986,guard,"her guard, the woman we had nicknamed ghost, rushed over to see what was wrong."
13987,cell,the three of us helped maryam back to our cell.
13988,ward,"we wrote to the head of the prison, asking to be returned to ward 2 in the public section."
13989,taken,"yet as the day went on, iranian tv reported that mr. ahmadinejad had taken the lead and held it, reminding viewers all the while that the regime was dedicated to truth and accuracy in the election."
13990,ward,"a couple of days later, we were told we were leaving ward 209."
13991,ward,"it was probably due to the fact that, within hours, hundreds of people arrested in the election protests overran the cells of ward 209."
13992,cell,we weren’t sure whether we were being released or simply going back to our old cell in ward 2.
13993,ward,"when the time came, a guard walked us across the yard to the public section and back into ward 2."
13994,prisoners,"as we were being processed back into the ward, an elderly guard asked if we were political prisoners."
13995,prisoners,"“we came from 209, but we’re not political prisoners,” maryam told her."
13996,crime,"i didn’t know that was a crime.” “we converted.” the guard’s face puckered in disapproval, like she’d just bitten a lemon."
13997,crime,"couldn’t you commit a better crime?” we went through the security search and changed back into our own clothes, leaving behind the baggy men’s prison uniforms that looked so hilarious."
13998,ward,"then we ran up the stairs to ward 2, eager to see the many dear friends who had been absent from our lives but held fast in our hearts and prayers."
13999,freedom,chapter 16 a different freedom marziyeh it was a joyful homecoming.
14000,ward,"as soon as maryam and i walked through the barred door into ward 2, we met vida in the corridor."
14001,ward,she hugged us excitedly and announced our arrival to the rest of the ward.
14002,evin,"after the isolation of 209, returning to the public area of evin prison felt almost like being free."
14003,ward,they only asked lots of questions.” there had been changes in the ward during the five and a half weeks we’d been away.
14004,freed,our friend arezoo had been freed.
14005,freedom,she told rozita that her freedom was the answer to my prayers for her.
14006,where,"we worried about them, wondering where they were and what they were doing, how they were coping with the wounds on their bodies and the even more painful scars on their hearts."
14007,prisoners,will i ever see the whole thing again?” it is the universal lament of prisoners everywhere: seeing only a little square of sky reminds them of their isolation from the world and makes them long for more.
14008,prisoners,"the leader in ward 2, mrs. mahjoob, who had welcomed us on our first day at evin, had been transferred to ward 3, where the psychological prisoners lived."
14009,prisoners,"our friend rozita was now the telephone monitor, and she spent most of her day in a chair beside the phones, trying to keep other prisoners from arguing and fighting over who could talk and for how long."
14010,prisoners,"as we settled in, we learned about prisoners who’d arrived while we were away."
14011,arrested,some had been arrested for associating with the opposition during the election—the aftermath was still stirring up lots of controversy.
14012,prisoners,"some prisoners took ahmadinejad’s reelection very hard, because they had hoped a new leader would mean their freedom."
14013,illegal,“they have no right to stop me.” the regime had falsely accused her of being a computer expert exchanging illegal information on the internet.
14014,sentenced,"after forcing a false confession from her, they sentenced this mild-mannered, elderly lady to eight years in prison."
14015,confinement,she had been in solitary confinement for fifty days before coming to ward 2.
14016,arrested,"they turned on her, kicking and punching her, and arrested them both."
14017,court,"when their father complained to the police, the court dismissed his complaint and ordered the two children to apologize to the soldiers for filing charges against them."
14018,sentenced,"they had refused, and the judge sentenced the girl to prison."
14019,injustice,"“he told them, ‘we detest this islam of yours, which is just an excuse for injustice and repression."
14020,court,there’s no point in allowing my daughter to remain muslim for even one more day of her life.’”  the court ordered her to be held in custody until she apologized.
14021,arrest,this is a common demand; otherwise it would be clear that the government had been wrong to arrest her.
14022,question,but most people never read it for themselves because the text is in arabic and because they’re afraid of being fined or punished if they drop it accidentally or handle it with impure hands or question anything it says.
14023,power,islam does its best to keep people away from god and a personal relationship with him because that direct connection threatens the power and control of the religious leaders.
14024,criminals,"the criminals who run iran are running it in accordance with islamic statutes.” maryam during our weeks of isolation, we had often thought about the children, and now we were anxious to see them."
14025,evin,"i asked rozita about pouneh’s son, alfi, who had been born not long after we arrived at evin, and a few minutes later she brought him in to see us."
14026,where,"we hugged him happily, and then went down the hall to the room where all the mothers and their young children lived."
14027,where,"they were delighted to see us, eager to know where we’d been and what had happened, piling on their questions one after another."
14028,authorities,"when aboubakr turned three, the authorities took him away and sent his mother downstairs to live with the other drug addicts."
14029,authorities,"now that he was in the hands of the authorities, they could do whatever they wanted to either one of them without being accountable to anyone."
14030,ward,"their room seemed peaceful, a separate world from the tense, oppressive atmosphere of the rest of the ward."
14031,crimes,the little ones were too young to know they were being cruelly punished for crimes they hadn’t committed.
14032,arrested,"nobody asked them, why were you arrested?"
14033,bail,do you have bail?
14034,court,when will you go to court?
14035,sentence,how long is your sentence?
14036,crime,their only crime was being the children of women on the wrong side of sharia law.
14037,prisoners,"they lived with few toys or little luxuries of any kind, bad food, poor medical care, scant sunshine, no fresh air, no trees or birds or flowers to spark their curiosity, no grass to run through barefoot, no sense of family, surrounded by adult prisoners who were as likely to despise them as pay them any attention."
14038,sentence,"“when i phoned my mother today, i learned that the court might sentence me to life in prison as an accomplice to the murder my husband committed."
14039,court,"in my anger at the court, i forgot that my son is too young to look after himself."
14040,situation,"i felt helpless at such a sad, frustrating situation."
14041,case,i don’t have anybody on the outside to follow up on my case.
14042,situation,"and what am i doing with this child in prison anyway?” “dear pouneh,” i said sternly, “i understand your situation."
14043,inmates,"marziyeh inmates typically arrived at ward 2 with few possessions, often little more than their clothes and a handful of grooming items."
14044,ward,she moved into our ward from downstairs with so much stuff that the guards gave her three beds to store it all.
14045,sentence,"tahmasebi was only thirty, but had already served thirteen years of a life sentence for smuggling drugs."
14046,evin,"tahmasebi worked as the stockroom clerk at evin and had taken samples of everything that passed through her work area over the years, including a collection of dolls that attracted lots of attention."
14047,prisoners,"though at first other prisoners resented her for taking so much room, the dolls, hangings, and other decorations she put up made the place more attractive for everybody."
14048,inmates,longtime inmates like tahmasebi claimed special privileges and tended to mix only with other long-timers.
14049,prisoners,"after a few nights, rozita introduced us to her as the “faith prisoners.” “you’re lucky to have god on your side,” she said."
14050,freedom,"“i don’t think you value freedom,” she said."
14051,freedom,"you can have freedom anytime you want, yet you stubbornly refuse.” “i understand your position,” i said."
14052,freedom,"for us, freedom makes sense only in the context of our relationship with him."
14053,freedom,"real freedom means being allowed to follow the faith you choose, not having to lock it up or hide it in a cage."
14054,locked,"“what kind of faith is it that erodes your freedom and forces you to spend your young life locked away here?” “it’s pure love,” i explained."
14055,inside,the only thing that matters is to be with your love—with god—even inside a prison.
14056,imprisoned,they have imprisoned only our bodies; they can’t imprison our souls.
14057,prisoners,"more than you can imagine.” a few nights later, i dreamed that i was handing out fish to all the prisoners, and tahmasebi wanted the biggest one."
14058,prisoners,prisoners were transferred both from prison to prison and from room to room within a prison.
14059,freedom,"i told tahmasebi, “this room is the last one you will be held in before you have your freedom.”  everybody was astonished at such a bold and outrageous prediction."
14060,sentence,"i’m serving a life sentence, and i will not be freed.” rozita turned to tahmasebi."
14061,prisoners,"she’s predicted the release of several prisoners, and every one of her predictions has come true.” then to me she added, “in fact, it’s high time you had a dream about me!” “my dear rozita,” i said, “i’m not a fortune-teller."
14062,abuse,"others didn’t withstand the conditions as well, and their spirits were broken by threats and abuse from the government."
14063,where,she had not subscribed to the stories and didn’t know where they had come from.
14064,charged,"but because the security forces found them on her hard drive, she was charged with using the internet to spread the word about postelection protests."
14065,evin,"when she first arrived at evin, all she did was sit in a corner and cry."
14066,authorities,"the authorities told her that if she wanted to be released, she had to make a video confessing that she had sent e-mails to friends and relatives asking them to take part in the protests."
14067,ordered,she did as they ordered but told me she regretted doing it.
14068,death,“they scared me to death.
14069,sentence,"they said if i didn’t cooperate, they’d keep me in prison and pass a heavy sentence on me."
14070,crimes,i had to repeat what they told me to say.” i was afraid she might also have “confessed” to other crimes that she didn’t tell me about.
14071,ward,i had met mrs. arab before marziyeh and i went to ward 209.
14072,prisoners,she was an unusually generous person who bought food for the poorest prisoners.
14073,ward,"though we had tried to resume our friendship with her when we returned to ward 2, she seemed to avoid us."
14074,prisoners,"i’ve seen you praying for other prisoners and being kind to them, but i’ve avoided getting close to you.” “we noticed that,” i said."
14075,taken,"if you have genuine faith in the path you’ve taken, why should you be afraid to talk to me?” “i come from a completely muslim background,” mrs. arab said."
14076,situation,"after several months, the situation seemed hopeless."
14077,building,"one rainy night, i passed by a building where a man stood at the door."
14078,building,“the building was a church.
14079,punishment,"i’m afraid of meeting jesus.” the idea of god as a benevolent father who forgives all our sins is entirely foreign to many muslims, who’ve been taught all their lives that god is a god of retribution and punishment."
14080,freed,she promised she would find a bible when she was freed and was very excited about taking part in a church service in the future.
14081,parole,"the rate of arrests skyrocketed, while the number of women released on parole slowed to a trickle."
14082,prisoners,"many new prisoners, especially young girls, were sent to our room because we’d gotten a reputation for being able to calm newcomers down and make them less afraid."
14083,prisoners,"when other prisoners didn’t want to hear their crying or answer their questions anymore, they sent them to “the christian girls.” marziyeh and i liked meeting new arrivals because they brought the latest news from outside."
14084,ward,"one night, after lights out, shirin alam hooli rushed into our room and said that two girls had just been transferred from ward 209."
14085,cell,"we followed her through the dark hallway to a cell where the young women sat in a corner on the floor, still dressed in the islamic covering they’d had to wear on their walk from 209."
14086,cell,“i’ve heard a lot about you from fereshteh.” “were you in fereshteh’s cell in 209?” i asked excitedly.
14087,court,what happened to her court hearing?” i was so happy to hear about my dear friend and former cellmate that i rattled off questions faster than maedeh could answer.
14088,cell,"“before i was with her, i was in a different cell in 209, and i saw the messages you had written on the walls—your names and the charges against you."
14089,detention,“were you also at the vozara detention center?
14090,where,"magda and i spent a few days there, where the walls and even the ceiling had messages like ‘christ is the savior,’ and ‘god is love.’ they gave us a feeling of peace during some very frightening days, and we wondered who’d left them there.” “yes, we did that,” marziyeh said."
14091,power,maedeh was a great example of god’s love and power even in situations that seem hopeless.
14092,ward,"if we hadn’t been in prison, we wouldn’t have had the chance to leave our messages at vozara and ward 209."
14093,arrest,"whereas before we had searched for people to speak to, now they came looking for us: “go see the christian girls!” the very prison system that tried to silence us was now our megaphone: our arrest, our story, and our message of faith were news around the world."
14094,situation,"as remarkable as that situation was, god never seemed to run out of new surprises."
14095,ward,"when we got back to ward 2, the gossipy old woman we called mommy had been moved to a new spot in the room, away from the door and into a back corner, to try to keep her from stirring up trouble."
14096,prisoner,"she kept telling stories about inmates, spreading rumors, and trying to turn one prisoner against another."
14097,charges,"a new girl, named mahnaz, was in on drug charges."
14098,inmates,inmates waited hours in the hall outside the warden’s door for a meeting that might last ten minutes at most.
14099,prisoners,we knew from experience that prison officials were more careful with political prisoners because they were more likely than others to spread the news of how they were treated.
14100,ward,"“we’re sure you have heard of the fistfights she has caused recently in our ward,” i said."
14101,inmates,“she also has a habit of telling new prisoners all about the other inmates.
14102,ordered,“who has ordered this?” “mrs.
14103,prisoners,she would be moved away from the political prisoners and in with the murderers.
14104,parole,our friend mrs. arab returned from her parole.
14105,parole,"it was normal for women who had been locked up for a while, and who had families, to get a temporary parole to visit their relatives."
14106,evin,"one night, not long after she returned to evin, maryam and i had a long talk with mrs. arab about jesus."
14107,cellblock,"when the guards closed the cellblock for the night, mrs. arab called us to her bed."
14108,sentences,“the sentences were talking to me.
14109,imprisoned,"maryam we had now been imprisoned for nearly six months, including two weeks at the vozara police station and thirty-eight days in isolation in ward 209."
14110,court,"we still had not met with a lawyer who was in a position to represent us in court, and still had not seen the charges against us in writing."
14111,freedom,we had come to terms with the fact that there was nothing else we could do to gain our freedom.
14112,prisoners,"rather than worrying about our release, we focused on getting through each day and reaching out to our fellow prisoners with encouragement and compassion."
14113,interrogation,we’d heard about this during our most recent interrogation.
14114,prisoners,we didn’t care about the celebrity; the advantage to us was that it made new prisoners seek us out and ask us questions about our faith.
14115,where,"in an alien environment where they were disoriented and afraid, our familiar faces attracted them."
14116,criminals,"we heard her crying and saying, “i don’t belong here with all these criminals!” later, she started crying again, making an irritating noise like she was trying to get attention."
14117,prisoners,"if my husband could have paid my bail, i wouldn’t be spending the night with these prisoners."
14118,prisoners,"i’m afraid of them.” “all prisoners are not criminals,” i said softly."
14119,prisoners,“many of the people here are political  prisoners or have been arrested on financial charges.
14120,prisoner,you don’t have to be afraid of them.” “are you a political prisoner?” the woman asked.
14121,jailed,"“no, my friend and i have been jailed because of our belief in jesus christ.” the woman sat up straight with a start."
14122,prisoners,i didn’t think they would keep you here with the regular prisoners.
14123,inmates,"in fact, if you keep crying, the long-term inmates will get angry and send you down the hall to sleep with the murderers."
14124,inmate,"on the morning of her release, she said, “as soon as i get out, i’m going to tell everybody i saw you in person!” a few days later, marziyeh and i were visiting with shirin alam hooli in room 2 when another new inmate sat down beside us and asked excitedly, “are you the two christian girls who are supposed to be executed?” we all laughed at the question, but then we asked how she knew about us and that we were supposed to be executed."
14125,executed,“i’ve heard you will be executed.
14126,prisoner,"another prisoner, mrs. pari, came back from parole with news that her daughter’s home church was praying for us."
14127,convict,it will be hard for the government to convict you.
14128,inmates,shirin alam hooli had knitted a beautiful bag for me; others made gifts in the craft center or bought them from other inmates.
14129,prisoners,my cross necklace was yet another way to attract the attention of new prisoners.
14130,arrested,"there were ten girls, all still in their party clothes from when they had been arrested for improper social contact under sharia law."
14131,where,we came here for vacation and were invited to a garden party where there were both boys and girls.
14132,arrested,"an hour after the party started, officers came and  arrested us all."
14133,bail,"we’re waiting to find out how much our bail is, but nobody knows we’re christians."
14134,cell,their biggest worry at the moment was that there were pictures of their baptisms in the cell phones the police had confiscated.
14135,authorities,"if the authorities saw the photos, the girls would be in serious trouble."
14136,inside,"we feel ashamed because we actually are christians, but are afraid to say so openly, and many things inside our hearts still haven’t changed.” i spoke to them and encouraged the whole group."
14137,bail,"the next day, they paid their bail and left."
14138,case,"as they were going, one of them said, “it seems like the only reason for us coming to prison was to meet you.” by now, our case had been mentioned in several official reports that were circulated by amnesty international, the united nations, and the european parliament about the brutality of the iranian government."
14139,detention,"on august 14, jubilee campaign usa submitted a formal petition to the united nations working group on arbitrary detention, requesting help for us."
14140,prisoners,we knew the iranian judges were much more lenient when accused prisoners begged them for mercy and made them feel important.
14141,court,"our elderly friend sousan, sentenced to eight years, had had her term reduced to one year after her sister went to court and begged the judge on her knees for help."
14142,cell,a few brave citizens made videos with their cell phones and broadcast the truth to the world.
14143,police,the security police tried to keep a lid on the uprising by cutting off communication inside the country and censoring the news even more than usual.
14144,prisoners,"within the walls of evin prison, the overcrowding went from extreme to unimaginable, with prisoners packed in so tightly that guards couldn’t even enter our rooms."
14145,prisoners,we had to stop using windowsills as storage shelves and drying racks because new prisoners had to have the space.
14146,stretch,their blankets completely covered the floors; at night it was hard for everyone to find room to stretch out.
14147,ward,"we heard that hundreds of young girls arrested in the streets were downstairs in the drug addict ward, and that hundreds more were being held in schools because the prisons couldn’t take any more."
14148,state,"the only hint we had at the time of the scope of the protest, other than the prison filled to bursting, was through the censored stories on state tv."
14149,prisoners,many prisoners accused of fraud and other nonviolent crimes had expected to be released under the newly elected administration.
14150,charges,"instead, the investigation of all charges ground to a halt."
14151,prisoners,"they were the first ones to learn that the ashraf camp in iraq, where so many mujahideen prisoners had friends and family, had been attacked by iraqi soldiers, killing or injuring many of the refugees there."
14152,camp,she felt sure that the iraqi and iranian government officials had worked to distract the attention of the world from the internal political demonstrations by slaughtering innocent people in this iraqi camp.
14153,arrest,it was all part of the regime’s plan to arrest mujahideen and their supporters without any evidence and send them away to be tortured.
14154,evin,"as the crisis in ashraf played out, the authorities told tahereh she was being transferred to another prison with a reputation even worse than evin’s."
14155,sentence,"she had appealed her five-year sentence, and though the appeal had not yet been heard, she was being transferred anyway."
14156,charge,"the women’s warden made a call, but the person in charge at the other prison was at lunch."
14157,officers,"that afternoon, officers from the other prison arrived with a written order and took her away."
14158,sentence,"the first was tahmasebi, who had served thirteen years of a life sentence and thought i was crazy for predicting she would be free in six months."
14159,ward,everyone on the ward remembered my dream and the prediction that tahmasebi would have  her freedom.
14160,prisoners,"one of the other women asked, “why is it that the christians’ prayers and dreams lead prisoners to freedom?” “it isn’t us,” i explained."
14161,freedom,"she was convinced that her freedom was impossible, but for god, nothing is impossible."
14162,prisoner,"once a prisoner knows she will be released, the final few days seem as long and agonizing as all the years before."
14163,criminal,"she had no skills, no money, and a criminal record."
14164,ward,"as the day of her release approached, the women on the ward threw a party for her, with singing and dancing."
14165,evin,"then with a last smile, she turned and was gone through the doors of evin prison to the blue skies and fresh air of freedom."
14166,sentence,"because she had served only one year of a three-year sentence, she was not optimistic that she would be out anytime soon."
14167,ward,"sometimes she was taken to ward 209 for a day of interrogation, as we had been, though she was often beaten as the authorities constantly pressured her to turn over names of other members of pjak."
14168,torture,"even though shirin had been through some of the most severe torture we’d heard about— hung by her heels, whipped on the soles of her feet, kicked in the stomach until she vomited blood, beaten unconscious for days—she had the will of an ox, and her pride in her kurdish heritage and loyalty to the pjak political movement were unshakable."
14169,toilet,"one time, the pipes in the toilet became blocked."
14170,guard,"the guard reported her to the warden, and mrs. rezaei summoned her to the office."
14171,charge,"that, plus the charge against her as an enemy of god—punishable by death—added weight to the smallest incident."
14172,injustice,"she was a radical, stubborn girl who believed the struggle against kurdish injustice should be fought in the open."
14173,prisoners,"when a top judge was murdered in kurdistan, the regime interrogated all the kurdish prisoners associated with pjak, including shirin."
14174,torture,"instead of answering their questions, she grilled them about the torture she had endured and demanded they answer for it."
14175,malnutrition,"with her eyes weakening and her hair falling out because of malnutrition, she looked ineffective and helpless."
14176,inside,but inside she had the heart of a lion.
14177,freedom,it was painful to see a young woman so kind and full of life make such a hard sacrifice in pursuing her goals of freedom for the kurdish people and especially kurdish women.
14178,freedom,we encouraged her to stand for the dignity and freedom of her people but not get caught up in politics.
14179,evin,"maryam every so often, we had groups of official visitors at evin prison."
14180,ward,"they were always taken to the newest, cleanest parts of evin, which meant that most of them didn’t come into ward 2."
14181,ward,"typically, they saw only the cultural center and ward 3."
14182,guard,"still, we had to sit on the floor wearing our veils for hours before a guard would come through shouting, “finished!"
14183,prisoners,"new prisoners kept pouring in, even after we thought our cells couldn’t possibly hold another body."
14184,arrested,"one new arrival was zari, a former professional basketball player at least six feet tall, who had been arrested for fraud."
14185,situation,"she had been married only two months and was afraid her husband would divorce her now that she had been arrested; his parents didn’t know about her situation, and she was worried what would happen when they found out."
14186,inmate,"another new inmate was shahla, who soon became friends with shirin, marziyeh, and me."
14187,arrested,she actually lived outside the country and had been arrested when she came to iran to visit.
14188,evin,so many women and girls came and went during our stay in evin.
14189,imprisonment,"from the earliest days of our imprisonment, we both had serious health problems."
14190,exercise,we were severely undernourished and had almost no exercise and not enough sunlight.
14191,imprisonment,we felt sick or in pain every day of our imprisonment.
14192,prisoners,"few prisoners observed the fast, but for the entire month, the meals were served only before dawn or after dark."
14193,prisons,the canned food was always some horrible brand sold only in prisons.
14194,prisoners,some guards themselves had lesbian encounters with the prisoners.
14195,charges,“what are the charges against you?
14196,ward,dr. avesta and a few other doctors in ward 209 have seen me.” “are you here for your belief in christianity or for your conversion from islam?” “i converted to christianity eleven years ago.” dr. kashani looked back down at her desktop.
14197,prisoner,"your condition is not so serious as to need vitamins.” then she yelled to the clerk through the doorway, “next!” our health crisis took an even more dangerous turn when a prisoner came in with a case of swine flu."
14198,ward,"before long, half the ward had the flu, including marziyeh."
14199,prisoners,none of the sick prisoners received any medicine or treatment.
14200,case,one week melted into another as we waited in vain for some news of our case.
14201,lawyer,"our lawyer, mr. soltani, who had seemed so capable and dedicated to defending our rights, was still in prison."
14202,trial,we didn’t know when or if we would have a trial.
14203,executed,"we kept hearing conflicting reports—some questioning whether we’d even broken a law, and others suggesting we would be condemned as apostates and executed."
14204,law,iran’s civil law specified that religion was a personal decision and that everyone was officially allowed to observe their religion openly.
14205,death,"however, it was an offense punishable by death to convert from islam or to induce someone to convert."
14206,execution,"to further confuse matters, the part of the national penal code calling for execution of apostates was currently in draft form and not officially approved by the guardian council, the islamic elders who ran the country."
14207,penal,judges were directed to use their personal knowledge of sharia law to decide matters that weren’t specifically covered in the penal code.
14208,death,"so if a judge personally thought we were  apostates, he could condemn us to death, whether the law was officially approved or not."
14209,case,or he could keep delaying action on our case until the law was passed and execute us then.
14210,lawyer,"we had to have a new lawyer and decided to try to get mr. aghasi, a famous lawyer in iran."
14211,case,"he agreed to take our case, but as before, he had to get our written permission to represent us."
14212,court,"with all the interference from the prison and the court, it had taken poor mr. soltani months of fruitless trips, calls, and cajoling to try to complete even that simple step."
14213,evin,marziyeh asked the social worker at evin exactly what the procedure was and who should be involved.
14214,prisoners,a social worker would pass it to mr. aghasi in the prisoners’ visiting hall.
14215,court,"(this, we later learned, is what americans call a “catch-22.”) it wasn’t even clear if the court would let us have a lawyer."
14216,court,"the “investigations” were still going on, and the intelligence ministry had still not given permission for us to be represented in court."
14217,arrest,"also about this time, we had our first contact visit with our sisters since our arrest."
14218,prisoners,"usually, only prisoners who had close ties with the authorities or spent time in the cultural center were allowed these visits, and we had been banned from the center by the director."
14219,prisoners,"the few prisoners who were allowed contact visits met their guests in a different place than where normal visits occurred, a big room downstairs furnished with tables and chairs."
14220,guard,"we had just sat down together, the four of us, when another self-important guard came over and told us we could only sit in pairs."
14221,guard,a guard walked up and stood beside my sister and me.
14222,jail,"after listening for a moment, he looked at shirin and said, “if your sister did no wrong, she would not be in jail now.” shirin stopped talking long enough to look him in the eye and say, “i take pride in my sister!” this guard had been extremely rude to us in the beginning, but he had softened his attitude over time to the point where he was almost friendly."
14223,charges,"a few nights ago, i saw you on the voice of america, and that was the first time i knew what your charges were.” he leaned in a little."
14224,freedom,“i hope you will get your freedom.
14225,authorities,chapter 19 beyond comprehension marziyeh there was one other kind of visit available by special request from prison authorities.
14226,prisoner,a shari’a visit was a private meeting between a prisoner and her husband.
14227,building,"if they could show a marriage certificate, or had a sigheh temporary marriage, they were allowed to spend the day together in a large suite in a separate building near the main visiting area."
14228,arrested,"little zari, the towering ex-basketball player, missed her husband terribly and was very afraid he would divorce her for being arrested."
14229,imprisoned,"we knew she had been imprisoned for murdering her mother-in-law, but we hadn’t heard the whole story."
14230,police,"how could the police not know the truth?” “one day, he got into an argument with his mother."
14231,torture,the police investigated us both and forced a confession out of us by torture.
14232,crime,"“recently, the police decided to reopen the investigation, because by the way i described the crime scene they suspected i wasn’t really there and that my husband was the murderer."
14233,guilty,"now that the police suspect him, he visits me every week, and we have a private visit as often as possible so that i won’t tell them he’s actually the guilty one.” maryam and i prayed for her and from then on tried to be close when she was lonely and upset."
14234,death,"she couldn’t bring herself to accuse her husband, believing it would mean certain death for him."
14235,imprisoned,so many of the women of evin were imprisoned unfairly.
14236,guilty,"there were countless stories of women who were only trying to protect themselves, who had been pushed to the breaking point by the ruthless laws that gave men unlimited control over women or who, like naseem, were locked up because of a convoluted family situation that pressured them into sacrificing their freedom to protect the guilty."
14237,crimes,"in any civilized country, these women would be recognized for what they were: mentally ill people who had no idea what they were doing and could not be responsible for their crimes."
14238,where,"they should have been somewhere where they could do no harm and where they could get help for their sickness, not condemned for behavior they couldn’t understand or control."
14239,evin,"of all the murderers we met at evin, one is burned into my mind and heart like no other."
14240,cell,maryam and i heard one night that soheila ghadiri had been taken to a solitary cell.
14241,execution,this was standard procedure on the night before an execution.
14242,cell,"it wasn’t the only reason for going to a solitary cell, but when anyone went to solitary, we all held our breath."
14243,cell,"sometimes one friend from the cell block was allowed to accompany the accused, and sometimes not."
14244,death,or would we hear of her death the next morning?
14245,insane,everyone assumed she was insane.
14246,arrested,the police arrested her for vagrancy and took her to a health care center because she was pregnant.
14247,deprivation,"when the baby was born, soheila felt she could not allow him to live a life of miserable deprivation as she had, but she saw no way of offering him anything better."
14248,court,"because the boy’s father was not available to give his consent that soheila should live, the court sentenced her to death."
14249,court,"in some cases, the court assigns a public defender to help indigent prisoners, but this was not done for soheila."
14250,lawyer,"finally, the organization one million signatures provided her with a lawyer."
14251,court,"however, soheila had been with so many men that the court ruled it wasn’t possible to know whether the young man was actually the father."
14252,insane,her lawyer advised her to claim she was insane.
14253,court,"instead, she told the court about living on the streets since she was fourteen, the many men who had abused her, the health care workers who had ignored her warning not to leave the baby with her."
14254,insane,"“i’m not insane,” she declared."
14255,hanged,"i have nothing to live for.” the morning after soheila was taken away, we learned that she had been hanged before dawn."
14256,abuse,she put up with his abuse until he made plans to sell her to one of his friends as a prostitute.
14257,law,"“all married couples have disagreements, but that’s no justification for divorce.” she then went to her mother-in-law, who was also her aunt, to beg her for help."
14258,death,"the next time he attacked her, she stabbed him to death with a knife."
14259,murder,"why should a sweet-spirited, innocent, fifteen-year-old girl have to suffer so much and be driven to murder to save her own life?"
14260,prisoners,maryam a steady stream of prisoners came and went through ward 2 at evin prison.
14261,case,the courts had  resumed their work—even seemingly hopeless cases like tahmasebi’s were resolved—yet our case went nowhere.
14262,arrest,"we knew that there was an international outcry against our arrest and demands from amnesty international, the united nations, and other groups that all charges be dropped; that the government of iran would not risk losing face by acquitting us; that, unlike most other defendants, we refused to change our story or retell it in a way that would give the government an excuse to let us go."
14263,court,"one night, with no warning, our names were called on the loudspeaker and we were told to be ready to go to court the next day."
14264,ward,shirin and our other friends worried that we would be convicted or sent back to ward 209.
14265,lawyer,"we still had no assurance that a lawyer had been secured for us, so we assumed we would have to defend ourselves."
14266,court,"the next morning, we reported to the office at 6:00 a.m., wearing our long chadors and the silly slippers prisoners had to wear to court."
14267,court,"we waited in a small, filthy building with other prisoners on their way to court that day, including one who clearly had a bad case of swine flu."
14268,where,the stale air was made even worse by the stench of dried vomit from where drug addicts had thrown up on the walls and by the smell of cigarette smoke.
14269,court,prisoners didn’t all go to court in a group.
14270,courthouse,"instead, we were handcuffed to guards one at a time and driven across town to the courthouse."
14271,court,"we had called our sisters to tell them about our court appearance, and as we pulled out from the prison gate, we saw them waiting in the street to follow us."
14272,court,"we went to the same place as before, revolutionary court, bureau 2, which heard national security cases."
14273,lawyer,"“are you miss rostampour and miss amirizadeh?” “yes, we are.” “i am mr. aghasi, your new lawyer."
14274,charges,today you will probably only hear the charges against you.
14275,court,the actual court hearing will be another day.
14276,court,"“you don’t have a court hearing after all,” he explained."
14277,building,"when you go in, be sure to insist that you want a lawyer and that you have given me permission to represent you.” mr. aghasi then wished us well, said good-bye, and left the building."
14278,courthouse,"like other rooms we’d been to in the courthouse, it was lined with photos of bloody soldiers in battle, martyrs for islam."
14279,power,an old man seated behind a desk on a raised platform—the place of power—told us to sit down.
14280,arrested,"beside him on the desk were what looked like hundreds of files marked “post-disturbance cases.” evidently, every person in the country had been arrested during the demonstrations following the sham elections."
14281,execution,"two prosecutors have issued indictments for your execution, and they are insisting that these sentences be carried out."
14282,sentence,they have forced me to confirm the sentence and send it to the court for a final order.
14283,situation,"you can simply write down that you renounce your belief in christ, and i will be able to sort the situation out for you."
14284,case,"otherwise, i will send the case to mr. salavati in bureau 15, and then i won’t be able to help you at all.” without hesitation, we both answered, “we will never renounce our faith.” “but how can you be so sure you’re right?” mr. haddad asked."
14285,power,"“do you believe that god is the ultimate power?” “yes, of course.” “then he can speak to anyone he chooses.” “yes, but you are not worthy of this gift!"
14286,law,“you christians do not have a religious law to separate good from evil.
14287,sharia,"you can sin anytime you wish.” “yes, jesus has done away with sharia laws, but he doesn’t allow us to sin whenever we like."
14288,sentenced,you have been found as apostates and sentenced accordingly for promoting christianity.
14289,lawyer,"“i can’t deal with it now!” as we stood to leave, we told him that we wanted mr. aghasi to be our lawyer and would sign whatever papers were necessary for him to represent us."
14290,guard,our guard was waiting to escort us back to our bus.
14291,cell,"we returned exhausted to our cell, where everyone wanted to know what had happened."
14292,lawyer,"our lawyer, mr. aghasi, had been granted permission to see us!"
14293,charges,"after about six months in prison, this would be our first meeting with any legal counsel—and we still had not seen the formal charges against us."
14294,prisoners,a guard walked us about two hundred yards across the courtyard to a separate building where prisoners and their attorneys met.
14295,building,"the building was a small, crowded place where guards and soldiers milled around and lawyers waited for their clients to arrive."
14296,inmates,"there was a row of glass cubicles with a table and four chairs in each, and a window between the lawyers and the inmates."
14297,where,"when our names were called, we stepped into one of the cubicles, where mr. aghasi was waiting."
14298,arrest,"therefore, i have no idea about your background, the circumstances of your arrest, previous interrogations, or what stage your case is in."
14299,trial,i’m told i will have them a couple of days before your trial so i can prepare my defense.
14300,arrest,"and what exactly are your religious beliefs?” knowing our time with mr. aghasi was limited, we briefly recounted the story of our arrest, the search of our apartment, and the various places we had been held."
14301,punishment,"he told me that if you continue to repeat your position in the courtroom, a heavy punishment awaits you."
14302,punishment,the punishment for apostates and for promoting christianity in this country is death.
14303,charges,the only way to avoid this is to deny the charges and admit you made a mistake.
14304,death,we’ve been threatened with death.
14305,death,we’re not afraid of death.
14306,lawyer,"what we’re afraid of is life without faith, life without our savior, jesus christ.” i could feel my anger rising at the very thought that our lawyer would be suggesting this now."
14307,situation,"if you are cornered in a dangerous situation, you can get out of it by telling a lie and still keep your own true belief."
14308,case,"we will never renounce our belief, even for the sake of momentary convenience.” “well, in this case, women stand a better chance of being acquitted than men,” he told us philosophically."
14309,law,"“in islam, women are given more leniency and more time to repent because according to islamic law, a woman’s wisdom is half that of a man and there’s always the likelihood they will choose the wrong path."
14310,executed,"since, according to islam, men have a full-size brain, they are not given a second opportunity but must be executed right away."
14311,guilty,"however, according to our country’s laws, you are guilty of an offense, so we must do our best to get you out of this situation.” the armed guard outside our cubicle said we had five more minutes."
14312,prisoners,"in that brief time, mr. aghasi asked us about our prison conditions and the other prisoners in our ward."
14313,lawyer,we then went to an office together to sign and stamp the forms to officially appoint him as our lawyer.
14314,prisoners,"we had seen her talking to other lawyers and prisoners, and had caught her looking at us several times from across the room."
14315,lawyer,“is mr. aghasi your lawyer?” she asked.
14316,charges,“yes.” “could you tell me some more about your charges?
14317,prisoners,are you political prisoners?
14318,arrested,or were you arrested in the street disturbances?” “we are being prosecuted because we are christians.” “you are marziyeh and maryam!
14319,lawyer,"have you had access to a lawyer from the beginning?” “we have been in prison six months, and this is the first time we’ve talked with a lawyer.” “i’m very happy to see you in person."
14320,prisoners,i’m here today gathering the latest news on the cases of political prisoners.
14321,court,we heard it when we were in revolutionary court.” heydarifar was the prosecutor who had insisted we be executed.
14322,arrest,"“heydarifar, sobhani, and another man, saeed mortazavi, were implicated in the unlawful arrest and transfer of protestors."
14323,detention,some have said they were responsible for the torture and murder of prisoners at the kahrizak detention center.
14324,court,"the three people who were responsible for our court case, the three who had indicted us for apostasy and demanded we be executed, were now accused of torture and murder and would themselves be tried behind closed doors."
14325,court,this good news was tempered by the fact that replacing the three court officials would mean another delay in our case.
14326,guilty,these three were likely no more guilty than many others.
14327,illegal,"but the regime had to blame somebody in order to take the spotlight off the illegal elections, the public unrest, and the worldwide outcry demanding our release."
14328,power,"it was another renegade decision by the rulers, designed to stifle legitimate dissent and keep the powerful in power."
14329,prisoners,this also was a stark reminder that prisoners are not the only ones who are captive in iran.
14330,captive,everyone who lives under this repressive regime is—and will remain—a spiritual captive as long as these leaders maintain their iron grip.
14331,case,we tried not to think about the slow progress in our case and what might happen next.
14332,where,when many people were at the cultural center—where we weren’t allowed at first because we were unclean apostates and where we didn’t want to go later when mrs. rezaei insisted we be allowed to—we sat on our beds and knitted.
14333,ward,"after that, we went back to the ward to read some of the official newspapers (we were getting them again), listen to the radio news, and hold political discussions with other women who were interested."
14334,prisoners,word spread through the ward that some political prisoners from ward 209 were going to be transferred over to our hall.
14335,where,"then we went downstairs where they would be brought in, and as the door opened, there stood mahtab, fereshteh, and setare!"
14336,ward,"despite the fact that there were already thirty-five women crammed into room 1, we convinced mrs. ghaderi, the woman in charge of our ward, to send all four of the newcomers to our room."
14337,cell,"with all the arrests after the election, there were four or five people in each tiny cell, where three had been a crowd."
14338,inmates,"some of the new inmates there were prominent officials and politicians, now living under the same conditions as the people they once condemned."
14339,prisoners,"the flow of prisoners in the public wing had also picked up, and many women came and went in the ward."
14340,inmates,"maryam and i took on the task of greeting new prisoners, introducing them to other inmates and explaining the rules and traditions of the ward."
14341,arrested,"this gave us an opportunity to spend some time with arefeh, who had been arrested during a demonstration and held because her family members were mujahideen, even though she herself was not."
14342,freed,"she was curious about our faith, especially when she learned that we refused to renounce it in order to be freed."
14343,freedom,"she told us we were “silly” and added, “i think it is sheer stupidity that you two can buy your freedom by renouncing your beliefs and just walk out of this terrible place."
14344,cell,how could i ever deny something that is in every cell of my body?
14345,injustice,holding on to our beliefs means rejecting injustice and inequality.
14346,justice,is it not your pursuit of justice and your protest against oppression?
14347,where,"at first i thought it was my usual stomach trouble, but soon i was running down the hall to the toilet, where i vomited again and again."
14348,cell,"shirin and marziyeh came to help me back to the cell, but i was so weak i could hardly stand."
14349,case,they put me in a bed close to the door in case i had to go back to the toilet.
14350,guard,someone called a guard and after a few minutes convinced her to take me to the clinic.
14351,wall,"marziyeh wanted to go with me and argued with a guard while i leaned against the wall, barely able to stand."
14352,guard,the guard made me put on a chador and carefully cover my hair.
14353,guard,the guard went down the stairs in the direction of the clinic—fifty steps in all.
14354,guard,"“come on, hurry up!” the guard barked."
14355,guard,"“i can’t wait all night.” when we got downstairs, a guard told me to wait until he could coordinate with the doctor."
14356,ordered,"“quit pretending to be sick,” the guard ordered."
14357,guard,"“okay,” the guard said, “i know you’re not feeling well."
14358,guard,"just control yourself and hurry up.” when we reached the clinic, the doctor on duty gave me a quick glance and asked the guard what had happened."
14359,toilet,"“if  you need to get up, you can use that little toilet in the corner,” she said."
14360,where,"the next morning, my hand was swollen and sore where the iv needle had been inserted."
14361,ward,"“please take this needle out of my hand and let me go back to my ward,” i said."
14362,ward,"“my hand is completely numb, and i’m completely frozen.” shirin alam hooli and marziyeh were waiting for me in the ward."
14363,case,they had stayed awake all night in case i needed them and there was any way they could help.
14364,prisoners,"but in a place like evin prison, they mean even more because the prisoners have so little else to encourage them."
14365,court,she had been sentenced to death and was waiting for a final ruling from the court as to whether or not she would get a pardon.
14366,cell,"every time her name was called, we were afraid it could be a summons to the isolation cell where she would wait out the last day before her execution."
14367,ward,"marziyeh before maryam and i had gone to ward 209, i’d had a dream about shirin that i had never shared."
14368,interrogation,shirin went to 209 for further interrogation.
14369,sentence,"they said if she would answer their questions and betray her friends, they would commute her death sentence."
14370,situation,"“go ahead and execute me.” as long as she had been in prison and as often as she had been questioned, she sensed that her situation was different now."
14371,court,"she felt somehow—with the indefinite intuition of a person who knows something but can’t tell you how she knows it—that the court had already decided to execute her, and now was only trying to coax as much information out of her as possible before killing her."
14372,inmate,"if you’re released before i get back, leave it with another inmate to return to me.” she also gave us her books and other things to look after once she was transferred."
14373,interrogation,one reason for her latest interrogation was that a judge had been murdered and the kurds were suspected.
14374,prisoners,the authorities were grilling kurdish prisoners to see if they could get any clues in the case.
14375,executed,"a few days later, we saw the news that several kurds had been executed, including a boy."
14376,inmates,"the lights were out, and several inmates were watching tv."
14377,executed,"maryam said, “you know the boy who was executed today, don’t you?”  without looking up, shirin nodded and began to cry."
14378,inside,"she cried her eyes out, as if she’d hidden a huge sorrow inside until she couldn’t hide it anymore and now wanted to let it all go."
14379,imprisonment,"our unshakable kurdish heroine, who had endured months of torture and years of imprisonment without flinching, suddenly seemed broken and defeated."
14380,situation,“i’m sick and tired of the whole situation.
14381,executed,"i’ve seen so many people i love executed, lost so many of my friends at the hands of a merciless regime that has no compassion toward anyone, even a twenty-year-old boy."
14382,inmates,"as the weather turned cool, inmates without warm clothing began to suffer when we were all herded out into the courtyard for the morning roll call."
14383,prisoners,"most prisoners still went out before sunrise for muslim morning prayers, too, and everybody had to go out to register at 6:30."
14384,prisoners,it was announced that prisoners could receive new clothes from their families.
14385,inmates,"evidently, the idea was to make it harder for inmates to hide any sort of weapons or contraband."
14386,prisoners,"shamsi was in charge of room 2 and had become a friend, even though she had been a tough gang member on the outside and most prisoners were afraid of her."
14387,prisoners,"she also organized a system for bartering and buying clothes among the prisoners, and got clothes for the poorest prisoners, who couldn’t afford their own."
14388,prisoners,"in the wake of all the protests, the arrest of some of the judges, and the overcrowded conditions at evin, the guards became much stricter about prisoners going outside for morning roll call."
14389,prisoners,"in the past, old and sick prisoners had been excused."
14390,cell,"soraya, the huge woman with a cell and a shower of her own, never went out for roll call because it was so hard for her to walk."
14391,power,but now they began to enforce the rule—perhaps only because they knew they had the power to do it and because they knew it was uncomfortable and inconvenient.
14392,parole,"out of bed and into the prison yard for roll call!” anyone who disobeyed was denied access to the cultural center, lost her phone privileges, and wasn’t allowed visitors or parole."
14393,prisoners,"some of the sick prisoners shivered with cold just getting out of bed, never mind going outside."
14394,prisoners,"after that, everyone except for marziyeh and me and a few political prisoners had to face mecca and recite in arabic the omalyajib prayers."
14395,prisoners,"the guards were hoping to make the old and weak prisoners out to be the enemy, getting us to blame them instead of the guards for the inconvenience, and causing disagreements or even fights among the prisoners."
14396,situation,the bad situation was made even worse on days when we had to go back outside a second time for the guards to search our personal belongings or when they came through occasionally spraying disinfectant.
14397,ordered,"one morning, we had just come inside from another bone-chilling roll call and were eating breakfast when we were ordered back into the courtyard."
14398,ordered,"once we were all assembled, everyone who used the cultural center was ordered to go there, and everyone else was ordered to remain outside for the rest of the day."
14399,inmates,even the old and sick inmates were forced to obey.
14400,prisoners,"though a number of women went to the cultural center, the yard was packed with prisoners."
14401,prisoners,"after a while, some of the prisoners started sitting and lying on the ground, which made the crowding even worse."
14402,toilet,"soraya, whose kidney problems were familiar to everyone, called out that she had to go in and use the toilet."
14403,inside,the women in the cultural center had heard the yelling and were very happy to know we had stood together for even so small a thing as the chance to go back inside.
14404,prisoners,"the reason, we believed, was that the prison warden, mr. sedaghat, was under some kind of pressure to show that his prisoners were happy, well cared for, and being educated at his cultural center, where they were all behaving like nice muslim women."
14405,prisoners,"on top of everything else, the prisoners who were drug addicts were allowed into the cultural center for the first time, making it harder than ever to get a place there."
14406,ward,"everyone being out of the ward all day also wrecked our carefully planned schedule of shower times, which was essential since there were more than 150 women and five available showers."
14407,evin,any sort of coordinated prison protest was almost unknown in evin.
14408,execution,"on the eve of an execution or after a major event was reported in the news, our phones were cut off and we were locked in our cells until it was clear we had no plans to react."
14409,punishment,"there was also always the threat of punishment: we heard many stories of women considered troublemakers who were taken to a building next door and returned swollen, bruised, and bleeding."
14410,imprisonment,marziyeh and i had been banned from the cultural center since the beginning of our imprisonment.
14411,ward,"the next morning, when we were all ordered outside, marziyeh and i were the only ones who stayed in the ward."
14412,cell,"the guards came through, but they didn’t step inside our cell and didn’t notice us under our blankets."
14413,inmates,"after the other inmates returned, everybody wanted to know how we had managed to avoid the mandatory trip outside."
14414,inside,"when my turn came, mrs. rezaei ushered me inside."
14415,inmates,many other inmates suffer from various illnesses and disabilities that make it impossible for them to stand outside.
14416,confinement,"we would rather go to solitary confinement than tolerate this inhumane treatment.” “miss rostampour, i am as unhappy as you are about this new routine,” mrs. rezaei replied."
14417,prisoners,defiant prisoners will be sent to the security section.
14418,ward,"everybody in the ward is sick.” “i’m not happy about the situation either,” said mrs. rezaei, “but we have no other choice."
14419,cell,"i’m not the one who makes the decision.” i could see there was no point in continuing the conversation, so i thanked the warden and returned to my cell."
14420,authority,"though her complaint was justified, it was yet another example of her resisting authority, which looked bad, considering her case and the latest round of interrogations."
14421,prisoners,most prisoners were afraid of the guards and obeyed their every word.
14422,prisoners,"however, political prisoners like shirin were different."
14423,situation,but even some of the prison staff were now saying that the crowding situation was impossible and that the cultural center could no longer function.
14424,prisoners,prisoners needed to stand up for their rights.
14425,ward,reihaneh came from ward 209 to the public ward and was assigned to our room.
14426,case,we’d heard a lot about her case from radio and television.
14427,arrested,reihaneh was arrested after the elections for supporting them and being a member of the green movement.
14428,prisoners,she was transferred from 209 because the media were less likely to hear about her strike in the general ward than in the ward for political prisoners.
14429,torture,"when i first met her, she was pale and weak from physical and psychological torture; her malnutrition made her look even worse."
14430,law,"soon after reihaneh arrived, mrs. rezaei called her to the office and said that her hunger strike was breaking the law."
14431,prisoners,“did you know that christian prisoners are given asylum more easily now since you’ve been arrested and put in prison?” “how could this be related to us?” maryam asked.
14432,arrest,"“since your arrest, foreign governments are more willing to accept christians seeking asylum."
14433,situation,"they now believe that most of the christians in iran are under oppression, and that as soon as the iranian government finds out about them, their lives are in danger.” we had no idea our situation had made this kind of difference."
14434,pen,"the more we talked, the more interested reihaneh  became in christianity, until finally she put aside her pen and notebook and wanted to talk about faith."
14435,state,"she was arrested and accused of taking part in illegal rallies, disturbing the peace, propaganda against the state, and insulting the president."
14436,authorities,"because she had been a faithful supporter of mr. karroubi, the authorities forced her to confess that she was having an affair with him in order to fabricate a corruption case against him and tarnish his reputation."
14437,abuse,"reihaneh wanted to write a complete report of the plight of women in prison, an exposé of the abuse, corruption, and evil that made up the fabric of the iranian prison system."
14438,inmate,"with help from some other prisoners, i listed the names of every inmate, their charges, the year they were arrested, and all the details of their stories."
14439,prisoners,"reihaneh made notes about the terrible medical care, the bad food, and the predatory lesbianism that was so widespread—and that, before the security cameras were in place, had routinely led to the rape and beating of new prisoners."
14440,case,"in one especially gruesome case, a young woman had been raped in front of her child."
14441,ward,"the first step in reihaneh’s project was an article she wrote in the form of a letter to her interrogator in ward 209, which she titled, “doctor 209.” she read it to maryam and me."
14442,ward,my sister and i would visit while marziyeh stayed on the ward and rested in bed.
14443,ward,"the trip to the visitors’ center—the long wait at the women’s prison, the minibus ride, another wait at the visitors’ center, the ride back, and still another wait to be frisked before returning to ward 2—took even longer this time than usual."
14444,wall,"back at the women’s prison, in line waiting to be searched, i leaned against the office wall, exhausted from hours of standing."
14445,prisoners,the guards immediately ordered the prisoners to cover their hair completely.
14446,ward,"these guys must be from ward 209, i thought."
14447,case,"every day, we have to open and read letters about you and your case.” “you have to read letters about me?” “yes!"
14448,abuse,"perhaps this is another example of the abuse of human rights in this country—that you open and read other people’s mail.” “did you really expect us to give them to you so you could get more encouragement to defy us?” we don’t need to read the letters to be encouraged by them, i thought, my heart filled with joy."
14449,case,"“besides,” the man added gruffly, “unless the judge in your case permits it, we’re not allowed to give them to you."
14450,cellblock,"just like that, the two men left the cellblock."
14451,prisoners,"during the entire exchange, the rest of the prisoners waiting to be searched had been absolutely silent."
14452,prisoner,"“who were they?” “they’re from the security section of the ministry of intelligence.” to the other inmates, it was a case of famous security officials coming to visit a famous prisoner."
14453,inside,"inside, i was afraid of what could happen to me and marziyeh."
14454,torture,to torture us at last?
14455,ward,"when i got back to the ward, i learned that the men had come there earlier."
14456,prisoners,the men had instructed some other prisoners to get marziyeh up to talk with them.
14457,inmates,"no one, not even the inmates who had been at evin the longest, could remember officials waiting two hours to see anybody."
14458,power,"yet if they let us out while we still proclaimed our christian faith, they would lose face with the radicals who kept them in power."
14459,ward,"the next morning, after roll call and breakfast, mrs. mujahed, one of the ward monitors, ordered marziyeh and me to put on our chadors and report to mrs. rezaei’s office immediately."
14460,punishment,"at first, i assumed they were there to take me for punishment because of my behavior the day before."
14461,prisoners,"“because they give all sick prisoners the same medicine, no matter what’s wrong with them, and it has no effect whatsoever."
14462,authorities,"we’re not allowed to bring in our own medications from the outside.” as marziyeh and mr. ramezani continued to criticize the medical treatment, the other authorities left the office."
14463,case,"somewhere, someone was under pressure about our case, and the government was more desperate than ever to let us go without actually acquitting us."
14464,evin,i told her that evin receives dozens of letters for you every day that we have to read.
14465,inmates,"“they can call the security office directly and get permission to bring vitamins in.” marziyeh told him about the terrible food, the poor health of so many inmates—including herself—and the stupid early morning roll call."
14466,prisoners,"and the new rule is only making matters worse—the terrible health care combined with the requirement to go outside in the cold every morning is making the sick prisoners sicker, and the ones who aren’t sick yet are going to catch something.” “i know these problems very well,” mr. ramezani admitted."
14467,evin,"“but unfortunately, at evin, they have their own special rules."
14468,authority,canceling the morning schedule must come from a higher authority.
14469,ordered,“i’ve been ordered to come and see you.
14470,tortured,he was tortured and crucified.
14471,imprisoned,"the people who imprisoned you say this wasn’t so, but they’re making a huge mistake."
14472,tortured,"jesus was beaten, tortured, and crucified, and then he rose from the dead.” now i was even more shocked!"
14473,arrested,"we had been arrested, harassed, humiliated, and in prison for seven months for saying what this high prison official—seemingly feared and obeyed by everyone—was saying right in front of us in the office of the women’s warden."
14474,ward,"then our incredible conversation ended, and we went back to the ward, where our friends were waiting nervously for us."
14475,authorities,"we told them that everything was all right, that the authorities just wanted to know more about the letters we were getting from around the world."
14476,lawyer,"marziyeh a few days later, our new lawyer, mr. aghasi, came to visit us in prison again."
14477,court,"he said our court date would be coming up soon, and at last we would have a chance to defend ourselves."
14478,lawyer,he said it was not possible for a lawyer to do that.
14479,court,"within a week, maryam and i were summoned to the office and told to prepare for court the next day."
14480,bail,our friends assured us that this time around we would finally have our bail set and be released.
14481,case,others said because of all the publicity surrounding our case we would be  released unconditionally.
14482,court,"the next morning, we were up early, waited hours for the minibus to the court, and sat handcuffed together for the ride across town."
14483,court,they waved and shouted encouragement and followed us to the court building.
14484,court,"the last time we’d been to the revolutionary court, the judge had told us that if we didn’t change our story, our case would be transferred to bureau 15 for a final verdict."
14485,prisoners,"the judge there, who was also the judge in shirin alam hooli’s case, was famous for sentencing prisoners to death or to life in prison."
14486,building,"but when we entered the building this time, we saw from the sign that we were going into bureau 26."
14487,court,he comes from the family court and is a very kind man.” we stopped outside the courtroom door.
14488,court,i was only informed about your court summons yesterday.
14489,case,now i have fifteen minutes to read your file and prepare your case.
14490,sentence,we had been threatened with a sentence of death.
14491,lawyer,yet this was the first—and might be the only—time we would ever appear before a judge with our lawyer present.
14492,building,this was the first time they had been allowed in the building when we were there.
14493,courtroom,we waved good-bye to our sisters and passed through a very large courtroom into another one that was smaller.
14494,where,there was a raised desk at one end where the judge sat.
14495,justice,on the wall behind him was a large color photo of the scales of justice.
14496,justice,"looking up at the scales of justice, i knew that our faith and our lives were hanging in the balance."
14497,guilty,chapter 23 guilty as charged marziyeh our lawyer greeted the new judge.
14498,case,“but mr. larijani contacted me and asked me to follow your case.” this was incredible news!
14499,lawyer,our lawyer asked him why mr. larijani was involved.
14500,case,"“sources at the united nations have telephoned him and asked him to sort out this case as soon as possible.” in time, we learned who had brought our case to the attention of the united nations."
14501,situation,"“do you realize that, due to your perseverance, our enemies have taken advantage of the situation and run several negative campaigns against us?"
14502,case,maybe you don’t know what kind of people are using you and your case for their own objectives.” there had been a vigil in front of the iranian embassy in london supporting our release— another reminder that christians around the world were praying for us.
14503,case,"as good as this made us feel, the publicity made things trickier for the iranian judiciary, and the government’s anger grew, along with its frustration over not resolving our case."
14504,charges,"the judge said, “the charges of propaganda against the regime and insulting our sacred values are baseless."
14505,charges,"“therefore, i hereby acknowledge your acquittal from the charges of instigating propaganda against the system and insulting our sacred values.” just like that, without a statement or a word of testimony from us, we were cleared of these serious charges after months of interrogation, humiliation, and judicial stalemate."
14506,charge,“now we come to the charge of apostasy.
14507,charge,this charge remains valid.
14508,sentence,"and as you know, the sentence for this crime is the death penalty for men and life imprisonment with labor for women.” the judge looked at our lawyer."
14509,sentence,"“i’m sure you’ve already briefed your clients about this issue.” “yes, i have.” we had been told repeatedly that the maximum sentence possible for us was death."
14510,executed,we knew of plenty of women who had been executed in iran.
14511,executed,"however, this was also the second time we’d heard that we could not be executed because we were women."
14512,court,"and as maryam had reminded me the night before when our court date was announced over the loudspeaker, today, october 7, was the four-year anniversary of that day."
14513,inside,"i had never wanted to be baptized inside a church, but instead wanted the ceremony in a natural setting like the one in my dream."
14514,courtroom,"and though i was very afraid as i sat in this islamic courtroom with my life on the line, it was just as easy to say yes now."
14515,death,i would willingly follow jesus to a new life or to death.
14516,question,"in answering the question before the judge, i explained my faith in christ and my personal relationship with him."
14517,prisoner,the judge was visibly startled by such a bold statement from a prisoner whose freedom seemed so close at hand.
14518,court,"aghasi, you may present your defense to the court in the matter of apostasy.” “my clients respect other religions in the same way they respect their own,” mr. aghasi said hopefully."
14519,charges,mr. aghasi was doing his best to have us acquitted of the apostasy charges.
14520,lawyer,"“judge, our lawyer is wrong!” i felt all eyes in the room now fixed upon me."
14521,freed,"if we had wanted to be freed by denying our faith, we could have gotten out of prison months ago."
14522,sentences,"“we have to change some of the last sentences.” “that’s fine,” judge pirabbasi said."
14523,charge,i’ve already told you what to expect if the charge of apostasy is proven.
14524,lawyer,"i will write that you say, ‘we believe in jesus christ.’” our lawyer’s face was still red as a beet."
14525,charges,"if they have reached this conclusion and believe in what they say, then they will have to pay the price for it.” maryam and i stepped forward to sign some papers acquitting us of the political charges and reaffirming our belief in jesus christ."
14526,court,i have acquitted you of the political charges brought against you by the court of revolution.
14527,court,"but with regard to the apostasy charge, it must be dealt with by another court, which is designed to look into these particular cases.” “couldn’t you handle this issue in your court, too, instead of referring it to another judge?” mr. aghasi inquired."
14528,charges,"“you can check the law, but i’m sure i have dealt appropriately with the first charges, yet can be no further help on the second charge.” maryam asked the judge if we could have the letters that had been sent to us."
14529,arrest,"we also asked about our laptops, identity papers, and other items that had been confiscated on the day of our arrest."
14530,court,"“everything is probably at the gisha police station where you were arrested, or in bureau 2 where you came to court before.” he called a clerk and instructed him to see if any of our belongings were there in bureau 26."
14531,courtroom,the clerk left the courtroom and came back in a moment with two bibles.
14532,courtroom,"the judge walked out of the courtroom, leaving us alone with mr. aghasi."
14533,defendants,you are the first defendants ever to deny their lawyer’s statement.
14534,court,“he has been recently transferred to the court of revolution and is responsible for the political cases.
14535,case,i wish that today he would have tied up your case file so that the apostasy judge could deliver his ruling.
14536,court,"unfortunately, now your case will be referred to the court of justice.” the judge came back into the courtroom, and to our surprise he sat at the table with us and ordered his clerk to serve us tea."
14537,case,mr. aghasi said again to mr. pirabbasi that he wished the judge could resolve our case.
14538,sentence,"“in serious cases that normally end with a sentence of life imprisonment or death, this court, the court of revolution, does not get involved,” the judge said."
14539,court,"“those cases go to the court of justice, where there is a three-judge panel."
14540,evin,"he asked about the conditions inside evin prison, especially the medical care."
14541,ward,"“thank you, but i don’t think the prison staff would allow us to take this bottle into our ward,” i said."
14542,courtroom,"we took the bottle and the note and left the courtroom to find our sisters, who had waited outside."
14543,court,"when our sisters saw us going to the yard, they walked toward us, but before they got to us, a woman from the court building yelled at our soldiers."
14544,cell,"why aren’t they in the holding cell?” she made us go into that dreadful room, where flies buzzed around patches of dried vomit."
14545,situation,"the smell made me want to add my own vomit to the situation, but somehow i was able to control myself."
14546,prisoners,"our appetites gone, we gave our sandwiches to other prisoners waiting for the bus."
14547,evin,"marziyeh after an hour and a half wait, the bus took us back to evin."
14548,court,"during the ride, i played over in my mind what had just happened in court."
14549,death,now i’m under the threat of death.
14550,situation,sometimes god puts us in a difficult situation and tries us.
14551,court,"“when you are in fear, will you still be true?” i decided in court to follow god even if it kills me."
14552,ward,everyone in ward 2 was anxious to know what had happened.
14553,bail,"“maybe they’ll offer bail,” one of them said."
14554,bail,maryam and i agreed that we’d never accept bail now.
14555,imprisoned,the regime should apologize to us because they’d arrested and imprisoned us without reason.
14556,bail,"“if you’re offered bail, you should praise the lord,” a voice in the crowded room declared."
14557,power,"we can’t do it, but god can show his power.” they were astonished at our story of how the judge had served us tea and given us perfume."
14558,court,"our comments in court made big news, though we never knew how word of our statements before judge pirabbasi could spread so fast."
14559,where,"maryam a few days later, marziyeh and i were called to the prison office, where a grumpy guard named izadi was on duty."
14560,prisoners,"she often swore at prisoners, especially when she was talking on the loudspeaker."
14561,authority,"put your chadors on properly!” maybe we had a few stray hairs showing, but mostly she was trying to show off her authority over us."
14562,prisoners,"“these items are for these two prisoners,” he said calmly but with authority to izadi."
14563,guard,"izadi left us with mr. ramezani and a guard, closing the door behind her."
14564,situation,he and i have been ordered to help you out of your situation.
14565,freed,“this person says you will soon be freed and then he will personally tell you about his message.
14566,cell,"when we asked him to explain more clearly, he said, “i cannot tell you everything right now.” his cell phone rang."
14567,convicted,would we have been convicted on different charges?
14568,freed,"“now your prison term is over, and you must be freed,” he went on."
14569,freedom,“this man lives in a provincial city and is traveling to tehran to see you.” “is he that confident about our freedom?” i asked.
14570,guard,“he surely is!” mr. ramezani told the guard in the room that he must not say anything about our conversation because it would cause trouble.
14571,guard,"“rest assured that i will not tell anyone,” the guard answered."
14572,prisoner,our visitor stepped out of the room for a few minutes to see another prisoner who knew him and had heard he was in the office.
14573,prisoners,"while our guard was alone with us, he asked, “are you the two christian prisoners who get all the mail?” “yes, we are."
14574,authorities,"several soldiers open and read them, and then report the contents to the authorities.” “what do the letters say?” “many of them are in english, and most of them say the same thing."
14575,prisoners,"i think, in any case, he will order that you get the letters after you’ve been released, because there are so many of them, and prisoners aren’t allowed to receive letters anyway.” by the time we returned to ward 2, our meeting with mr. ramezani had already made headlines."
14576,inmates,"some of the inmates remained jealous of the attention we received, yet they all  wanted to know about our discussion and what would happen next."
14577,prisoners,we heard later that our visitor had stayed to talk with several other women prisoners after we left so as not to raise suspicions that he had come again only to see us.
14578,ward,"when we reported to the office, a guard from ward 209 was waiting to blindfold us and take us to that miserable place."
14579,court,it was very unusual for prisoners to return to 209 after their cases had been heard by the revolutionary court.
14580,sentence,fereshteh told us that it usually meant a prisoner’s sentence was either going to be extended or applied.
14581,building,"marziyeh and i walked to the other building, peeking out from under the bottom of our blindfolds to watch our escort’s feet as usual, and waited in the hallway facing the wall."
14582,wall,"there must be some mistake!” i was taken alone into a room, with marziyeh left facing the wall in the hallway."
14583,guard,"after the guard had left the room and shut the door behind him, a voice told me to remove my blindfold."
14584,sentence,didn’t you know that those who renounce islam are considered apostates and their sentence is death?” “i met with jesus christ.
14585,ward,“you were also our guests here in ward 209 for a while.” something familiar about him registered in my mind—i knew his voice!
14586,imprisoned,"so they arrested and imprisoned us just for fun, and christian converts don’t really face the death penalty?"
14587,case,"obviously, he was trying very hard to offset the mess others had made of our case with some syrupy language."
14588,power,"“if you need anything, all you have to do is ask.” mr. dolatabadi smiled and said, “i have the power to let you go free or not."
14589,freedom,"i believe it is the lord’s will that marziyeh and i should be in prison, and that our freedom lies in his hands alone."
14590,power,"of course, we don’t like staying in prison and we would rather be free, but we prefer to wait for the lord’s decision on the matter.” i was irritated at mr. dolatabadi’s attitude and his remark that he had the power to release us."
14591,power,it reminded me of pontius pilate’s claim that he had the power to save jesus.
14592,case,"by the way, have you ever been to rome?” “no, never.” “then why is the vatican involved in your case?"
14593,imprisoned,"however, it’s only natural for the vatican to get involved with our case because we have been imprisoned on charges of being christians and believing in jesus.” (we never learned any more about the vatican’s reported involvement.)"
14594,execution,"“in any case,” mr. dolatabadi said, “you must have known that to convert to christianity and then promote it the way you have in this country is quite dangerous and subjects you to  execution."
14595,prisoners,the men offered us sweets and treated us like honored guests rather than prisoners threatened with death.
14596,case,"clearly, the vatican’s involvement had brought the publicity in our case, and the need to resolve it, to a new level on an international scale."
14597,prisons,"mr. dolatabadi asked lots of questions about conditions inside evin—food, medical care, our general health—as if he, the city’s chief prosecutor, had no idea what went on in the city’s prisons."
14598,prisoner,"i started telling him about the ridiculous rule requiring every prisoner to go outside for the morning roll call, regardless of her condition."
14599,injustice,"like everyone else we had talked to lately, he was scrambling for a way to avoid an international crisis by persuading us to change our story about what had happened to us— forget the mistreatment and relentless interrogations; overlook the inhumane treatment and injustice; believe that our mistreatment at the hands of mr. sobhani, mr. haddad, our anonymous interrogators, and everyone else was because of their personal actions and opinions, not because they were acting in the name of the kindly, compassionate, and accommodating iranian regime."
14600,ward,"after mr. dolatabadi finished his speech, marziyeh and i were blindfolded and taken back to our ward."
14601,case,"when they found out we had met with mr. dolatabadi, they were convinced it was a prelude to our release and the final settlement of our case."
14602,freed,"we began to think they might be right, that we actually were going to be freed soon."
14603,ward,"within days, we found ourselves blindfolded once again, escorted to ward 209, and seated before mr. dolatabadi and his white-haired companion."
14604,trial,"“i have agreed to release you on bail until your trial begins,” the chief prosecutor said."
14605,bail,"“you will be released after posting bail of 200 million tomans [about $100,000] each.” “we don’t have anyone who can help us raise that much money,” marziyeh said."
14606,charges,"“besides, after nearly nine months in prison under these charges, we want to see our case resolved."
14607,charges,"we think the case should be settled instead of releasing us on bail while still under charges.” “you wouldn’t actually have to pay the bail,” the older man said."
14608,bail,"i can call them now and they can go straight to the courthouse to register their names on your behalf, and their guarantee will serve as your bail.” “i have agreed to your freedom,” mr. dolatabadi added."
14609,ward,"we were blindfolded and left in the corridor, waiting for our escort to take us back to the public ward."
14610,prisoners,"the sight of the food amazed the guards in the ward 2 office, who were used to seeing prisoners return from 209 exhausted and worried, and sometimes bruised and bleeding."
14611,ward,"they didn’t want us to go into the ward with our food, so they sent us into the kitchen to eat it."
14612,prisoners,marziyeh and i split one container of food and gave the other to some other prisoners  who were in the room.
14613,cell,"after we’d eaten and were walking to our cell, amiri, the guard who had been so mean to me the night i got food poisoning, called out to me."
14614,evin,"mr. dolatabadi’s brief phone call had ushered in a new world inside evin prison, at least for the moment."
14615,ward,"marziyeh the very next day, our names were called again to go to ward 209."
14616,freedom,"instead of fearing for our safety, our friends were now convinced this summons was moving us yet another step closer to freedom."
14617,prisoner,"parvaneh, the prisoner who made a little money as the cleaner of our room, asked for our autographs to prove she had shared a cell with two such famous people."
14618,wall,"others teased us good-naturedly by shouting, “what’s on the take-out menu today?” and, “who’s coming to apologize to you today?” we were blindfolded and taken to 209, where we waited in the corridor, facing the wall, until we were led into a room."
14619,freed,"“i hear you are being freed,” he said."
14620,case,"i’m not sure whether you believe me or not, but i want you to know that my colleagues and i were heavily involved in pursuing your case and did our best to get you released."
14621,freedom,“don’t you ever think that it was international pressure or the church that secured your freedom.
14622,arrest,"you were just unlucky that your arrest coincided with the nowruz holidays, and after that we had the election and its aftermath."
14623,case,all these events delayed the processing of your case.
14624,bail,"who is going to pay your bail or stand as your guarantor?” “it’s not clear yet,” maryam said."
14625,freed,"“our lawyer is looking into it.” “well, god willing, you will soon be freed!"
14626,illegal,"if in the past, as you say, you didn’t know that such things as promoting the message of jesus and his prophecies are illegal in this country, now you know it very well."
14627,freed,“i hear the chief prosecutor has been to see you and you’re about to be freed.” “yes.
14628,trial,"he has agreed to a guarantor for our bail until our trial.” “well, thank god for that."
14629,freedom,i also want you to know i am very happy about your freedom.” we promised to contact him later.
14630,charge,"the guard standing nearby said, “so you are to be set free?” “yes.” “what was your charge?” “believing in jesus christ.” “well, thank god for that.” she and another guard stared in amazement."
14631,prisoner,it was probably  the first time the head of the security section had called a prisoner to congratulate her on her release.
14632,prisoner,"when maryam told another prisoner that mr. ramezani had called us, the woman joked, “now it’s president ahmadinejad’s turn to come visit you in prison!” while the final chapters of our story were playing out, other prisoners were hearing news both good and bad about their charges."
14633,case,"reihaneh’s case was also in bureau 26 with judge pirabbasi, who had been so kind to us."
14634,courtroom,the judge had encouraged her to end her hunger strike and had offered her something to eat in his courtroom.
14635,bail,she was soon released on bail and joyfully reunited with her family.
14636,freedom,"“our freedom must not be the end of our friendship with you,” i said."
14637,freed,you’ve promised to get in touch with us whenever you are freed.
14638,prisoners,"no matter how long it takes, we will be waiting to hear from you and celebrate your freedom.” after the comings and goings of prisoners over the months, our closest remaining friend was shirin alam hooli."
14639,execution,"hearing of her friend’s execution had been a terrible blow, and now we, her best remaining friends, were about to leave her."
14640,bail,the last big hurdle seemed to be arranging the bail guarantee.
14641,situation,we were on the phone to our sisters every day working out the situation.
14642,bail,"because they had no personal wealth, they had found two well-to-do businessmen who owned property and were willing to guarantee our bail."
14643,court,"but this time mr. dolatabadi’s secretary told them they could come back and see mr. ghotbi, another judge in the revolutionary court, and he would handle our case."
14644,lawyer,"he said that, as an alternative, our lawyer, mr. aghasi, could sign our guarantee."
14645,bail,"under the circumstances, they agreed to take the risk, even though they wouldn’t be able to pay the bail if it became necessary."
14646,law,"“of course, you are aware that i am allowed by our religious law to cut you in half with a sword right now,” he fumed at them, his voice rising."
14647,evin,"“but i prefer to leave it to the law to decide.” he explained that he would now send a letter to evin, instructing the warden to set us free."
14648,trial,"the charge of apostasy was still pending, but at least we could be on the outside until the trial."
14649,prisoners,"as we had learned from following our friends’ cases, it often happens in iranian courts that prisoners are released on bail but the charges are never settled or dropped."
14650,case,"that way, the accused still have a case open against them and can be rearrested on the flimsiest pretext."
14651,evin,"every night, we wondered whether this would be our last night in evin prison."
14652,evin,never in our lives would we form friendships as deep and rich as the ones god had blessed us with behind the high and foreboding walls of evin prison.
14653,evin,the word evin wasn’t strange to us anymore; it was now as familiar as our own names.
14654,wall,"i wonder if i’ll ever see the whole sky again, instead of only a piece of it framed by a window or a prison wall.” she looked around the courtyard with the sad stump where the lone tree had been, the wet ground, the numbingly familiar walls."
14655,case,i wished that shirin’s case could be settled before we left.
14656,injustice,but we were united forever in standing against the injustice that has destroyed the body and soul of the iranian people.
14657,dictatorship,"our greatest wish, our fondest dream, was that iran would shake off the chains of its evil rulers and that the people of iran would be delivered from injustice and dictatorship."
14658,ward,"only god knew whether he was finished with us in ward 2, room 1 of iran’s most feared and brutal prison."
14659,inmates,"after breakfast, when inmates usually left for the cultural center, no one on the ward wanted to go because they were afraid to miss our departure."
14660,prisoners,"but because prisoners were never released before noon, we encouraged everybody to go to their morning activities."
14661,freed,if only they could all be freed before we were.
14662,freed,“what do you feel like now that you’re being freed?” she asked.
14663,freedom,think about your freedom and don’t worry about me.
14664,freedom,"“your freedom papers have arrived,” she shouted as she threw herself into my arms."
14665,ward,"a few minutes later, our names were announced, and the whole ward burst into cheers."
14666,ward,now friends from all over the ward swarmed into our room to hug us and wish us well.
14667,prisoner,"then the women began to sing the song we sang whenever a political prisoner was released: “go, go, and never come back!” i heard the sound of a plate shattering on the floor in our honor."
14668,ward,"there was nothing left to do but walk through the corridor and out of the ward, yet marziyeh and i could scarcely bring ourselves to leave."
14669,cell,"we carried our things from the cell into the corridor, still hugging and kissing everyone we could reach."
14670,prisoners,"at the end of the hall, the guards told the other prisoners they couldn’t walk any farther."
14671,freedom,how we would have given anything to take shirin with us on those few final steps to freedom.
14672,evin,we moved through a series of checkpoints to a spot near the main gate of evin prison.
14673,gate,"the guard who walked us to the gate was one we had seen many times before, though we’d spoken very little."
14674,gate,"we will pray to jesus that your problem will be solved.” a sentry led us to the main gate, opened it, and ushered us through."
14675,prisoners,"usually when prisoners are released, all their friends and family are there to welcome them."
14676,case,"in our case, someone made sure there was no public display or celebration."
14677,evin,"though my body was free, my soul and spirit were still with our precious friends suffering terrible injustice inside evin prison."
14678,situation,this thought made it impossible for me to enjoy our new situation.
14679,arrested,"our sisters had cleaned our apartment, except for our bedrooms, straightening the mess the basiji had made the day they arrested us."
14680,evin,"from the window in our apartment, we could see the walls of evin prison in the distance."
14681,ward,"these were the dishes we’d dreamed of for months, yet all we could think of now was our friends back in ward 2 choking down that horrible slop."
14682,inmates,"when prisoners leave, the other inmates ask for their phone numbers in order to keep in touch."
14683,question,"their first question during the first phone call is always, “what did you eat?” our meal made us wish somebody would call."
14684,evin,the moment would have been so much more enjoyable if we’d had our evin friends on the line to celebrate with us.
14685,arrested,it was as if we wanted to run away from the home where we were arrested and which we hadn’t seen for nine months.
14686,dictatorship,"the difference was that now we watched the people and thought of the terrible burden they live under, whether they know it or not—a ruthless dictatorship based on oppressive laws that in the blink of an eye can rob anyone of their freedom, or even their life."
14687,ward,"i could see their faces, smell the ward, feel the close, unhealthy atmosphere of the place—and i missed it so much!"
14688,case,"although we had been released, our apostasy case was still pending."
14689,police,"by now, we could spot the intelligence police at a distance whenever we went out."
14690,prisoners,"we spent far more time with our new friends—fellow prisoners who had also been released, and those still awaiting their fate behind the walls of evin."
14691,trial,"she, too, was still awaiting trial and being shadowed by the security police."
14692,arrest,she and her mother were also under house arrest and forbidden from traveling outside the country.
14693,arrest,"for two years before our arrest, maryam and i had hosted two home churches and given away new testaments."
14694,evin,"for nine months in evin prison, we had spent every day praising jesus and proclaiming his gospel."
14695,arrest,the good news was that we heard indirectly of many cases where news of our arrest and our defiance had led others to christ.
14696,arrest,"as our elderly apartment manager explained to me, “after learning about your arrest and your refusal to renounce your faith, i wanted to know what about christianity could be so powerful that you would sacrifice your lives rather than renounce it."
14697,evin,"he said the mysterious man who had dreamed about us, foretold our freedom, and sent him to evin to visit us in the first place wanted to meet us."
14698,evin,here was a man whose name struck fear in  the hearts of all the guards and officials at evin prison cooking lunch for us in his own home.
14699,prisoners,"after talking with her for a few minutes, we deduced that her husband had helped many other prisoners deal with unfair conditions."
14700,transferred,"a few weeks later, we heard he had been transferred to a job in the provinces."
14701,court,we wrote a letter to the revolutionary court and delivered it in person to the clerk.
14702,court,he told us that the court would tell our lawyer where our things were and how to get them back.
14703,court,"he recommended we not pursue the matter ourselves, because some court officials were very angry that we were out of prison."
14704,court,"eventually, the court told mr. aghasi that our property was at the police station."
14705,charge,"we went to the station with mr. aghasi and were sent downstairs to speak to a bureaucratic drone named mr. yazdi, who was in charge of the storage section."
14706,court,"when our lawyer showed him the letter from the court, mr. yazdi exploded in anger."
14707,lawyer,“who told you to bring a lawyer down here?
14708,prisoners,"there’s no reason for you ladies to bring one with you!” more likely, he was concerned that mr. aghasi knew the law and wouldn’t allow him to take advantage of us as he usually did with ex-prisoners trying to get their property back."
14709,court,"he finally calmed down, and we convinced him we weren’t there to make trouble, but that the court had instructed us to come to him for our property."
14710,lawyer,"do not bring your lawyer to this place again.” a few days later, we got a call that our property was ready for pickup."
14711,custody,"during our wait, we happened to see the officer who had taken us into custody the day we were arrested."
14712,case,we explained that our case had attracted international publicity and this put pressure on the regime to set us free.
14713,charges,"they must have kept you in prison on phony charges, too."
14714,prisoners,"but in so doing, he helped us spread the message of jesus among the neediest people—the prisoners of evin— and gave us worldwide publicity we never could have gotten on our own.” the young officer could only shake his head as he walked away."
14715,court,"chapter 26 the day will come maryam as we waited for a ruling from the court, several of our friends got news about their own charges."
14716,sentenced,"setare was sentenced to five years, along with her brother."
14717,sentenced,"arefeh, who had been arrested at a post-election demonstration where her cousin was beaten, was sentenced to four years."
14718,locked,she couldn’t believe she would be locked up for four years for one day of protesting.
14719,sentence,"her lawyer had already appealed her sentence, and marziyeh and i tried to cheer her up with the hope that the appeal would be granted."
14720,sentence,"unfortunately, at best it would reduce her sentence by only a year, and three years was still terribly unjust."
14721,imprisonment,"one of the best stories was from our friend fereshteh, who had suffered with multiple sclerosis in ward 209 and was under the threat of life imprisonment or death."
14722,sentence,her sentence was set at two years because of her medical problems.
14723,freed,"mahtab, sousan, and rozita had all been freed, though their cases were still pending."
14724,freedom,learning of their freedom was the best news we’d heard since our own release.
14725,law,"mahtab told us about going every week with her father-in-law to visit her fiancé, who was still in prison in another city."
14726,case,it was a joy to see the family content—though a shadow remained over them because her case was still awaiting a verdict.
14727,evin,our friends still in evin were in our thoughts every day.
14728,inside,the smallest gift or expression of kindness is vastly more meaningful inside prison than on the outside.
14729,prisoners,"a couple of months after our release, as the new year’s holiday approached, marziyeh and i went to the market and bought a whole armload of clothes and gave them to relatives of the prisoners to deliver for us."
14730,arrested,the coming of nowruz marked a full year since we had been arrested; we had observed the holiday at evin just after we arrived.
14731,ward,she called to say she’d been interrogated in ward 209 yet again.
14732,execution,"they said if she would give them a list of her friends, maybe they could cancel her execution decree."
14733,ordered,they ordered her to make a video interview to be broadcast on television.
14734,interrogation,the stress of her interrogation had aggravated her physical problems.
14735,authorities,"when we told her she should go to the doctor, she said she had told the authorities she needed new glasses, but they had ignored her."
14736,sentence,"shirin called later to say that her brother, esa, had learned that her sentence would be life in prison."
14737,executed,“i would rather be executed.
14738,prisoners,all the political prisoners have been moved together in room 6; they argue politics constantly.
14739,freed,"“i think i will be freed soon,” she said."
14740,sentence,"but i won’t stay in here forever.” the commutation of her sentence to life in prison, plus the worldwide response to her letter, made us hopeful that in time her prison term might be reduced even more."
14741,cell,"he called my cell phone, so agitated and distraught he could scarcely speak."
14742,sentence,"she told us you said the decree was changed by the judge and her sentence had been commuted!” “that never happened, but i didn’t have the heart to tell her."
14743,police,"to keep the police from overhearing us, we picked him up in haft-e-tir square and drove around while we talked."
14744,court,"“judge salavati has confirmed the death decree in the appeals court,” he said, frantic with fear."
14745,evin,“the written copy of his decision will be sent to evin.
14746,prisoners,"shirin will have it in a few days.” judge salavati, known as “the killing judge,” was famous for sentencing prisoners to death."
14747,sentence,"one woman wrote to mr. dolatabadi, the head of the judiciary who had come to see us near the end of our sentence."
14748,case,we prepared a summary of shirin’s life and the facts in her case to distribute to human rights organizations.
14749,sentence,"the first time marziyeh and i talked with her after she learned the truth about her sentence, we could scarcely speak."
14750,evin,"as soon as my soul leaves my body, i’ll fly to your house because it’s the closest to evin prison."
14751,evin,"“promise me that when i die you’ll be waiting for my body outside evin,” she admonished."
14752,tortured,"we told her to write a letter explaining that she had been tortured and drugged, and that her old video “confession” was nothing but a string of lies."
14753,evin,we asked our friends still in evin to keep a close watch on her and comfort her as much as they could.
14754,court,"marziyeh after the nowruz holidays, we received word that our court appearance on charges of apostasy would be held on april 13, 2010, at 9:00 a.m. to our surprise, the hearing would be in the provincial court of justice, where we had not been before."
14755,sentences,"this was where many heavy sentences were handed down, including executions."
14756,inside,we passed the word to our friends on the inside that we might be rejoining them soon.
14757,court,"we also packed suitcases to take to court with us, just in case."
14758,courthouse,"on the appointed morning, we arrived at the courthouse."
14759,building,"leaving our luggage in the car, we stepped inside an enormous building with a seemingly endless maze of hallways and  security forces everywhere."
14760,charge,mr. aghasi explained that we would appear today before a five-judge panel that would make the final ruling on our apostasy charge.
14761,courtroom,"when we walked into the courtroom, a huge room filled with empty chairs, it took our breath away."
14762,charges,"at last, the chief judge intoned a prayer to allah and ordered the charges against us to be read."
14763,illegal,"it was a long statement charging us with apostasy, promoting christianity, and possessing bibles and illegal cds."
14764,punishment,"it accused us of being apostates who must be dealt with according to islamic law and asked the court to hand down the “maximum possible punishment for promoting christianity.” as everyone in the room knew, the maximum possible punishment was execution."
14765,court,"aghasi, write down your clients’ defense and hand it to the court.” we watched as our lawyer started writing the words that would determine our future."
14766,lawyer,“does each of you accept the defense your lawyer has given?” we said we did.
14767,lawyer,"the angry young judge interjected, “at least let the lawyer read their defense so we can all hear it.” by this time, all four associate judges had sour expressions on their faces."
14768,court,"“sign this statement and these forms saying you were in court, and you are free to go home.” they were not acquittal documents, only papers saying we had appeared before the panel."
14769,sentenced,"but if you ever step into this courtroom again, you will surely be sentenced to death.” after we signed, the chief justice said that our lawyer would be informed of the final disposition of our case."
14770,courtroom,"outside the courtroom, mr. aghasi could barely contain his joy."
14771,acquitted,"“this means you will be acquitted,” he said."
14772,case,finally your case will be resolved and you will be truly free.
14773,arrest,"i never imagined it would be this easy.” for the first time since our arrest, we did indeed feel truly free."
14774,court,"although we still didn’t have an official ruling, our lawyer had no doubt that this was our final court appearance."
14775,arrest,"though we had been physically released from evin prison, we were still held captive by a regime that monitored our every move and could arrest us again at any time."
14776,charges,"even without charges pending against us, the basiji would never be far away."
14777,captive,"they were captive in iran, just as we still were."
14778,killing,"if religious extremists took matters into their own hands, the government would probably secretly reward them for killing us."
14779,arrest,"practically speaking, until our case was settled we were still under undeclared house arrest."
14780,sentence,"we wanted to see them squirm, humbled before an international audience by reversing a shameful death sentence for people who stood firm on their principles."
14781,evin,our friends from evin called to hear the news and to celebrate with us.
14782,case,we also kept up with shirin alam hooli’s case.
14783,court,four different activist groups were now publicizing her case and trying to bring pressure on the court to show leniency and compassion.
14784,cell,"maryam at breakfast some days later, marziyeh’s cell phone rang."
14785,executed,she listened without speaking— she didn’t have to say a word; her face told the story: shirin alam hooli had been executed before dawn that morning.
14786,court,"even the sadistic animals of the iranian court system would not execute a woman without a final decree from the court, would they?"
14787,evin,"while marziyeh began tracing the story on the internet, i took a taxi to evin prison."
14788,gate,"there was no commotion or scene of any kind outside the gate, only the usual two sentries."
14789,gate,marziyeh met me at the prison gate.
14790,taken,"on saturday night, she had taken a bath and put on the new clothes we’d sent her for new year’s."
14791,prisoners,she’d gone to visit the prisoners in room 2.
14792,guard,"she was laughing and drinking tea when a guard came and took her away, locking the door behind her."
14793,confinement,shirin spent her last night in solitary confinement.
14794,execution,none of her friends knew she was being taken away to execution.
14795,state,"shirin was one of five kurds hanged together on sunday, may 9, 2010, all convicted of belonging to the pkk, the kurdistan workers party, which leads the struggle to form a kurdish  state from parts of iran, turkey, and iraq."
14796,taken,"at last, her brother learned that her body and those of four other kurds had already been taken to a cemetery."
14797,inside,marziyeh went inside to retrieve them.
14798,injustice,why is there so much injustice in the world?
14799,court,"a guard at the cemetery said that, yes, the bodies of the executed prisoners were there, but no one could see them without written permission from the court."
14800,evin,"the next morning, we went back to the main gate at evin prison, where a large crowd had gathered."
14801,executed,news had spread that the regime refused to release any of the bodies of the kurds who had been executed.
14802,court,"about noon, the relatives of another executed prisoner arrived and said the court had refused to release the bodies because they were afraid of a protest or riot."
14803,prisoners,"instead, they gave cards to the dead prisoners’ relatives and told them they could present them at the cemetery and collect the bodies later, when the threat of a riot had passed."
14804,executed,the sisters and brothers of farzad and shirin and the others live on.” the lawyer for the executed kurds had been in prison himself.
14805,court,"now he stood before the crowd, and with tears in his eyes said that the court would notify him when they could pick up the bodies, and he would tell everyone."
14806,evin,the phones at evin had been cut off the morning after the executions.
14807,guard,"they had learned of shirin’s fate when a guard came in the morning after and said flatly, “she’s dead.” nothing more."
14808,executed,the executed kurds were secretly buried in an unmarked mass grave to avoid a public protest or family reaction.
14809,evin,"we had shirin’s diary, which was smuggled out of evin and given to us."
14810,death,"on may 22, 2010, less than two weeks after shirin’s death, we left iran, not knowing when or if we would ever be back."
14811,evin,we had promised our friends in evin that we would wave as we passed overhead.
14812,evin,"far below, most of the nation was still asleep—our suffering friends in their crowded evin cells, our christian brothers and sisters in their homes, and our many secret supporters  throughout the country."
14813,imprisonment,"we lived in antalya for nearly a year, traveling back and forth to the un office in ankara and writing the journals of our imprisonment that are the basis for this book."
14814,authorities,"we sat through many sessions of intense questioning, first by turkish authorities and then by people at the un."
14815,arrested,"they doubted we were christians, that we had been arrested, and that the iranian government had backed down and dismissed the charges against us."
14816,police,"the turkish police were unexpectedly harsh, though not as difficult as the un officials who questioned us."
14817,police,"our first un interviews were with turkish nationals who worked for the un, but who, like the police, clearly resented the fact that we had “converted” from islam."
14818,where,"in god’s timing, our visas were approved and we moved to atlanta, where we established a good relationship with world relief and began our new lives."
14819,captive,"we wanted to tell the world about being captive in iran ourselves, but even more so, about a whole nation being held captive."
14820,death,"if anyone had told us five years ago that by now we would have spent more than nine months in an iranian prison, been threatened with death, had our story told around the world, written a book (in english, no less), and moved to atlanta, georgia, we would have said they were crazy."

14823,evin,"after they were freed from evin prison, it would have been both easy and understandable if they had gone to a safe, quiet place to rebuild their lives away from public view."
14824,court,"for eight months, they wrote, recalling every friendship, every court appearance, every emotion, every key event of their prison experience."
14825,execution,"it was very painful to revisit the terrible things that had happened—the shocking injustices, the abuses of the system, the stories of torture and execution of women who had become treasured friends."
14826,evin,"as difficult as it was to write about what they had seen and experienced, they eventually filled 1,900 handwritten pages with the history of their ministry and their time in evin prison."
14827,power,"they were compelled to tell of the lord’s power in their lives, and of the injustices they had suffered at the hands of the iranian regime."
14828,sentence,"they were tireless in their quest to make every story accurate, to fill every sentence with meaning and purpose."
14829,justice,"moreover, there were thoughts and experiences for which no words in any language could do justice."
14830,freedom,"we give thanks to our savior, jesus christ, who carried us safely through all our hardships, brought us to freedom in america, and gave us the chance to share with the world our stories and the stories of other iranian women."
14831,crime,"in march 2009, maryam and marziyeh were arrested in tehran for promoting christianity —a capital crime in iran—and imprisoned for 259 days in the city’s notorious evin prison."
14832,execution,"the official charges against them were apostasy, anti-government activity, and blasphemy, for which they were subject to execution by hanging."
14833,freedom,"as many around the world prayed for their freedom, international pressure on the iranian government came from organizations such as amnesty international, the united nations, and the vatican."
14834,charges,"eventually, maryam and marziyeh were released from prison and cleared of all charges."
14835,imprisoned,they consider it an honor to have experienced a little of christ’s suffering by being imprisoned in his name.

14838,where,"i hope this account can also help shed light on events unfolding in iran, where many people have gone through similar or much more difficult ordeals, but few have been free to speak of them."
14839,freed,"and after i was freed, i learned that the names of certain officials dealing with my case were likely pseudonyms."
14840,pen,"in prison, i was prohibited from having a pen and paper, but i had plenty of time to review conversations and events over and over in my mind, and after my release, i spent much of the next several weeks writing down my recollections."
14841,imprisonment,"of course, memory has its shortcomings, and not all of the dialogue from my imprisonment is repeated verbatim here."
14842,arrest,"before my arrest, i was writing a different book about iran, where i had gone to work as a journalist when i was twenty-five."
14843,where,"like my fellow female passengers on tehran’s metro, i craned my neck to catch a glimpse of these $1 to $2 items, but all i could see from where i stood jammed in the corner were the backs of heads covered in mandatory hejab."
14844,where,"i remained where i was, tired but content that with my trip to the holy city of qom behind me, i had come one step closer to finishing the interviews for the book i was writing."
14845,authorities,"everything was going more or less according to plan when, in 2006, the iranian authorities unexpectedly revoked my official press credentials."
14846,authorities,it was one of those songs available only on the black market but largely tolerated by the authorities if played in private.
14847,where,“so where are you from?” the driver yelled over the music.
14848,cell,"the japanese are very hard workers.” my cell phone rang, saving me from going into any more detail about myself."
14849,executed,"i gave him a rundown of my previous twenty-four hours, then we hung up the way we always did, with the words dust-et dâram, a term of affection meaning “i like you” or “i love you.” gradually, the car wove its way north up sadr highway, which iran’s authorities had named, like many streets and freeways, after a “martyr,” this one, a grand ayatollah who  had been executed by former iraqi president saddam hussein’s regime."
14850,state,"since iran’s 1979 islamic revolution, the islamic republic had tried to equate the idea of martyrdom, a concept highly revered in shiite islam, with self-sacrifice for the state."
14851,war,"many iranians were lured to the front lines of the iran-iraq war in the 1980s with the promise that if they died, they would become martyrs and go to heaven."
14852,where,"i got out at my neighborhood grocery store, where i picked up the ingredients for my dinner—some eggs, fresh bread, and a bag of imitation nacho doritos."
14853,building,"on my hike up five flights of stairs, i bumped into the building caretaker, gholam."
14854,illegal,"as i unlocked my door and entered my apartment, giggling children burst out of one neighbor’s unit and chased each other down the stairs, while voice of america persian boomed from another neighbor’s illegal satellite tv."
14855,building,"“i’m on the fifth floor.” “certainly.” i buzzed open the door to the building, then dragged myself back to my bedroom, put on a white headscarf, and slipped a knee-length black roopoosh over my pajamas."
14856,evin,"my modest farsi-reading skills, combined with a growing sense of unease, were hindering my comprehension of what appeared to me as: qeruzjiojitenajkfasdf azntxcjviorgtneafn 24 hours serjiojasfkjzfnty znernagyrhgbfg evin prison ewatngnmdfv."
14857,evin,evin prison?
14858,evin,“evin prison.” my heart began to pound.
14859,jail,"this tehran jail was notorious for having held iran’s most famous political prisoners, including students, academics, and activists."
14860,execution,"torture was common, and hangings and a mass execution had taken place there."

14862,death,no one had ever been held accountable for her death.
14863,evin,"“and if we are not satisfied, we can take you to evin prison tonight.” this had to be a very, very bad dream, worse than any nightmare i could remember."
14864,prisoners,"as the story went, she had been arrested after taking photos of some prisoners’ families outside evin and then responded defiantly to her interrogators."
14865,authorities,"hard-line authorities initially tried to cover up the cause of her death and later said she died from head injuries resulting from an “accident.” but according to a doctor who said he examined kazemi’s corpse and escaped iran to disclose his findings, the journalist had been raped, her nose broken, and her skull fractured."
14866,taken,another was tossing some of my notepads into an empty garbage bag he had taken from my kitchen.
14867,authorities,"i had always assumed the authorities knew about my book, which was an independent project i had openly described to the dozens of iranians i had interviewed to ensure the regime would realize i had nothing to hide."
14868,cell,then he spotted my cell phone on the kitchen counter and stuck it in his pocket.
14869,where,"the four men made me move on with them to another room, where they dug through my desk and file cabinet."
14870,evin,"i was frightened, bewildered, and furious: frightened at the prospect of landing in evin prison, bewildered by the presence of four strange men seizing my belongings, and furious at this violation of my privacy."
14871,wall,"meanwhile, javan was peeling two photos, one of bahman and the other of my family, off the wall."
14872,where,"then the men made their way to my bedroom where, speechlessly, i watched them rummage through my closet and dresser."
14873,ordered,"“change into your regular attire,” javan ordered me, after the agents declared their search complete."
14874,interrogation,“we’re taking you elsewhere for interrogation.” “why?” i asked.
14875,where,"as a journalist in iran, i felt i had discovered some purpose in my life through my work by providing news coverage from a country where few foreign journalists could live and operate."
14876,situation,"the situation had worsened after ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, replacing a reformist administration with hard-liners."
14877,law,"so i decided to keep reporting but in a limited way that didn’t require a press pass according to iranian law, as a few other  journalists in similar situations had done."
14878,authorities,the iranian authorities were aware of my continued news reporting and had never told me to stop.
14879,power,"having been raised by my parents to explore various faiths, i had created a general vision of an infinite and gracious god, a higher power to which all major religions pointed in one way or another."
14880,where,where are we going?” i ventured to ask.
14881,cell,"if you don’t, we will escort you to evin.” a cell phone rang."
14882,poverty,his nongovernmental organization was working to alleviate poverty and disease there.
14883,ordered,"“put it on speaker phone and answer it,” the agent ordered as he gave the phone to me."
14884,building,our two cars soon pulled up to a building by a park in central tehran.
14885,building,i had driven past the park before but never noticed this building.
14886,inside,"the agents took me inside, past a guard, and up a set of stairs into a windowless room."
14887,question,"as he toyed with his prayer beads, tasbihi began to question me."
14888,where,where was i born and raised?
14889,where,where did my father’s relatives live in iran?
14890,pen,"he handed me a pen, but after watching me struggle with my spelling,  he took it back and told me to dictate my replies while he wrote them."
14891,pen,he glanced at the pen in his colleague’s hand.
14892,pen,"“she can write farsi by herself!” with that, he slammed his folders on the coffee table, making both tasbihi and me jump, and thrust the pen into my hand."
14893,state,"his eyebrows appeared permanently raised, as if he were in a constant state of skepticism."
14894,power,"you know that some of them are very critical of the regime.” iran’s reformists had enjoyed the height of their formal political power under the previous president, mohammad khatami, and were now working to make a comeback, focusing on the june 2009 presidential election."
14895,national security,"“i also interviewed conservative members of parliament.” “we know you did,” javan said sharply, “including a few on the national security and foreign policy commission.” “what’s wrong with that?” i asked."
14896,question,"“they wanted to share their perspectives with foreigners through my book, and how am i supposed to accurately describe conservatives’ opinions without talking to them?” the interrogator deflected my question with another question."
14897,taken,"“who told you to interview them?” “no one,” i answered, taken aback."
14898,question,"“nobody else has a copy?” “nobody else,” i replied, uncertain why he was raising this question."
14899,state,"“i think it showed footage of the missile from iranian state-run tv,” i said."
14900,ordered,"“as you know, miss saberi,” the agent said, “washington uses such exchange programs to gather intelligence about us through the young iranians it brings to america and through the american students it sends to iran.” he ordered me to write that i met mr. a in iran and helped him with his exchange program, which was aimed at spying on the islamic republic."
14901,authorities,“you have continued to send them after your press pass was revoked in 2006.” i pointed out that i was aware the iranian authorities had known this and that the limited reporting i had been doing did not require a press pass.
14902,evin,"that will not be good for you, and we’ll have to take you to evin.” “but i’m not lying,” i said, my voice now sounding strained."
14903,evin,would they really take me to evin?
14904,charged,"in recent years, iran’s intelligence ministry had begun detaining prominent dual-national activists and academics, mostly iranian americans, but they had been primarily dealing with politically charged ideas or exchanges of intellectuals, writers, and civil-society activists."
14905,authorities,"i had always thought if the authorities had questions about my work, at most they would interrogate me."
14906,cell,"i wished that my cell phone, which was still buried in the agent’s pocket, would ring again and that it would be bahman."
14907,conviction,"“you know very well that he works for japanese intelligence,” the interrogator stated with apparent conviction."
14908,suspect,"so the japanese were suspect, too."
14909,establishment,"the goal, the hard-liners asserted, was for these elites to then use the media and civil society groups to spread antiregime ideas throughout iran’s population, which would eventually rise up against the ruling establishment."
14910,charge,"in arguing their theory, these officials liked to point to the bush administration’s “iran democracy fund,” which they alleged was aimed at changing iran’s regime—a charge washington had denied."
14911,question,"i would be faced with this seeming indifference many more times over the next few hours, as javan would read out a question, and i would reply."
14912,question,he would then order me to write my answer before he followed with another question.
14913,war,"“i interviewed a wide variety of people: artists, women taxi drivers, veterans from the iran-iraq war—” “it’s not possible you could be conducting so many interviews only for a book,” the agent interrupted, taking another sip and setting down his cup."
14914,interrogation,"the idea was ludicrous, but i should have known my interrogation would lead to this."
14915,power,"but while the iranian regime had legitimate security concerns, hard-liners frequently exploited these concerns by blaming domestic problems on foreign “hidden hands” and by using their cries of “espionage” to justify tightening their grip on power."
14916,charges,much of iranian society had learned to see such charges as bogus and politically motivated.
14917,authorities,i recalled with some irony the words of a foreign journalist once based in iran: the iranian authorities think we are all spies because they themselves use their journalists as spies.
14918,cell,"just then, my cell phone rang."
14919,freed,"remember, if you cooperate, you’ll be freed by this evening.” i didn’t know what to say."
14920,question,“people get training to pass them.” “but i didn’t get any training.” javan looked at me scornfully and went on to his next question.
14921,jail,"in this country, people like him needed no more than their own words to send someone to jail for years."
14922,evin,"“we didn’t want to take you to evin,” javan said nonchalantly, “but we gave you a chance, and you didn’t cooperate."
14923,state,"as javan headed for the door, images i had once seen on iran’s state-run tv flashed before me."
14924,detained,"in 2007, one program highlighted what its producers claimed were the confessions of three detained dual-national scholars—haleh esfandiari, kian tajbakhsh, and ramin jahanbegloo."
14925,charge,"a few months before that, iran had broadcast video clips of captured british sailors and marines “confessing” to illegally entering iranian waters—a charge london disputed."
14926,freedom,"these videos were soon followed by the captives’ release, as if confessing on tape had been a prerequisite for their freedom."
14927,prisoners,"yet forced public confessions, in which prisoners often expressed regret for their actions, denounced colleagues, and asked for forgiveness, were an institutionalized feature of iran’s intelligence apparatus."
14928,crime,"“so now you’re going to torture me until i confess on video to a crime i didn’t commit,” i snarled at javan."
14929,where,"i staggered out of the room and down the stairs, where his three colleagues were waiting for us."
14930,evin,"the driver kept going, straight to evin prison."
14931,evin,"chapter three  i had been to, or rather, outside evin, once before."
14932,gate,"now, as our car pulled up to the prison gate, i could no longer deny the reality of what was happening to me."
14933,guilty,“a person is supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
14934,guilty,"if i am guilty, you are the ones who have to prove it.” the man shrugged and turned his head away."
14935,gate,a guard waved us through the blue metal gate.
14936,building,"we drove up a winding road and parked in front of a brick building, where i was told to get out of the car."
14937,ordered,tasbihi gave me a dirty white blindfold and ordered me to cover my eyes.
14938,building,"i followed him into the building, groping the walls as i stumbled down a hallway and up a flight of stairs."
14939,prisoners,"i trembled, thinking of how many thousands of prisoners had been detained, tortured, and executed in this prison since it was built by mohammad reza shah in the 1970s and expanded after the islamic revolution."
14940,wall,"at the top of the stairs, tasbihi told me to face a wall."
14941,inside,a frosty hand seized my wrist and pulled me inside a corridor.
14942,guard,she must have been a guard.
14943,cell,"i entered a small cell with lime green walls and a thin, worn-out brown carpet."
14944,wall,"when i was completely naked, the guard told me to face the wall and open my ponytail."
14945,guard,"the guard took my tote bag, made a list of the belongings it contained, and had me sign a form and fingerprint it."
14946,where,"from there, i walked clumsily beside her a few steps down another hallway and into a room on our left, where she told me to unfasten my blindfold."
14947,case,"there was that time years ago when a counselor told me i had a mild case of depression… “well, i get depressed once in a while,” i replied."
14948,guard,"“and athletes shouldn’t get depressed,” interjected the guard, who was standing next to me."
14949,cell,"“you don’t need it.” with that, he turned to the guard and told her to take me back to my cell."
14950,guard,the guard had left four frayed military blankets in one corner for me.
14951,cell,"the cell, which measured about seven by nine feet, was clearly made to hold only one person."
14952,wall,"nailed to one wall was a sign with some instructions in farsi, which i ignored."
14953,wall,against another wall stood a rusty iron sink.
14954,guard,the guard had warned me not to drink the water.
14955,toilet,she had also told me the old toilet beside the sink no longer worked.
14956,cell,"this would activate a green light outside my cell, signaling that i needed to be let out."
14957,wall,attached to the opposite wall was a heater with a white metal cover.
14958,detainees,it was engraved with various comments left by previous detainees.
14959,freedom,"“national solidarity for the freedom of iran,” stated one in farsi."
14960,authorities,this date on the iranian calendar marked the eighth anniversary of the 1999 peaceful student protests that had rocked various iranian cities before the authorities violently suppressed them.
14961,sentence,"after his photo appeared on the cover of the economist magazine, holding up a shirt splattered with the blood of a fellow protestor, he was given a death sentence, which was later reduced to several years’ imprisonment in evin."
14962,escaped,"in 2008, when he was briefly allowed out of prison for medical treatment, he escaped to neighboring iraq and was later granted political asylum in america."
14963,jailed,"toward the top of the heater, someone had drawn several parallel lines, apparently indicating the number of days she had been jailed."
14964,guard,"“god…save…” i etched into the heater, “iran.” i had to keep myself from adding, “from these awful people.” the guard might later inspect what i had written."
14965,wall,"as i was finishing my artwork, i heard a whimpering sound coming from the other side of  the wall through the perforations in my heater."
14966,cell,then i heard a neighboring cell door open.
14967,guard,"“you must eat something,” i heard the guard say."
14968,guard,"“ok, it’s up to you,” the guard replied."
14969,guard,"“is she still refusing to eat?” asked someone, who must have been another guard."
14970,cell,"the air was thick with dust, and my cell smelled like a junkyard of metal and cement, devoid of life and activity."
14971,where,where are you?
14972,guard,"the guard from the night before opened my door to hand me a plastic cup of tea, along with some white bread and a sliver of cheese."
14973,wall,"i didn’t touch the food and sat against the wall, speculating about what new horrors this day might bring."
14974,cell,"this was followed by the sound of footsteps scuttling past my cell, pausing, and scuttling back, until they stopped outside my door."
14975,guard,"this time when the door opened, i saw a slim woman guard in her midtwenties."
14976,ward,"i was led out of the women’s ward, down the hallway, and through an open door padded with leather, where i entered a room and was told to sit down."
14977,wall,"when i tipped back my head, i spotted a plastic school desk with a writing arm, facing a foam-covered wall."
14978,guard,"how are you?” it was the cold, measured voice of javan, the young interrogator the guard must have been referring to as my bâzju."
14979,court,"“but if you don’t, we will have to take you to court, where tafhim-e ettehâm mishi.” i had never heard this phrase before."
14980,charge,"“it means you will be told the charge against you.” i heard the screech of a chair behind me, followed by the clicking of heels approaching and what sounded like a heap of papers being thrown on my desk."
14981,where,then the shoes clicked back to where they had originated.
14982,pen,i obeyed and saw a pen and a pile of blank forms before me.
14983,authorities,"based on this practice, iranian authorities claimed that their treatment of dual nationals like me was an internal matter."
14984,law,"“so even if you were born and raised in america,” my bâzju continued, “you are an iranian according to our law."
14985,ordered,"i did as he ordered, and the interrogation began anew."
14986,question,"similar to the day before, my interrogator would pose a question, i would verbally answer it, and then i would write down my reply, all in farsi."
14987,question,"once in a while, another interrogator would jump in with a comment or question."
14988,prisons,"accounts of sexual assault in iran’s prisons were not uncommon, and i didn’t know if these men would touch me, or worse."
14989,crime,“they tell us everything.” i was at a loss to understand why javan considered the interview a crime.
14990,illegal,"“if you’re saying it was illegal to ask these questions,” i reasoned, “then should the u.s. government also detain me for having interviewed iraqi kurdish officials about their ties to washington?” “we know you went to iraqi kurdistan,” another interrogator cut in."
14991,where,he was referring to the region in northern iraq where ethnic kurds lived.
14992,state,"they were considered the world’s largest ethnic group without its own state, although the kurdistan regional government in northern iraq had recently won formal autonomy."
14993,state,"some kurds had called for more autonomy, or even separation from iran in order to form a “greater kurdistan” state with their counterparts in nearby syria, turkey, and iraq."
14994,jailed,we had both thought the filming might have to do with our mutual acquaintance who was jailed at the time.
14995,crime,"was my crime visiting foreign embassies in tehran, conducting interviews the authorities didn’t like, or writing a book they could not censor?"
14996,term,"i had a phone call, he informed me, from the interrogators’ boss at the intelligence ministry, a man he referred to as haj agha, a term often used to show respect to men."
14997,evin,"“miss saberi,” came a voice, gruff despite its singsong accent particular to central iran, “if you cooperate today, by tomorrow evening, you will be continuing this conversation with my colleagues in the comfort of the esteghlal hotel, not in evin prison.” the esteghlal hotel was just down the hill from the prison."
14998,evin,"still, i would have preferred the esteghlal to evin any day."
14999,interrogation,"i am telling the truth.” he hung up, and i was taken back to the interrogation room, where my captors continued to question me."
15000,jailed,"why did an american acquaintance of mine want to sell vitamins in iran, why had i gone out for coffee with an american journalist in tehran, and why had i tried to help my jailed iranian acquaintance a few months earlier?"
15001,guilty,"yet every time i responded to their questions, they twisted my replies to sound as though i were guilty of undercover intelligence work."
15002,ordered,"they ordered me to write down their responses, which i stubbornly tried to twist back into mine."
15003,question,"sometimes the men shot out one question after another so quickly, i hardly had time to reflect on my answers."
15004,case,"this was most conspicuously the case with my book, which appeared to be their main object of interest."
15005,inside,"“the interviews inside iran that you’ve asked me about were really for my book,” i maintained, “and those i did outside iran were really for either news reports or my book.” “it’s not possible you could be doing so many interviews just for a book.” “i have a habit of doing a lot of research to comprehend a subject well,” i explained."
15006,court,"unfortunately, now we’ll have to take you to court to see the prosecuting magistrate.”  this time when i was loaded into a car, a male guard handcuffed me."
15007,guard,"i recognized neither the driver nor the guard who sat beside him, holding on his lap a bulky, black pouch—just large enough to carry a handgun."
15008,suspect,"they and bahman might start to suspect i was in trouble, but not trouble like this."
15009,arrest,"if news of my arrest were to reach my father, i dreaded to think what effect it might have on him."
15010,evin,i had to get out of evin as soon as possible.
15011,building,"i had been to this area several times before, but never to the building we were now approaching."
15012,court,"“the revolutionary court of tehran,” he replied."
15013,court,iran’s revolutionary court system ran parallel to the country’s other courts.
15014,crimes,it tried cases such as crimes against national security and slandering the supreme leader or islam.
15015,prisoners,"women’s rights activists, students, unionists, journalists, bloggers, academics, politicians, and many others had been summoned here on political charges, although the regime liked to refer to them as “security” prisoners, not “political” ones."
15016,state,"the state’s security-oriented approach toward society, which had somewhat relaxed under khatami, had become more prevalent under president ahmadinejad, who had installed hard-liners as the heads of various ministries, including the intelligence ministry and the ministry of culture and islamic guidance."
15017,authorities,"the authorities had rolled back social freedoms, increased suppression of the student movement, and hindered political, ethnic, and social activism."
15018,sentences,local journalists and bloggers continued to be interrogated or given prison sentences.
15019,building,the guard removed my handcuffs and led me to the second floor of the building.
15020,guard,the guard took me to the one on the far left.
15021,confinement,"“start him off with one week in solitary confinement and one phone call,” the magistrate said."
15022,where,"“where are you from?” the magistrate asked me casually, as if simply making small talk."
15023,charged,"“i’ve been living in iran for the past six years.” “you are being charged with acting against national security,” he said in the same easygoing manner."
15024,charge,"i knew that this was a common charge, one so vague it allowed iranian authorities to punish people for a variety of  peaceful activities."
15025,arrest,"for the first time since my arrest, i could feel my stomach growling."
15026,detention,"then the magistrate gave me a pen and a piece of paper and said, “write down your defense.” with a tremulous hand, i wrote something like: i protest my detention and object to the charge against me."
15027,guard,"the magistrate picked up the sheet, reminded me i would be treated as an iranian citizen despite my american nationality, and told the guard who had brought me to take me away."
15028,law,"i wished i had studied some iranian law, although i had a feeling that no matter what the law was, my captors could interpret it as they wished or even act above it."
15029,interrogation,"“may i get a lawyer?” “when your interrogation is complete,” the magistrate replied."
15030,lawyer,i needed a lawyer now.
15031,interrogation,“how long will my interrogation take?” i ventured.
15032,confinement,"“how long do i have to stay in solitary confinement?” i asked, wondering whether the magistrate’s ruling for the other detainee would be the same for me."
15033,guard,“it depends on your interrogators.” my guard was gesturing at me to get up.
15034,pleaded,“but could i at least make a phone call?” i pleaded.
15035,where,"then, looking at the guard, he said, “she can make one phone call today from prison.” as we were leaving, i glanced over my shoulder to read the sign outside the antechamber where we had just been."
15036,guard,"the guard loaded me into the car again, and the handcuffs came back on."
15037,evin,"as we headed toward evin, i gazed damp-eyed through the window."
15038,freed,but this trip to the magistrate had wiped out what little hope i still had that i might be freed soon.
15039,fugitive,"then i would leap into a dumpster, like a fugitive in the movies, mixing with the rats while the two agents ran by me unaware."
15040,interrogation,"it must have been late afternoon when i was returned to the interrogation room, my eyes wrapped once again, and i informed my captors that the magistrate had said i was allowed  to make a phone call."
15041,where,"“where did you get them?” i explained that i had received many such articles at the center for strategic research, where i had attended conferences and, at the request of a friend, corrected the english grammar of a few articles."
15042,where,"“it’s public information.” “it’s secret.” “if it’s really secret, where’s the stamp on it?” i had heard that secret documents in iran were marked with a stamp."
15043,institution,"“as i told you, the  book i have been writing is a personal project and not for any institution or government.” “and as i told you, i am allergic to the word book,” javan retorted."
15044,pleaded,"“just give me a polygraph test,” i pleaded, as i had the day before, “and you will see that i am telling the truth!” “fix your hejab!” another interrogator thundered at me."
15045,sentenced,"“miss saberi,” came my bâzju’s voice, dark and intense, “if you don’t cooperate, we will have you sentenced to ten years in prison."
15046,sink,that could be extended for another ten years.” he paused to let the words sink in.
15047,imprison,"“i thought if you had questions, you might interrogate and release me, not imprison me.” “well,” he said, with a snide chuckle, “we wanted to wait and see if you changed your ways on your own."
15048,national security,"if i really was such a threat to national security, it didn’t make sense that my captors would wait to detain me until just before my departure."
15049,arrested,"they could have easily arrested me months or years earlier at the tehran airport when i was making one of my frequent trips, as they sometimes did to academics and activists entering or leaving the country."
15050,crime,"then javan spoke, his voice lower now: “miss saberi, your crime is very serious."
15051,penalty,"espionage can also result in the death penalty.” my heart thudded in my gut, and my mouth became dry."
15052,trial,human-rights groups claimed that many executions took place after a kangaroo trial or no trial at all.
15053,prisoners,"group hangings often made headlines, with many victims accused of drug trafficking and armed robbery, although human-rights activists believed some were political prisoners."
15054,prisoners,"juveniles were sometimes executed, as were some prisoners found guilty of security-related crimes, including an iranian telecommunications salesman convicted of espionage who was hanged in 2008."
15055,evin,"the hangings, some of which had taken place in evin, were often conducted secretly."
15056,executed,"if i were executed, maybe no one would ever find out."
15057,hanged,"the local papers might refer to me simply as “r.s.,” who, along with a bunch of other initials, “was hanged at five a.m. on friday.” “could i please call bahman now?” i asked timidly."
15058,arrest,"“what do you want to tell him?”  “i want to tell him where i am,” i replied, inwardly hoping that bahman could raise a fuss over my arrest in the media and among his many fans and kurdish contacts."
15059,freed,"“if you cooperate, you will be freed by tomorrow or at the latest, the day after."
15060,where,"but if you tell him where you are, this won’t be possible anymore.” “but,” i said in a thin voice, “i don’t understand."
15061,where,"“they come from all walks of life: students, athletes, artists, journalists like you…” ever since i had moved to iran, several of my iranian friends had warned me to be careful about what i said, where, and to whom."
15062,where,"“they just help us gather a little information about who is doing what, saying what, going where, with whom…."
15063,detainees,"other detainees have agreed to work with us, too, in exchange for their freedom.” i felt so helpless, so powerless."
15064,freed,"“ok, but remember, if you tell him where you are, you won’t be freed any time soon."
15065,cell,"“just explain to him you made a last-minute trip to do some research on your book, you forgot your cell-phone charger, and you’re in the countryside, where there are no telephones,” he said, the lies rolling off his tongue."
15066,cell,"so tell him you’ll be back from zahedan by the day after tomorrow.” “um…” i knew if i didn’t agree, javan wouldn’t let me call, “ok.” tasbihi’s black shoes reemerged beside me to lead me down the hallway, where my cell phone could get a signal."
15067,cell,"then he told me to lift my blindfold, which i had been ordered to lower when i got up to leave the interrogation room, and handed me my cell phone."
15068,where,“where on earth have you been?” he cried.
15069,where,“where are you?” he asked.
15070,cell,now his cell phone was turned off.
15071,cell,bahman’s cell phone was still turned off.
15072,where,"it was in what was said to be the most lawless and unsafe province of iran, where sunni muslim militants and armed bandits had reportedly kidnapped and assassinated civilians and officials."
15073,suspect,"once bahman learned of my disappearance, he would suspect rebels or bandits, not the regime, which would likely pretend it knew nothing of my whereabouts, even if my captors killed me and threw my body in a ditch."
15074,torture,only a victim of torture could sound like that.
15075,state,i feared i might soon be reduced to the same state.
15076,interrogation,"back in my interrogation room, i crumpled into my chair, my eyes covered and my ears alert, as i waited for the unknown."
15077,court,and we will make sure the magistrate you saw today at court sets you free.” i couldn’t speak.
15078,prisoners,i had heard that physical threats against prisoners’ family members was one torture technique used in the islamic republic.
15079,state,"the iranian state must have had more pressing priorities than chasing down a couple in their sixties in north dakota—but my captors didn’t seem to care whether i lived or died, so why would they be any more sympathetic to the rest of the saberi family?"
15080,crime,"the interrogators continued to warn of what would happen to my family and me if i didn’t “repent of my crime,” earn their trust, and consent to spy for them."
15081,freedom,"and if all those other people had to confess to win their freedom, who was i to resist the warped way things worked here?"
15082,confinement,"in the islamic republic, i was an iranian citizen who could be locked up in solitary confinement, cut off from the world, wrongly convicted, and then executed."
15083,power,"in this prison, these hard-line fanatics held all the power, and according to their worldview, i couldn’t possibly be innocent."
15084,guilty,"i couldn’t believe what i was contemplating—i, who had felt guilty on the rare occasions i had told friends a white lie just to make them feel better."
15085,crime,my only way out was to admit to a crime i did not commit and to ask for forgiveness.
15086,freed,"i could always, like many before me, recant my lies once i was freed."
15087,where,"what information did you give him—when, where, and how?” my head spun as i began to realize how many hideous lies i would now be forced to tell."
15088,locked,"i had to memorize these questions because i would have to think up a story based on them the next day—if i didn’t want to be tortured, locked up for years, or killed."
15089,cell,i was taken back to my cell by a woman guard.
15090,cell,"“trust in god,” she added, as she raised her eyes toward the ceiling and slammed the heavy cell door shut behind her."
15091,death,"two nights ago i claimed i no longer needed to live, and now i am prepared to take almost any measure to avoid death."
15092,evin,it is impossible to be gandhi in evin prison.
15093,where,"chapter six  let’s pick up where we left off last night,” javan said to me the next morning."
15094,interrogation,we were the only people in the interrogation room.
15095,allegedly,"wasn’t $15,000 a pretty good amount for allegedly giving someone copies of a few interviews?"
15096,where,"“where is it, and how much is left?” the agent asked."
15097,freed,"“remember, if you want to be freed any time soon, you must cooperate."
15098,war,“and another article… about the u.s. war in iraq?” “how did you get it?” he asked.
15099,state,"“i copied it.” “you copied it?” “yes.” the interrogator arched one eyebrow, lifting it higher than its normal state, and nodded slowly."
15100,kidnapper,"if javan had told me to say i was a kidnapper or a drug trafficker, i would have said yes, if that’s what it took for him to think i was “cooperating” so he wouldn’t hurt me and would set me free."
15101,warrant,"you can be certain i will personally sign your death warrant.” every muscle in my body went taut, and my heart started to gallop."
15102,freedom,"i could only hope they would gain me the freedom i needed to take them back, before my captors could use them to try to blackmail me to do their bidding."
15103,cell,"the sign on my cell wall, the one i had ignored two nights before, quoted ayatollah khomeini: prisons must be colleges for human improvement."
15104,detainees,some regulations about how writing on the walls was absolutely prohibited and how often detainees could take showers and use the toilet.
15105,cell,"whimpering arose from the cell behind mine, just as i had heard on my first night in evin."
15106,power,"some believed this practice stemmed from centuries of foreign invasions and various authoritarian regimes, which taught iranians to mask their true thoughts and feelings, particularly from people in power."
15107,where,"of course, i had met iranians who believed that honesty was the best policy, but many others felt the “expedient lie” was justified in a country where what you did or thought in private was often considered illegal or unacceptable by the regime."
15108,freed,i vowed to myself that i would find him as soon as i was freed.
15109,wall,"chapter seven  may i say something?” i asked javan, after i settled back into my desk in the interrogation room on tuesday morning, blindfolded and facing the wall once again."
15110,sentence,"“the sign in my cell quotes imam khomeini saying, ‘prisons must be colleges for—’” “‘—human improvement,’” he finished the sentence for me."
15111,freed,"“and remember, if you want to get out of here any time soon, you will cooperate.” “but you told me before that i would be freed by today at the latest,” i protested."
15112,freed,“i said you might be freed by today.” is that what he had said?
15113,freed,“so when do you think i’ll be freed?” i asked.
15114,where,"“we just need to take care of a few odds and ends, and then you can go.” “people will start to wonder where i am.” “no one will notice you’re gone,” he countered."
15115,cell,"my interrogators must have collected most of the names from my e-mails, phone calls, and the list of contacts in my cell phone."
15116,prisoners,"it was common knowledge that iran’s intelligence apparatus was obsessed with gathering even the most trivial information on virtually anyone, in many cases for no apparent reason, and that this was a routine part of the interrogation process for many prisoners."
15117,power,"i wished i knew of some way to get out of this, but i felt i had absolutely no bargaining power."
15118,where,"the interrogators demanded to know how i knew so-and-so, where we had met, and what that person’s job was."
15119,where,"i wasn’t sure how they had obtained some of the other details they brought up, such as my having gone to miss r’s birthday party, where turkey sandwiches were served."
15120,state,“we just want you to state them.
15121,pen,my knuckles went white around my pen.
15122,crime,"“she won’t admit to her crime.” “oh,” i said."
15123,charge,"i hoped she would figure out that her path to freedom lay not in futile tears but in confessing to the charge against her, whether or not it was true."
15124,pen,i turned to a new page to see two words that i had been praying would be spared my pen: bahman ghobadi.
15125,authorities,"i had never heard of him, but by surfing the web before leaving for his apartment, i learned he was a director who had made the world’s first kurdish-language feature-length movie in 2000, and although his films had won many top international awards, the iranian authorities had rarely allowed them to be screened in the country’s theaters."
15126,war,"bahman said many independent filmmakers like him were treated by the regime as “outsiders,” as opposed to “insiders” who worked with the authorities and often made movies in admiration of islam, the revolution, and the iran-iraq war."
15127,poverty,"he was generous and compassionate, doing all he could for his six younger siblings and their families, and he supported many poverty-stricken kurdish children, including some who had starred in his movies."
15128,question,"“what was the question?” “i said, ‘tell—me—how—you—two—met,’” he spat, each word like the jab of a dagger."
15129,taken,"but like many couples in iran, we had never taken the precaution of getting a sigheh, or temporary marriage, which would have made our relationship permissible in the islamic republic."
15130,ordered,"“write down your answers,” he ordered me."
15131,pen,"a tear splattered my paper, smudging my pen’s blue ink."
15132,sentence,"my captors wouldn’t appreciate this sentence, but i didn’t care."
15133,cell,could they have monitored my  conversations and interviews through my cell phone even when i had turned it off as a precaution?
15134,detainees,did they do this to all detainees?
15135,sentences,i wrote my answers in large print and repeated the same sentences in different ways.
15136,ordered,"“study these topics tonight, and think about how you will answer them on camera tomorrow,” he ordered me."
15137,prisoners,"getting videotaped was inevitable if i was to be freed, just like many of the political prisoners before me who had endured similar ordeals."
15138,ward,one of the agents led me back to the women’s ward.
15139,state,"while i had tried my best to state only innocuous information that day, in a few cases, i had succumbed to my captors’ threats and told them what they wanted to hear."
15140,death,i could have—should have—refused to speak even a single word—even if it led to my death.
15141,cell,a guard left me in my cell with a heavy plastic bag.
15142,inside,"i looked inside it to see bananas, oranges, and small cartons of juice."
15143,guilt,guilt and shame consumed me as tears started to stream down my face.
15144,wall,"as far as i could tell facing the wall, he was the only person in the interrogation room with me."
15145,arrest,"“but he won’t bring any change in u.s. policies toward iran.” barack obama, who had taken office on january 20, just eleven days before my arrest, had pledged to step up u.s. diplomatic efforts with iran, although he had also said washington should not take any options, including military action, off the table."
15146,detainees,"even if this video aired before i could publicly recant, i hoped that people familiar with the methods of the islamic republic and other police states would know it was staged, as were the videotaped confessions of many other detainees."
15147,where,"my bâzju led me into another room down the hallway, where he told me to untie my blindfold and sit behind a white formica table."
15148,prisoners,"a woman guard had ordered me to put them on that morning, just as other prisoners i had seen on iranian tv were dressed in their personal attire."
15149,hole,jutting out of a hole in the cloth was a camera lens.
15150,sentences,javan stopped the camera many times and commanded me to rephrase sentences or to devise completely new ones that were more to his liking.
15151,authorities,"at one point, he told me to talk about the israeli government, and i deliberately referred to it using the phrase “zionist regime,” as iranian authorities officially called it."
15152,term,i hoped potential viewers would realize i would not normally use this term and would conclude that i had been speaking under duress.
15153,ward,"instead, i said courteously, “thank you.” “thursday and friday, as you know, are the weekend,” he explained, as he walked me, with my eyes covered again, back to the women’s ward."
15154,confinement,i suggest you use this time in solitary confinement to think about all the awful things you have done.”  my interrogator was right: i had done “awful things”—but not the ones he claimed.
15155,cell,i bowed my forehead to the floor of my cell.
15156,where,"i could become a schoolteacher in fargo, where i would take care of my parents as they grew old."
15157,where,"he made his way to japan, where he volunteered as an english teacher."
15158,locked,"when my parents found out, they locked me in our home for weeks."
15159,where,"soon afterward, i secretly left japan and flew to tehran, where we got married in 1971."
15160,cell,"your brother was four then, and you were two.” good ol’ safe fargo, i said to myself, as i heard the door to my cell open."
15161,sink,"fargo was home to only a few iranian families when i was a child, i recalled as i poured the tea down the sink and began pacing again."
15162,state,"the next year, i toured the state as miss north dakota, speaking about “cultural appreciation.” in addition to getting over my stage fright, i earned enough scholarship money to get a master’s degree in journalism."
15163,war,"moreover, the united states was preparing for a possible war against saddam hussein, and there was speculation that iran might be washington’s next target."
15164,cell,"“khâk bar saram,” i cursed myself in farsi, “dirt on my head.” maybe if i hadn’t loved iran so much and tried to write a book to help others understand it, i wouldn’t be locked up in this miserable cell."
15165,arrest,why hadn’t i paid closer attention to the signs that could have warned me of my arrest?
15166,basij,"although he was no longer an active member of the basij, as a teenager hassan had joined the volunteer paramilitary force, which was founded in november 1979 by decree of ayatollah khomeini."
15167,war,"it was thrown into its first great test when iraqi troops under saddam hussein invaded iran in 1980, sending the neighboring nations into a devastating eight-year war."
15168,where,"he became very nosy, always wanting to know where i was going, when, and with whom."
15169,authorities,"maybe the intelligence ministry had sent him to monitor me, and once i had told him good-bye, the authorities didn’t replace him with anyone."
15170,jailed,"in any case, i should have realized i might end up here, after witnessing the growing number of other dual nationals, writers, and journalists jailed before me."
15171,justice,i had also been foolish to expect justice and rationality from iran’s hard-liners.
15172,basij,"the ministry, along with the law enforcement forces, the basij, and the revolutionary guards, shared the main responsibility for iran’s internal security."
15173,power,"it was heir to the prerevolutionary secret police force, savak, the most feared institution of the shah, which had persecuted many of the people who came to power after the revolution."
15174,basij,"to perform this role, the ministry commonly installed agents, many with a background in the basij or the revolutionary guards, in places such as universities, embassies, and offices,  both in iran and abroad."
15175,imprisonment,"the ministry became notorious for intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and periodic executions and assassinations, and it was rarely answerable to others."
15176,chain,"in 1999, however, it conceded that some of its own staff were responsible for a mysterious chain of murders of iranian political activists and intellectuals, although it blamed a rogue operation."
15177,state,"by the end of khatami’s presidency in 2005, the ministry was somewhat cleansed of radical hard-liners, although many of them were thought to have continued their work in parallel state intelligence units elsewhere, for example, in the judiciary."
15178,alleged,"mohseni-ezhei alleged that numerous ordinary iranians, as well as some moderate exofficials, were acting as infiltrators and the enemy’s fifth column."
15179,insane,i must be going insane.
15180,confinement,i was trapped in solitary confinement in evin prison.
15181,pen,"and i had no pen, no paper, no human contact—except for the guards."
15182,cell,"they opened my cell door every few hours to deliver tea or a plate of food, which i hardly touched."
15183,cell,"though i had sometimes spent two or three days writing in my apartment without going outside, now the realization that i could not set foot beyond my cell door whenever i wished made me want to claw my way up the walls."
15184,cell,i would rather have been marooned on an island like the one in the american tv series lost than stuck in this tiny cell alone.
15185,cell,the guards had one in their quarters around the corner from my cell.
15186,prisoner,so did the intermittent whimpering of the prisoner next door.
15187,wall,"i whispered through the holes in the heater on my wall that she shouldn’t worry, everything would turn out all right."
15188,detainee,i wondered if both sounds emanated from the same person and whether she was a detainee.
15189,imprison,"how could these people imprison an old, ill woman?"
15190,question,"maybe the more appropriate question was, how could anyone laugh in such a god-awful place?"
15191,cell,"after two days, on friday afternoon, my cell door opened to reveal a rotund middle-aged guard."
15192,evin,she was the first person in evin to express any warmth toward me.
15193,freedom,"literally, it meant “eating the air.” was this another way of saying “freedom”?"
15194,wall,"“get dressed, and i’ll take you outside.” i did as she said, and she led me down the corridor to the left, past a telephone on the wall, and through a door into a bare, walled-in, concrete yard."
15195,where,it took several seconds for my eyes to adjust to the bright sunlight and for me to realize this must have been the place where i had unsuccessfully tried to call bahman five days earlier.
15196,freedom,"it wasn’t freedom, but it was a twenty-minute opportunity to stretch my legs and walk around in a square—over and over and over again."
15197,detainees,javan had boasted that the prison staff ate the same food as the detainees.
15198,prisoners,i guessed our captors didn’t want to give prisoners one more thing to complain about once they were released.
15199,arrest,it was the first time since my arrest that i consumed more than a few bites.
15200,freed,"not that i had much of an appetite, but i needed to build my strength to escape from the clutches of the intelligence ministry after i was freed the next day."
15201,cell,chapter nine  a clattering sound was coming from outside my cell.
15202,guard,"the shutter over the small, barred window in the door squeaked open, exposing the pretty eyes of the slim, young guard from my first morning in prison."
15203,confinement,i stood up to look out the window in my door for the first time since i was thrown in solitary confinement one week earlier.
15204,cell,on the wall facing my cell hung a poster showing ayatollah khomeini’s stern face floating amid feathery white clouds.
15205,prisoners,"below this celestial display was written something to the effect of, “anyone who imagines that religion is separate from politics is ignorant.” i wondered whether this poster was meant for the guards or for restive prisoners like me with nothing else to look at."
15206,law,"after the islamic revolution, shiite islam was made the country’s official religion, and islam was decreed the law of the land."
15207,power,"* an islamic government was created whose focal point of power was based on ayatollah khomeini’s idea of the velâyat-e faqih, or rule of the islamic jurist."
15208,sharia,"this was supposed to be the jurist best qualified to interpret god’s will and sharia, or islamic law."
15209,authority,some wanted to limit the authority of the supreme leader or questioned khamenei’s leadership.
15210,imprisonment,"the price for expressing such ideas could be high—defrocking, imprisonment, even execution."
15211,court,"clerics were prosecuted by the regime’s special clerical court, which was once headed by the current intelligence minister, mohseni-ezhei."
15212,cell,"perhaps some outspoken critics of the regime had at one time sat in this cell, looking upon this poster with contempt or disinterest."
15213,cell,"i was so despondent, i would have rather talked to my nasty bâzju than sit in my cell alone."
15214,interrogation,skinny reappeared to take me to the interrogation room.
15215,wall,"“haj agha watched your video,” javan told me after i sat down with my eyes bound, facing the wall."
15216,ordered,"“summarize your notes,” he ordered me."
15217,interrogation,"“try to smile once in a while, and use hand gestures,” javan instructed me, back in the interrogation room the next day."
15218,freed,"“well,” i explained, avoiding his eyes, “you told me i would be released yesterday, but i keep having to do these videos.” “miss saberi,” he said, plainly annoyed, “if you get this right, you’ll be freed very soon."
15219,war,say that you gave him the document that you copied—the one about the u.s. war in iraq.” “but—” “miss saberi”—he hurled the words at me—“do you want to waste away here?
15220,cell,he was about to send me back to my cell when i asked if i could call my father to at least let him know i was alive.
15221,pen,javan clicked a pen in his hand repeatedly as he considered my request.
15222,freed,"“you might not need to because you’ll soon be freed.” tomorrow, he informed me before passing me off to a woman guard, i was to create a composite computer picture of mr. d, using a special software program."
15223,interrogation,"it was monday, and i had been taken to a different interrogation room, where i had been told to remove my blindfold."
15224,guard,"the evening before, the smiling, rotund guard, whom i had heard the other guards calling  haj khanom, had led me blindfolded and quaking to the prison basement."
15225,torture,"what if this was a torture room, buried in the basement where no one could hear my cries for help?"
15226,cell,"i had only longed for haj khanom, who soon took me back to the refuge of my cell."
15227,question,"“yes,” he replied, noticeably surprised by my question."
15228,ward,"something is really going to happen this saturday, i thought, getting my hopes up again, as my interrogator delivered me to the women’s ward without dropping any hints about my future."
15229,cell,"chapter ten  i figured i would be left alone in my cell all day that tuesday, february 10, the final day of the ten days of dawn."
15230,police,"on this date thirty years ago, crowds roused by revolutionary zeal stormed the police and army buildings, and the shah’s last forces surrendered."
15231,taken,"since then, the two countries had taken occasional steps toward rapprochement, but for the most part, tensions and mistrust had remained high."
15232,power,"it had also resisted many internal power struggles and challenges, often ruthlessly crushing any opposition."
15233,power,"in the eyes of many iranian officials, the preservation of the regime—and, as an extension, their own positions in power—justified using almost any means."
15234,state,"yet although the regime had maintained its power base, divisions among the country’s leaders still existed, and the divide between the state and large parts of iranian society had widened."
15235,freedom,"she had told me her family attended every year “to show we are united behind the islamic revolution and its principles: independence, freedom, and the islamic republic.” tens of thousands of iranians were already milling about freedom square when we arrived."
15236,death,"some were holding effigies of president bush, and others were carrying signs saying “death to america!” fatemeh believed this slogan was aimed not at the american people but at the american government."
15237,war,"washington had supported the shah, she said, was behind the 1953 coup that overthrew prime minister mohammad mossadegh, and backed saddam hussein in the iran-iraq war."
15238,death,"as we were leaving, we passed a young man shouting, “death to australia!"
15239,death,"death to iceland!” his friend added, “death to all the countries in the world!” they were both laughing boisterously."
15240,case,"death to am’rika!” their ditty reminded me that many iranians ridiculed tehran’s suspicions of washington by blaming america, tongue in cheek, for whatever went wrong  in their lives, whether a car accident, a delayed bus or, as in this case, a lack of everyday products."
15241,death,"i wondered whether president obama’s recent election would make the “death to america” chants less prevalent, or at least less strident, than in previous years."
15242,confinement,"speculation, i realized, served no use, except to pass my time in solitary confinement."
15243,cell,i stared at my cell walls and let my mind run wild until sleep came.
15244,freed,"it was late wednesday morning, and still, i had no news from my interrogator about whether i would indeed be freed on saturday."
15245,cell,"sitting alone in my cell, i started to expect the worst."
15246,trial,what if my captors put me on trial claiming my false confession is true?
15247,sentences,"they say they want me to spy for them, but what if a judge sentences me to death?"
15248,wall,"i crawled toward the door, hoisted myself up, and mustered all my strength to press the black button on the wall."
15249,guard,the guard was taking longer than usual to walk down the corridor and open my door.
15250,wall,"i staggered down the corridor, entered the bathroom, and leaned my hands against the wall."
15251,cell,"i waited a minute or two, then wobbled out of the bathroom and back toward my cell, steadying myself by pressing against the corridor wall."
15252,cell,"when i made it to my cell, she stood up and shut the door behind me."
15253,arrest,perhaps reflecting upon the conversation i had with my father just days before my arrest would help.
15254,imprisoned,"my body may be imprisoned, but i can transcend this material world."
15255,ward,it was the bell outside the women’s ward.
15256,cell,"i heard footsteps again, this time scurrying toward my cell."
15257,freed,"“if you want to be freed soon, your parents must not know where you are so that you can collaborate with us in the future,” he said."
15258,detained,“tell your father you’ve been detained for buying alcohol.
15259,cell,"tell him the head of an alcohol sales network was arrested and your phone number was among those found in his cell phone, so the police came to your home and arrested you.” alcohol was illegal for muslims in the islamic republic, but it wasn’t hard to find on the black market, and some iranians even made it at home."
15260,penalty,the penalty for possession was usually at most a fine.
15261,where,"“if your father asks where you are, say you don’t know,” javan continued."
15262,freedom,why should i trust him when none of his promises of freedom has materialized?
15263,cell,"we reached the outdoor yard, where javan handed me my cell phone and told me to lift my blindfold."
15264,where,"“roxana, where have you been?"
15265,detained,"are you ok?” “i’m ok. are you ok?” “both your mother and i are fine.” “dad, i’ve been detained for having alcohol in my home,” i said, tripping over my words a little."
15266,cell,"“i was arrested because the guy who sold it to me was caught, and my phone number was in his cell phone.” i paused for a second."
15267,arrested,"“tell bahman that the man who was arrested was ‘jaffar,’ the same guy i bought alcohol from for my birthday.” please, dad, i pleaded internally, remember to repeat this to bahman."
15268,where,then he asked me where i was.
15269,cell,"“remember, dad, tell bahman the alcohol story.” i had been on the line for only a minute or two, but javan was now extending his hand to snatch my cell phone from me."
15270,cell,"we recorded everything.” he handed me off to tasbihi, who deposited me at the women’s ward with the warning, “if you lied to him, it will cost you dearly.”  back in my cell, i prayed that javan knew neither japanese nor that my grandfather was no longer living."
15271,death,i hoped i had never mentioned his death in an e-mail that my captors had monitored.
15272,detained,i tried to console myself with the thought that at least my parents now knew i was detained somewhere in tehran instead of taken hostage by bandits or rebels in zahedan.
15273,interrogation,ages passed before tasbihi came to take me to the interrogation room.
15274,wall,"there, he told me to sit down, eyes covered, facing the wall as usual."
15275,arrest,"“now i want you to call your parents back and tell them the judge has decided your arrest was a mistake,” javan said."
15276,where,"he took me back to the yard, where i called my parents again and dictated the new message to them."
15277,exercise,"that evening, i decided to exercise."
15278,death,"during my twelve days in solitary, i had been too preoccupied with the possibility of death to concern myself with my regular workout routine."
15279,cell,"i started to exercise in place, taking care not to whack the walls of my small cell with my flailing arms and legs."
15280,cell,then a guard let me out of my cell to take a shower in the bathroom down the corridor.
15281,hole,"suds from whoever had showered before me were still draining into the toilet hole in the grimy, white-tiled floor."
15282,arrest,"i watched as the water poured over my head, rinsing the grease out of my hair, and  ran down my body, much skinnier now than it was before my arrest."
15283,freedom,counting down to freedom over the next two days was nerve-racking and interminable.
15284,prisoner,"at least my interrogator had given me a newspaper to read, a gift that skinny had assured me was a sign of a prisoner’s impending release."
15285,cell,"at night, the small, yellow bulb, which was always turned on in my cell, emitted only a weak glow."
15286,cell,"when i tired of the newspaper, i imagined playing the piano by lightly rapping my fingers on the wall of my cell."
15287,wall,"but rachmaninoff was too difficult to play on the wall and definitely too complex to hum, so i decided to tap out one of my own compositions."
15288,escaped,"i tried my luck with christmas carols: “joy to the world,” “deck the halls,” and “rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,” although the names of the other eight reindeer escaped me."
15289,charged,"then there was “the star-spangled banner.” like many iranians, i hadn’t learned iran’s postrevolutionary, ideologically charged national anthem."
15290,freedom,"“the land of the free.” now that i had been deprived of freedom, i valued it more than ever."
15291,jail,freedom to interview people and to write a book about them without being thrown in jail.
15292,freedom,freedom to tell my parents my whereabouts.
15293,freedom,"freedom to use the bathroom when i wanted, to read a book, to have a pen and paper."
15294,freedom,freedom to walk without a blindfold and to shut off the lights at night.
15295,coercion,freedom from coercion to make a false confession and to spy in exchange for my release.
15296,guilty,"the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, to remain silent, to have a lawyer."
15297,due process,i tried to recall the rights of due process and the basic freedoms enshrined in the un’s universal declaration of human rights.
15298,state,"i had never wanted to see much of anything on iran’s state-run television, but now i pressed my ear to the door."
15299,cell,i would have watched practically anything rather than be trapped alone in this cell.
15300,cell,"over the past few days, nothing but silence had come from her cell."
15301,freed,she must have been freed.
15302,freed,"i will also be freed—tomorrow, i thought, as i dragged myself back to my blankets and lay down."
15303,question,i knew the answer to this disturbing question.
15304,imprisoned,"my body would be free, but my conscience would remain imprisoned forever."
15305,ward,"part ii  angels in evin  chapter eleven  every time the buzzer to the women’s ward rang that saturday, i longed for it to be my freedom bell."
15306,evin,"i lay on my back all day, pondering what the headlines would be if i ended up staying in evin and my whereabouts became known."
15307,jailed,"jailed in iran,” perhaps."
15308,case,"hard-liners might use it to claim i was a bad muslim, which would worsen my case."
15309,cell,"finally, the door to my cell opened."
15310,freed,"“am i being freed?” “no,” she said, “i’m taking you to meet some new friends.” but i didn’t want new friends."
15311,freedom,i wanted freedom.
15312,cell,"then haj khanom led me out my cell, around the corner, and down another corridor."
15313,inmates,"i couldn’t hear any voices, but i assumed that it, too, held women inmates because haj khanom hadn’t told me to put on my chador and blindfold, as i had by now learned were required outside the women’s ward."
15314,where,“where’s she from?” came an old woman’s voice.
15315,cell,"“why don’t you ask her yourself?” haj khanom said, stepping aside and motioning me into the cell."
15316,cell,"she smiled warmly, took my blankets from my arms, and deposited them on one side of the cell."
15317,cell,"“this is my mother, zohreh,”* roya said, gesturing at another woman settled on several layers of blankets on the opposite end of the cell, which was twice the size of my previous one."
15318,wall,"above her, on the wall, someone had engraved the words viva la libertà."
15319,prisoner,perhaps this cell had once upon a time held an italian prisoner yearning for freedom just as i was.
15320,where,“where are you from?” roya asked.
15321,evin,javan had said no one should even know i was in evin.
15322,freed,"if i told these women the truth, they might inform their interrogators or, once they were freed, others."
15323,murder,"spattering spit on my  cheek, she said, “alcohol is worse than murder!” i turned to see her stern expression crack as she burst out laughing."
15324,detained,"“we were detained a few weeks ago at the airport, along with a few dozen other women and men,” she said."
15325,evin,"“they’re here in evin, too."
15326,authorities,"“well,” roya said, with a soft chortle, “we also wanted to go to ashraf.” now i understood why the iranian authorities had been sensitive about their trip."
15327,camp,"camp ashraf was the headquarters of the mujahedin-e khalq organization, or people’s holy warriors, an exiled iranian group opposed to the islamic regime."
15328,imprisoned,"the mko killed scores of senior officials, and the regime imprisoned and executed many of the organization’s supporters."
15329,war,"in the 1980s, the mko set up a base at camp ashraf near baghdad and fought on iraq’s side in the iran-iraq war—turning many iranians against it."
15330,arrest,"and although america and iran called the mko a terrorist organization, shortly before my arrest the european union had dropped the group from its terrorist list—a decision that enraged tehran."
15331,camp,"but the group’s critics, including former members who complained of abusive and cultlike practices at camp ashraf, disputed this."
15332,evin,"roya and her mother had been planning to visit her in iraq, before they were diverted to evin."
15333,jail,this wasn’t roya’s first time in jail.
15334,prisoners,"she had been incarcerated here twice before—once in the 1980s, when several of her fellow prisoners and her brother, who were members of the mko, were executed."
15335,camp,"the second time was a few years ago, when she returned from a visit to camp ashraf."
15336,sentence,"roya told me our ward was part of evin’s detention center, where inmates usually remained until receiving a sentence."
15337,evin,"last time she was here, she was transferred to evin’s regular prison, which housed hundreds of women."
15338,prisoners,"the food there was repulsive, roya said, and was spiked with camphor to suppress prisoners’ sexual drive."
15339,inmates,"some women inmates suffered from lice, narcotics were just as easy if not easier to get than on the streets, and the guards often treated prisoners much more harshly."
15340,inmates,"but at least in the regular prison, inmates could use the bathroom whenever they wanted and could make phone calls more frequently."
15341,jailed,"“if you ever get sent there,” roya advised me, “try to room with the murderers.” many of them had been jailed for killing their husbands, which they felt was the only way to escape their abusive marriages, she explained."
15342,prisoners,"the murderers, as well as women who were imprisoned for financial crimes, were the most educated, so they were the best choice of cellmates for political prisoners, who didn’t have their own section in the regular prison."
15343,inmates,i had once read that people convicted of narcotics offenses constituted nearly half of iran’s prison inmates.
15344,authorities,"while some international health experts said tehran had made significant progress in combating drug addiction, many critics complained that the authorities were not doing enough to stem the demand for or supply of drugs."
15345,law,"several observers told me the driving force behind prostitution was economic, while government officials tended to blame the phenomenon primarily on “moral decay.” one teenage prostitute i had interviewed in tehran claimed this moral decay existed among some of the nation’s law enforcers and clerics, a few of whom had  been her clients."
15346,cell,"“my interrogators wanted me to denounce the mujahedin’s beliefs, but i told them i couldn’t because i believe in my sister, and i don’t want to denounce her beliefs, whatever they may be.” “how do you keep from going crazy here?” “i pass the time walking back and forth in the cell, reading the koran, and praying,” she said."
15347,cell,it was the same hacking sound i had heard from my cell the previous week.
15348,evin,"their captors had acquiesced, but now they regretted their decision and wanted to expel the older woman from evin."
15349,confinement,"i may not have been free, but for the first time after two weeks in solitary confinement, i was having a conversation with someone other than the men who threw me in prison."
15350,evin,"i wanted to confide in roya, to tell her about the atrocious lies i had told in evin."
15351,cell,"“roya,” i whispered, uncertain whether even in our cell, we were being listened to or watched, “can i tell you a secret?” “sure,” she said, sliding across the floor to me."
15352,courtroom,"“you have no choice now but to maintain that what you said is the truth,” she said firmly, “or your interrogators won’t free you.”  at the far end of the courtroom sat an imposing figure: a white-bearded, white-turbaned cleric perusing some files on his vast desk, which stood on an elevated platform about a foot high."
15353,wall,"behind him, staring down gravely from two framed photographs on the wall, were ayatollah khomeini and his successor, supreme leader ayatollah khamenei."
15354,court,"it was sunday, february 15, the day after i had joined roya and her mother, and i had been brought back to the revolutionary court, to a room on the third floor."
15355,freed,"“no, i am not,” i said, baffled that this man was opening a new line of questioning when i was supposed to be freed any day now."
15356,inmate,"my guard took me to wait for a fellow inmate on the second floor, where i sat on a chair to brood over my encounter with the judge."
15357,freed,"rattled by these thoughts, i told the guard that my interrogator had said i would be freed the day before, and i asked if i could see the magistrate about it."
15358,courthouse,the guard nodded and flagged down a man i recognized from my previous visit to the courthouse as the magistrate’s assistant.
15359,guard,"from my seat a few feet away, i couldn’t hear the guard speaking as he relayed my concern, but i saw the assistant look at me blankly."
15360,evin,"deprived of a mirror in evin, it was the first time i was seeing my reflection in more than two weeks."
15361,freed,“i’m a bit distressed.” “about what?” i told her my interrogator had assured me i would be freed last saturday.
15362,freed,"“inshallah, god willing, you will be freed soon.” iran, i had learned, was the land of god willing."
15363,detention,"she told me if anyone in the women’s ward knew what was in store for me, it would be haj khanom, who was in regular contact with various officials at the detention center."
15364,freed,"who said you were supposed to be freed by last saturday?” javan asked, shooting a spinechilling look at me."
15365,interrogation,"i was back in the interrogation room, where i was now facing my interrogator in his trademark black leather jacket."
15366,freed,"“you told me to tell my parents i would be freed on saturday.” “that didn’t mean you would actually be freed on saturday,” javan said bluntly, as if trying to show off in front of haj agha."
15367,case,"you’re not the only case we’re working on, you know.” i had been wondering what my bâzju did all day, whether he studied u.s. policy toward  iran, pored over e-mails monitored by his ministry, or worked undercover, using his deceptively western image to blend in with unsuspecting young iranians."
15368,arrested,"what reason have you given them?” “that i was arrested because of alcohol,” i replied."
15369,detainees,"that evening, our cell door opened to two other detainees."
15370,arrested,"they, too, had been arrested at the airport on their way to camp ashraf a few weeks earlier."
15371,cell,leila* and elham* hadn’t known each other until they were placed in the same cell on their first night in evin.
15372,arrest,"their interrogators had claimed as evidence the cash they were carrying at the time of their arrest, but the women had argued this money was only enough to cover their personal travel expenses."
15373,cellmate,"i had known only the first line in arabic—the same words javan had made me say to begin the first videotape of my false confession, so my cellmate taught me the rest of it: in the name of allah, most gracious, most merciful."
15374,freed,"she pledged that if i was freed soon, she would do a good deed or religious act whenever she, too, was released."
15375,freedom,"leila missed her television, her crossword puzzles, and her freedom, she grumbled."
15376,detention,she had heard of one woman who had been in detention for nearly eight months.
15377,arrested,"“she was working on some kind of health program when she was arrested along with the alaie brothers, the aids researchers.” i had reported on aids in iran, but i had never interviewed the alaies, two iraniankurdish brothers who were world-renowned aids physicians."
15378,detained,i hadn’t realized a woman had been detained along with them.
15379,sentenced,one brother had recently been sentenced to three years in prison and the other to six.
15380,cell,"she pressed her ear to the barred window in our cell door and whispered, “do you hear that?” a sad melody was rising through the air."
15381,detainees,"it was as if all the detainees and even the guards had been hypnotized by the pure, gentle voice."
15382,cell,"“that’s the woman i was just talking about,” leila told us, leaping away from the cell door as we heard slippered feet approaching."
15383,ordered,"“gather your belongings,” she ordered all five of us."
15384,cell,"prepare to leave your cell.”  where do you think they’re taking us?” i whispered to elham, as we folded our blankets."
15385,transferred,"“i heard skinny tell another guard we’re being transferred to the regular prison,” she whispered back."
15386,freed,how could i be taken to the regular prison when haj agha had told me i was supposed to be freed?
15387,trial,and none of us had gone to trial or even met with a lawyer yet.
15388,cell,"let’s go.” she passed us off to another woman guard, who herded us out of our cell, with zohreh lagging behind, hobbling on her cane."
15389,confinement,"not you.” my four cellmates shambled away, while skinny led me in the opposite direction, toward the corridor where i had been held in solitary confinement."
15390,cell,"halfway down that hallway, she opened the door of a cell and hustled me in, slamming the door behind me."
15391,cell,"as in my last cell, there was hardly enough room for five women to lie down to sleep."
15392,wall,"i wondered how she had managed to get books—and a television set, i noticed, sitting on a chair against one wall."
15393,where,"“where are you from?” the woman asked, as she plopped down beside me, smiling companionably."
15394,sentenced,"“the iranian authorities claimed i wanted to overthrow the regime in a soft revolution.” this must have been the woman who had been here for eight months, the one who had been sentenced along with the alaie brothers."
15395,cellmate,"“what did you say your name was?” i asked, as another cellmate, a slim young woman with short, curly hair, sat down beside her."
15396,where,"just over one year earlier, she had moved to armenia, northwest of iran, where she began working for a u.s.-based nonprofit organization called international research & exchanges board, or irex."
15397,interrogation,they took her first to the esteghlal hotel for interrogation.
15398,authorities,"silva had assumed the authorities had no problem with her work, especially since the iranian government had invited irex staff to visit iran a few years earlier, though that was under reformist president khatami."
15399,evin,"that night, she found herself in evin prison."
15400,arrest,"fortunately, one of silva’s friends was with her at the time of her arrest and reported the incident to their mutual friend, a lawyer."
15401,evin,that attorney came to evin searching for silva but was told she wasn’t here.
15402,court,"he also went to the revolutionary court, but officials there repeatedly claimed that no file existed in her name."
15403,court,"one day at court, the attorney happened to see a folder open to a page with silva’s name on it."
15404,confinement,"“that’s silva harotonian!” like me, silva was put in solitary confinement while undergoing intense interrogation during her first days in prison."
15405,case,"for example, her interrogators wanted her to say the alaie brothers headed the program she was administering, but that wasn’t the case, so she wouldn’t agree to say it."
15406,trial,"only after her interrogation was complete was silva permitted to get a lawyer, and even then, she was hardly allowed to talk to her legal team before her trial."
15407,sentenced,he later sentenced silva to three years in prison.
15408,court,"she appealed the decision and was awaiting the appellate court’s response, which she expected to receive any day now."
15409,freed,"you could’ve been freed and then set the story straight.” silva pursed her lips, then lowered her eyes."
15410,freedom,"“i’m angry i could lose three years of my freedom,” she said, more to herself than to me, “but i’m glad i didn’t do what my interrogators wanted.” the other young woman patted her on the back and said, “you did the right thing, silva.” silva had done the right thing, and i had done the wrong thing."
15411,sentenced,"although silva had been sentenced to three years in prison, at least when she got out of this place, she would have a clear conscience."
15412,prisoners,section 209 is for political prisoners.” my belly flipped.
15413,prisoners,"until now, i hadn’t realized i was in a section specifically for political prisoners."
15414,torture,"i vaguely recalled hearing about 209 before, that it was infamous for the worst kinds of torture."
15415,evin,"not only was i in evin, but i was also in one of its most brutal sections."
15416,locked,my parents would never think to search for me here if they really believed the story that i was locked up for buying alcohol.
15417,evin,"azar,* a good-humored woman in her fifties, had already spent three months in evin."
15418,state,she was arrested along with two of her sons for allegedly possessing some antiques that the authorities claimed were state property.
15419,cell,"when a guard asked if she could give it to inmates in another cell, azar objected."
15420,cell,samira* was the slim woman with short hair who had spoken to silva and me on my first night in the cell.
15421,detained,samira had been detained two weeks earlier.
15422,authorities,"but the authorities, she explained, had thought differently."
15423,arrest,"and bbc persian tv, which had launched shortly before my arrest, was quickly gaining popularity, much to the chagrin of iranian hard-liners who accused the two networks of striving to undermine the regime."
15424,freedom,she didn’t want to risk her freedom—or her mother’s—again.
15425,detained,agents had detained samira’s mother because she happened to be at home when they took samira there to search her apartment.
15426,bail,"samira was later told she could also go free if she promised to never take part in any more we exist activities, which she agreed to, and if she posted bail."
15427,jail,i pitied her for having to stay in jail simply because she could not afford her freedom.
15428,cell,"the other woman in my new cell was vida,* a stout housewife in her midsixties with dark skin and dyed blond hair."
15429,arrested,"she was another member of the group that had been arrested on the way to camp ashraf, where vida had planned to go to see her son."
15430,executed,"after the revolution, the islamic regime executed one of her other sons and her brother, both of whom had links to the mujahedin-e khalq."
15431,toilet,"she was embarrassed, however, to constantly ask the guards to open our door and let her use the toilet, so she often waited restlessly until one of us also felt an urge to go."
15432,detainees,"(every tuesday, detainees were allowed to use their own money to buy a few snacks and raw vegetables through a prison official who brought them from outside evin—although goodies deemed too western, like chips, were not permitted."
15433,guard,"as she chopped lettuce and cucumbers with a dull knife borrowed from the guard on duty, silva would entertain us with stories."
15434,arrest,"“on the morning of my arrest, i got a manicure for my friend’s wedding i was supposed to attend that evening,” she recounted."
15435,imprisoned,"“when i was imprisoned, the guards saw my hands and looked at me as if i was so frivolous."
15436,evin,"after several months in evin, silva was allowed to have a small television."
15437,state,"iran had no private radio or tv channels—only the state broadcaster, the islamic republic of iran broadcasting."
15438,state,"irib’s communications director, whom i had interviewed for my book, had told me that state tv’s main goal was to entertain its viewers so they don’t “go and watch [foreign networks like] bbc.” irib also aimed to educate iranians and promote islam, he had said."
15439,crime,"but i also knew plenty of iranians who doubted irib’s impartiality, especially when it came to playing down iran’s domestic difficulties and highlighting the economic problems and crime in much of the rest of the world."
15440,police,"they preferred to watch foreign tv police dramas, such as the german cobra 11, which were expertly dubbed into farsi."
15441,freed,"i missed fargo and my parents, who must have been extremely worried about why they had no news from me, one week after they had expected me to be freed."
15442,court,"samira was taken to court on sunday, february 22, and returned with a light in her eyes that divulged her good news."
15443,bail,a relative had finally come through with her bail.
15444,cell,"so many women had come and gone from her cell, she said, while she had stayed behind."
15445,imprisonment,"“i really believe this.” maybe my imprisonment was also part of my destiny, i thought, just as moving to iran had been."
15446,authorities,"in fact, if the iranian authorities hadn’t given me a press pass, i wouldn’t have stayed long enough to feel at home in the country and begin writing a book about it."
15447,cell,this confusion was reflected in some words she had scratched into the paint on our cell wall: dear god!
15448,national security,"by claiming that people like her and the alaie brothers were threats to national security, these hard-liners appeared to be attempting to scare iranians away from even the most ordinary connections with america."
15449,court,"the following morning, azar was summoned to court while silva went to her weekly visit with her mother elsewhere on the prison grounds."
15450,detainees,"some detainees, silva had told me, were allowed to get visits from immediate family members, but how long they had to wait for this right to be granted depended on their captors."
15451,cell,both women returned to the cell at around the same time.
15452,bail,"her third son, the cleric, had posted bail for her and her two other sons, and the three would be released shortly."
15453,jailed,azar laughed as she told us how one of her jailed sons had commented dryly to the judge: “prison isn’t as bad as i thought.
15454,where,"finally, we’ve found a place where everything is free!” i doubted the judge appreciated this remark, which ridiculed a famous statement by ayatollah khomeini that water and electricity should be free to the public because iran was awash in oil money."
15455,authorities,"under the islamic republic, these services were subsidized but not free, and critics accused the authorities of squandering oil revenues through corruption, reckless spending, and unwise economic policies."
15456,inmates,"inmates had to pay for items such as tissues, shampoo, washcloths, extra underwear, and sanitary napkins."
15457,escaped,"silva smiled as she listened to azar’s story, but then a tear escaped from one eye."
15458,cell,our cell door opened.
15459,cell,"when braces returned us to our cell, the two women and their belongings were gone."
15460,case,"we presumed she had received a response to her appeal, but we had no idea whether it had been negative, in which case she might have been transferred to the regular prison, or positive, in which case she would have been set free."
15461,cell,"the swift departure of samira, azar, and the bubbly and talkative silva left our cell quiet and gloomy."
15462,taken,"moreover, silva had taken all her books, which i had begun to read, although her tv was left behind."
15463,cell,she wished we would get new cellmates—like the two women she had previously shared a cell with on the other side of ours.
15464,cell,"chapter thirteen  the woman who stood in our cell doorway must have been crying for many hours, perhaps even days."
15465,guard,"when the guard shut the door behind her, she fell onto them and started to weep loudly."
15466,interrogation,i recognized her weeping; it was the same high-pitched wailing i had heard coming from a nearby interrogation room during my first week in prison.
15467,cell,i soon discovered that nargess had also been the one whimpering in the cell behind mine during my first days in solitary confinement.
15468,cell,"instead of being released as i had thought, she had been transferred to another cell down the hall."
15469,prisoners,vida and i were the first prisoners she had seen since her arrest.
15470,evin,"nargess’s interrogator had told her if she didn’t confess to being a spy, she would languish in evin for years or even be executed."
15471,charge,"she told us that despite threats from her interrogator, she had continued to deny the charge against her."
15472,captivity,"he sounded like a tyrant, refusing to set her free although the magistrate she had met on her second day of captivity had ordered her released on bail."
15473,where,"her interrogator had denied her even a single phone call, and she feared that no one knew where she was."
15474,evin,"she had been sitting in his car when two plainclothes agents showed up, forced her into their own vehicle, and whisked her here to evin."
15475,cell,nargess told us she had gained sustenance in her solitary cell by reading the koran for hours on end and praying through the days and nights.
15476,death,"this woman, i realized, loved god so much that she feared disappointing him more than she feared death."
15477,interrogation,“you have interrogation.” i had been waiting for this day since i had last seen my interrogator and haj agha just over one week earlier.
15478,interrogation,i threw on my chador and blindfold and was led to an interrogation room.
15479,interrogation,"after this final interrogation, he explained, he would give my file to the magistrate."
15480,freedom,"i was dismayed by the thought that i would have to keep waiting for my freedom and that my family, bahman, and any friends who realized i had disappeared almost one month earlier would have to agonize even longer."
15481,freed,"“well, i thought i was supposed to be freed by now.” “we’ve been working on it, but these things take time,” he said, as if i should have known better."
15482,interrogation,"we make the decisions around here.”  during this interrogation, i was to repeat my entire false confession about mr. d, the details of which had become even hazier in my mind."
15483,sentences,"every few sentences, javan interrupted me, telling me to replace one word or phrase with another he preferred."
15484,detention,"he even informed me that the most accurate translation for the farsi word mahramâneh was not “secret,” as i had thought, but “classified.” one new question had to do with whether before my detention i had noticed any signs that the intelligence ministry was monitoring me so closely."
15485,arrest,"i told javan and haj agha that i had not, although after my arrest, i had begun to think about the signals i may have missed."
15486,incarceration,this was the first time during my incarceration that my captors had made this accusation.
15487,punishment,others had defied the regime’s restrictions on the press and free speech by writing personal blogs or contributing to foreign news web sites—despite the risk of punishment.
15488,question,"“but why did you report on sensitive topics such as aids in iran?” his question made me wonder whether he had ever read, watched, or listened to any of my work."
15489,prisoners,"he had added, however, that whether and when the concentrated epidemic found among intravenous drug users and prisoners spread to sex workers, homosexuals, and the youth completely depended on the country’s future policies."
15490,power,"and it was people with this kind of mind-set, i lamented, who held so much power in the islamic republic."
15491,cell,javan stood up to take me back to my cell.
15492,cell,"“you should remember,” he said, in a threatening tone, “if you leave this place and tell anyone about our arrangement, be sure i will sign your death warrant myself.”  back in my cell, i cast off my chador and sank onto my blankets."
15493,freed,"after so many unfulfilled promises, it seemed i would really be freed this time, yet i was in no mood to rejoice."
15494,wall,i turned my back to them and stared at the wall.
15495,freed,"i was vacillating between a feeling of hope that i would finally be freed and the idea that once released, i would have to live in fear of haj agha and his henchmen, wherever i happened to be."
15496,freedom,"but mostly, i felt deep shame at the way i was winning my freedom."
15497,freed,vida and nargess had gone through three police dramas by the time i came to a realization that i had been struggling to avoid since my first week in prison: i did not want to be freed for telling lies.
15498,courthouse,"the magistrate was at his desk in his office on the second floor of the courthouse, exactly how i had first seen him nearly one month earlier."
15499,interrogation,"i hadn’t expected to be brought here just two days after my last interrogation, much earlier than haj agha had predicted."
15500,freed,"then i remembered how, nearly two weeks earlier, my guard had told the magistrate’s assistant that my interrogator had promised me i would be freed."
15501,crimes,"if i ignored haj agha’s warning and told the magistrate that my interrogators made me confess to crimes i did not commit, i might lose my chance at freedom."
15502,question,"besides, all these men were intertwined in one way or another, so how could the magistrate not know the answer to his own question?"
15503,war,"“i won’t tell them.” he looked at me intensely but without hostility, triggering a tug-of-war in my head."
15504,lawyer,he was the man who had thrown me into solitary and refused me a lawyer.
15505,prisoners,“haven’t other prisoners been asked to do that?” i asked.
15506,arrested,"i found it hard to believe he wasn’t aware of such arrangements, but i said, “they said i have to spy on foreign diplomats in iran and on americans abroad…or something like that.” “weren’t you afraid you could be arrested by the u.s. government for that?” i didn’t know what to say."
15507,freed,"“well, y-yes,” i stammered, “it would be risky, but my interrogators said this was the price of my freedom.” i thought it prudent not to admit that once freed, i would have never upheld my end of the bargain."
15508,pen,"the magistrate lowered his gaze to his desk and began drumming his pen on a blank notepad, softly and slowly."
15509,bail,then the magistrate asked if i had any property deeds i could put up for bail.
15510,guard,he waved the guard over to take me away.
15511,where,“could i call my parents and tell them where i am?” he blinked.
15512,where,“don’t they know?” i explained that my interrogators had told me to lie to them about where i was.
15513,freed,"“they said if i didn’t, i wouldn’t be freed.”  “if they told you to kill someone, would you do that, too?” i was beginning to think this man might actually have some principles."
15514,guard,"as the guard drove me back to prison, i started to regret that i hadn’t also told the magistrate my confession was false."
15515,ward,"when i arrived at the women’s ward, i asked haj khanom if i could be taken back to the magistrate."
15516,cellmate,"“did they hit you?” the three of us wanted to know, once our new cellmate, sara, had arranged her blankets in the middle of the floor."
15517,arrested,sara told us she was arrested early that morning with her fiancé and two of her girlfriends.
15518,arrest,"sara’s fiancé had resisted arrest, so the men started to beat him."
15519,building,"eventually the agents collected the four friends and forced them into a van, which was parked so close to the apartment complex’s front door that the only way out of the building was into the vehicle."
15520,cell,"now her two girlfriends were in another cell, while her fiancé had been taken to the men’s ward of 209."
15521,detained,"they were active in a leftist student group, had taken part in university demonstrations, and several of their classmates had been detained before them."
15522,imprisonment,"imprisonment, i knew, was one risk iranian students faced for political activism, which had been growing increasingly dangerous—especially after hard-liners expanded their control over universities following ahmadinejad’s 2005 victory."
15523,freedom,"although still loyal to the islamic republic’s main tenets, it turned against conservatives and transformed into a proponent of civil society, pluralism, and freedom of expression."
15524,court,"the next day, sunday, march 1, sara was taken to court and charged with having links to communist opposition groups abroad."
15525,bail,"their two friends, however, were to be released on bail."
15526,jail,she said she had learned from some classmates what to expect in jail.
15527,crimes,"“then,” she had parried, “you must be a member, too.” first roya, then silva and nargess, and now this twenty-year-old student had used a variety of methods to resist their captors’ demands to lie or to admit to crimes they did not commit."
15528,freedom,"they had stood up to threats and pressures knowing that by telling the truth and proclaiming their innocence, they could jeopardize their chances at freedom."
15529,where,"“do your parents know where you are?” i asked sara, wondering if her family, like mine, was in the dark."
15530,arrested,“my brother was arrested last year and was later released on bail.
15531,case,"after that, we decided that in case i was next, he should call me every night at a certain time to make sure i’m ok."
15532,detained,"if my phone is turned off at that time, he should assume i’ve been detained.” sara was concerned, however, that her parents would be terrified their daughter was now reliving their son’s ordeal, so that afternoon, she asked the guard on duty if she could call them."
15533,cell,"when haj khanom brought breakfast to our cell on tuesday morning, sara pushed aside the tray and flatly announced: “i want no breakfast, no lunch, and no dinner."
15534,evin,"“you can’t get what you want here by not eating.” i had never witnessed anyone go on a hunger strike, although i had met and reported on akbar ganji, a famous iranian political dissident who had been freed from evin in 2006 after fasting for more than seventy days."
15535,where,"he later went abroad, where he continued to speak out for the movement of democracy in iran."
15536,evin,"but because no one outside evin knew of sara’s strike, it was difficult to predict how effective the move would be for her."
15537,wall,"i sat facing the wall with my eyes bound in the interrogation room, where javan had summoned me one day later that week."
15538,where,"“does he know where i am?” even if he didn’t know, he must have decided he could no longer stay quiet—ignoring what i had been pressured to tell him by phone nearly three weeks earlier."
15539,question,the interrogator answered my question with an order: “his noise is not helpful for you.
15540,where,don’t tell him where you are.
15541,custody,"on the other hand, media attention, if that’s what my father was drumming up, could compel them to free me sooner—that is, if they even admitted to having me in custody."
15542,case,"in any case, my interrogator was telling me to lie once again."
15543,pen,"i heard a pen drop onto my desk, followed by the swoosh of a piece of paper."
15544,pen,"“write: ‘i don’t want to call my father,’ and sign it.” i lifted my blindfold, picked up the pen, and wrote: i don’t want to call my father unless i am allowed to tell him the truth."
15545,cell,"without another word to me, he instructed a guard to return me to my cell."
15546,cell,"since she had joined our cell, she had begun to appear healthier."
15547,confinement,"her eyes were no longer puffy from crying, and she had regained some of the weight she had lost in solitary confinement."
15548,freedom,"but if the only way i can go free is to lie, then freedom has little value."
15549,case,"“i will pray to god to help you.” then she released my hands, tenderly ran her fingers across the koran and asked, “do you want me to do an estekhâre for you?” estekhâre, i had learned years before, was a muslim tradition of divining answers to questions, in this case, by consulting the koran."
15550,where,"the practice was fairly common in iran, where many people turned to fortune-tellers for answers to their personal and financial questions and problems."
15551,freed,i immediately made two: that no one would ever be harmed because of the falsehoods i had told in this prison and that i would be freed within the week.
15552,question,“how did you know?” nargess smiled as if the answer to my question was obvious.
15553,question,"“make another wish—this time, only one.” i paused, deliberating over whether instead of making a wish, i should ask a question."
15554,question,“may i pose a question instead?” i asked nargess.
15555,jail,"my entire dilemma, i realized,  rested on whether i should let my lies persist or put a stop to them while i was still in jail."
15556,freedom,"in short, should i risk my freedom to pursue the truth?"
15557,sentence,"she recited some more verses, opened the koran again, ran her eyes over the page on the left side, and read the last sentence to herself."
15558,conviction,"finally, she looked up and said with conviction: “do it."
15559,death,tears started to roll down my cheeks as i realized that i had given up the truth on account of fear of man and fear of death.
15560,freedom,"at last, i understood that i had to tell the truth— even if it cost me my freedom, even if it cost me my life."
15561,exercise,"the yard was insulting, sara declared, and it existed only so that prison officials could announce to the world they were humane enough to give us an opportunity for outdoor exercise."
15562,detainee,"a simple phone call to her family, which should have been every detainee’s right, was a privilege that sara was prepared to starve herself to obtain."
15563,pleading,"then it began to ache, pleading with me to soothe it."
15564,awaiting,"by the fourth day, saturday, it had begun to adjust to its deprivations and, except for an occasional grumble, had resigned itself to quietly awaiting its unknown future."
15565,where,"the family had dropped me off at the train station the next day, after making me promise to return someday to travel with them to their small cottage in the north of iran, where we would pick the most succulent wild berries."
15566,court,"thank god!” she had just come back that saturday, march 7, from court, where she had wept before her magistrate, swearing that she was not a spy and had never done anything even remotely political."
15567,arrest,"the magistrate had decided, as he had once before, to release nargess on bail, and she had been permitted to call her family for the first time since her arrest several weeks earlier."
15568,court,"the court would keep the deed to her home until her trial, whenever that might take place—if ever."
15569,cell,"despite these fibs, sara was happy to have spoken to her parents, and she returned to our cell with an exultant grin."
15570,freedom,"for them, freedom seemed within reach."
15571,arrest,"the last thing i wanted to do was spoil my cellmates’ high spirits, so i pressed the black button by our door and waited as glasses, the guard who had been on duty the night of my arrest, appeared."
15572,guilt,"i leaned my back against the wall, buried my face in my hands, and released my tears—tears of helplessness, of guilt, of a profound longing for my family."
15573,cell,"but instead she said softly, “if you’re going to cry, at least do it in the next room.” the next room was the size of one cell, where two big potted plants, a large trash bin, and a water fountain sat on a dirty tiled floor."
15574,prisoners,that was where my fellow prisoners and i were allowed to fill our plastic water bottles and throw out our garbage—tasks we often competed over to break the monotony of our daily lives.
15575,prisoners,"“do some prisoners stay here for years?” i asked, struggling to get the words out."
15576,where,“why doesn’t my interrogator let me tell my parents where i am?” i sniffled.
15577,court,"“you’re going to court.” it was sunday, march 8, the day that haj agha had said i would be sent to the magistrate’s office, where, if i wanted to be freed, i should repeat my confession and agree to everything the magistrate said."
15578,prisoner,"a male guard loaded me into a van, where he handcuffed me to a young woman prisoner i hadn’t seen before."
15579,prisoners,"two male prisoners sat in front of us, also shackled together."
15580,court,"“don’t speak to one another,” the guard ordered from the passenger seat, before we headed out the prison gate and toward the revolutionary court."
15581,guard,"“please give me the strength to tell the truth,” i murmured to myself with my eyes closed, “whatever the result might be.” the guard began to say something to me, but the driver, who must have glimpsed at me in his rearview mirror, interrupted him and said, “let her be."
15582,court,"she’s praying.” with my free hand, i drew my chador over my face and continued, whispering over and over, “please give me the strength to tell the truth, whatever the result might be.” when we arrived at the court about thirty minutes later, the guard unlocked our handcuffs and led us to the second floor."
15583,lawyer,"with his outdated suit, stooped shoulders, and stubble on his chin, the only thing that gave him the aura of a lawyer was his leather briefcase."
15584,prisoner,my guard admonished the man for talking to me and took the other woman prisoner and me into the magistrate’s office.
15585,prisoner,"for the next half hour or so, i waited as the magistrate interrogated my fellow prisoner by having her write down answers to his written questions."
15586,confinement,"through the few words they exchanged, i gathered that the woman had been in solitary confinement for twenty days and was charged with propaganda against islam."
15587,bail,"after the questions finished, the magistrate told her she would be freed on bail that day."
15588,guard,"she thanked him, and the guard took her to sit in the hallway."
15589,jailed,"the magistrate asked me why i had once spoken to the japanese ambassador to tehran at a dinner party, why i had traveled to lebanon, and why i had tried to assist my jailed acquaintance—all questions repeated from my interrogations five weeks earlier."
15590,question,"after i wrote each answer, he would read it, then write down a new question on another sheet and hand it to me."
15591,state,"“how is the state of ohio?” he asked, without altering his tone."
15592,question,“it borders the great lakes.” the magistrate nodded and began to write his next question.
15593,bail,"he had asked me about a deed for bail last time, and now he was talking about my freedom."
15594,question,"i asked myself, as i read the next question: who was mr. d, and what was your connection to him?"
15595,pen,"i sat motionless for a moment, my pen hovering inches above the paper."
15596,locked,"if i wrote the truth, i could remain locked up for years."
15597,freed,"but if i continued to cooperate as haj agha and javan had instructed, i would be freed."
15598,freedom,lies = freedom.
15599,pen,then i pressed my pen to the paper and wrote: neither mr. d nor anyone else has asked me to gather information for them.
15600,interrogation,"what i said in my interrogation about mr. d was false because whenever i told my interrogators the truth—that i was not a spy and was simply writing a book about iran, and that this was a personal project not funded by any individual, institution, or government—they told me they didn’t believe me and that i wasn’t cooperating."
15601,freed,i deduced from my interrogators’ words that i would not be freed unless i told this false story.
15602,state,“out of fear i agreed to state those lies.
15603,prisoners,"without speaking, the magistrate held out a tissue box, as if he was used to dealing with distraught prisoners."
15604,taken,they must have taken at least three or four hours.
15605,interrogation,only after the interrogation was complete did the magistrate allow me to speak to khorramshahi for a few minutes.
15606,lawyer,“who found you for me?” i asked the lawyer with suspicion.
15607,lawyer,"“one of your mutual friends recommended me to him.” i still didn’t know whether to trust this man, and it was disquieting to have heard he didn’t usually cover political cases, but when he told me to sign a form retaining him as my lawyer, i did as he said."
15608,bail,"i then asked him to go to my apartment, find the deed (even if i wouldn’t be freed on bail any time soon), and take out the garbage."
15609,lawyer,"“don’t say his name loudly here.” i couldn’t discern whether khorramshahi meant that talking about bahman would put bahman, me, or the lawyer himself in danger, even though my interrogators already knew about the two of us."
15610,guard,"“it’s time for you to go,” the magistrate said, motioning at the guard to take me away."
15611,where,"“please tell my parents where i am,” i told khorramshahi before getting up."
15612,detainee,the guard led me to the hallway and sat me down next to the other woman detainee.
15613,court,she and i were to wait here for the two male prisoners who had come to court with us.
15614,ordered,"the guard again ordered us not to speak to each other, then positioned himself on a chair a few seats away."
15615,crime,“what crime are you accused of?” the woman whispered.
15616,guard,i glanced at the guard.
15617,guard,he had busied himself with talking to another guard.
15618,detainee,the detainee introduced her as her sister.
15619,detainee,"on the way back to evin, the detainee’s sister joined us in the van."
15620,guard,"oddly, the guard handcuffed me to her."
15621,court,"looking out the window, i took in scenes i had been too unsettled to notice on my way to court."
15622,detainee,"it was the fettered hand of the detainee’s sister, who had reached out to grasp mine."
15623,evin,"she kept clutching my hand, our palms wet with sweat, until we reached evin."
15624,cell,"when i arrived at my cell, i felt much lighter."
15625,jail,"i had no idea whether retracting my confession that day meant i would be stuck in jail for many years, but i no longer cared."
15626,execution,"my parents knew where i was, and the media were covering my story, which made my execution highly unlikely."
15627,incarcerated,"though still incarcerated, i now felt liberated, as if i had transformed into the sparrow’s shadow and finally set myself free."
15628,exercise,"i had learned that if the guards didn’t inform us of our destinations, it was an exercise in futility to ask."
15629,ward,javan was waiting for me outside the women’s ward.
15630,where,“where are we going?” i asked.
15631,arrest,this was none other than the gang that had ransacked my apartment on the day of my arrest.
15632,building,javan handed me my keys and told me to open the door to the building.
15633,case,he didn’t warn me to act naturally in case we came upon any neighbors.
15634,building,"for some reason, just like the last time, no one was in sight—not even gholam, the building caretaker."
15635,arrest,it also appeared that someone had been here since my arrest.
15636,ordered,"“find us the money and the rest of those documents you told us you got from the center for strategic research,” javan ordered."
15637,war,"“give me the one on the u.s. war in iraq,” he said."
15638,where,"then he took me to the living room, where his three associates were lounging on my furniture."
15639,pen,he placed a pen and a sheaf of paper on the counter separating the living room from the kitchen.
15640,pen,"i picked up the pen and started writing: this $2,100 is what is remaining of the $15,000 i received from…i couldn’t do this."
15641,pen,"i set down the pen, looked down, and crossed my arms."
15642,freedom,“because when i told you the truth—that i was just writing a book on my own—you said you didn’t believe me and that i wasn’t ‘cooperating.’ you pressured me to lie and promised me freedom only if i acted according to your demands.” “so why are you telling the truth now?” he asked.
15643,executed,"he extended the pen toward me and said, “then write that down: you are ready to be executed.” “i refuse to write that,” i said emphatically."
15644,freed,i made it up under pressure because my interrogators had told me it was the only way i would be freed.
15645,jail,"he read it, then said darkly, “don’t think that the world will care if you stay in jail."
15646,evin,"i asked them if i could bring back to evin a photo of my family, a little iranian money, and a few books."
15647,prisoners,"in the car on the way back to evin, i reflected on javan’s words: “we knew from the very beginning that it was a lie.” i wondered how often my captors and their colleagues deliberately made false accusations against other prisoners, too."
15648,authorities,"and if the authorities had known i wasn’t a spy, why did they detain me in the first place?"
15649,national security,they could also use my confession to reinforce their claim that america had planted spies throughout iran and to bolster their argument for more restrictions on society in the name of protecting national security.
15650,detention,"in addition, my captors could use my detention to solidify their support among anti-american hard-liners and to scare other dual nationals, writers, and journalists in iran, as well as iranians advocating better relations with the west."
15651,power,"the more i considered these various possibilities, the more i believed that what i had witnessed over the previous several weeks boiled down to an issue of power: certain people in power were exploiting that power to suppress individuals who they feared were threatening it."
15652,court,"call your parents,” a man commanded me, “and tell them you’re fine.” early that morning, i had been instructed to put on my chador to go to court again."
15653,cell,"blindfolded, i had been led downstairs, where a man whose voice i didn’t recognize gave me my cell phone."
15654,court,"“inform your parents you are going to court today and that you’ll be freed in two to three days,” he was telling me."
15655,court,"“they told me to tell you i’m going to be taken to court today and that i’m supposed to be freed in two to three days.” then, without heeding the guard’s order, i added, “but i’m not sure if that’s true.” “but we also heard that you will be freed soon.” “really?” i still couldn’t believe this news."
15656,interrogation,"i made some statements during my interrogation that were not true, but yesterday i finally told the truth."
15657,state,"we are doing as much as we can to help you, and the state department has called for your release.” “the state department?” i hadn’t realized my case had reached that level."
15658,detention,"it was comforting to know i had such support, but i also hated to think that my detention may have created new tensions between the two countries when the possibility of rapprochement had been looking more likely."
15659,guard,“…spiritually and psychologically challenging.” the guard was gesturing at me to hang up.
15660,cell,"i’ll be fine.” as soon as i handed my cell phone to the guard, he demanded to know why i hadn’t followed his instructions."
15661,freed,"“in any case, your interrogator and haj agha said they apologized that it took so long for you to be freed, but they did their best.” i nodded."
15662,freed,so i truly was going to be freed?
15663,prisoners,"the guard led me to a van outside section 209, where several male prisoners were waiting."
15664,guard,"the weather had become a little warmer, and the guard in the passenger seat let us crack open the windows when we got onto the highway."
15665,court,"the guard had brought me to the security division at court, but instead of going to the magistrate’s office, i had been dropped off in a spacious room on the right."
15666,where,"then, without any introduction, the older man started grilling me about where i had grown up, why i had come to iran, whom i had reported for while in iran, why i had “a tendency to write antiregime reports” (though he didn’t give me any examples), and several questions about the book i was writing."
15667,interrogation,"i answered, although i couldn’t comprehend what my lawyer was for when he was absent for yet another interrogation."
15668,freed,"the list of questions continued for some minutes until the older man brought up the tale of mr. d. my confession about mr. d was false, i explained, adding that i had been told i had to make it in order to be freed."
15669,lawyer,"“well,” the older man began, “i was going to free you, but i decided not to anymore.” “why not?” “because last night, your lawyer did two interviews with the media,” he replied casually."
15670,question,"they make statements to publicize themselves.” “i don’t know whether mr. khorramshahi did interviews,” i said, “but even if he did, why should i be punished for it?” he ignored my question and continued, “did you speak to him yesterday when you were with mr. sobhani?” sobhani must have been the magistrate."
15671,freed,"that morning i had been told i was going to be freed, and now i was hearing just the opposite."
15672,imprisonment,"but whoever this man was, he seemed to be more influential than anyone else i had encountered during my imprisonment."
15673,case,"“whenever i decide to free you,” he went on, “i probably won’t let you leave the country for a while, until the media frenzy over your case has died down.” i knew that if he kept me in iran, the intelligence ministry could continue to monitor and intimidate me."
15674,jailing,"haddad is the man whom university students like to criticize for jailing their classmates.” haddad shrugged, as if this accomplishment was all in a day’s work."
15675,jail,"you may think my research and reporting are reason enough to keep me in jail, but what i said here today was the complete truth.” haddad listened calmly, but when he began speaking, a cloud passed over his face: “why is it that the u.s. has guantánamo bay and abu ghraib, yet when we imprison an american woman for one month, the world cries out, ‘violation of human rights’?” by referring to these places, haddad seemed to be taking his resentment against america out on me."
15676,detainees,iran and other muslim countries had been particularly outraged by graphic reports of u.s. soldiers abusing detainees at iraq’s abu ghraib prison in 2004.
15677,detention,"tehran often brought up these reports, as well as allegations of torture at the american detention camp at guantánamo bay, when it accused washington of hypocrisy."
15678,prisoners,"in the van on the way back to evin, my fellow prisoners joked with one another."
15679,cell,"back in my cell, i told my cellmates about my encounter with haddad."
15680,infamous,"he worked under saeed mortazavi, the infamous hard-line prosecutor general of tehran, who was said to get his orders from the supreme leader."
15681,charge,"human-rights activists criticized mortazavi for imprisoning many activists, students, and bloggers, and they accused him of involvement in the death of journalist zahra kazemi, a charge he denied."
15682,bail,"it went something like, you, roxana saberi, will be free don 5 billion rials bail."
15683,freed,but this time i was not only being told i would be freed.
15684,court,"i would have to give the court a deed to property worth 5 billion rials, or around $500,000."
15685,court,"my father’s apartment wasn’t worth that much, but maybe the court would agree to reduce my bail."
15686,cell,"back in my cell, i had not yet removed my chador when braces again appeared at the door."
15687,bail,"i had a meeting with my attorney to discuss my bail, she informed me."
15688,ward,"“but tell him,” she added, as she escorted me out of the women’s ward, “that it has been raised to 10 billion rials.” i struggled to keep track of the zeros as i calculated the amount in dollars in my head."
15689,bail,i had never heard of such a high bail in iran.
15690,building,"khorramshahi was waiting for me when a male guard took me to a small building just inside the prison gate and into a room filled with several cubicles, where lawyers were meeting with their clients."
15691,authorities,"“why not?” he hunched toward me and said in a barely audible voice, “the authorities might monitor me.” my shoulders wilted."
15692,lawyer,"if my lawyer was too afraid to pick up my deed, who would?"
15693,court,"khorramshahi agreed to see if the court would accept only the deed to my apartment as bail, although i would have to wait a few days while he traveled out of town to meet with another client."
15694,guard,the guard soon informed us my time was up.
15695,cell,"i asked for khorramshahi’s cell phone number, but he didn’t have a pen and had to borrow one from a lawyer in the booth behind us."
15696,jail,"“by the way,” i said, as i was leaving, “i met mr. haddad yesterday.” “you did?” “yeah, and he told me he was going to keep me in jail because you had done media interviews about me.” “but i didn’t do any interviews,” khorramshahi said, looking befuddled."
15697,case,"if that was the case, haddad had been lying to me."
15698,freedom,"to celebrate my impending freedom, i decided to attempt to beautify myself."
15699,freed,"after all, i was to be freed by the next week, the start of the nowruz holidays, thirteen days of joy that iranians traditionally spent visiting relatives and friends."
15700,courthouse,i had caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror in the courthouse elevator earlier that week and noticed that i had sprouted a monobrow.
15701,hole,"the guards prohibited tweezers, but sara had filched a piece of black thread a few days earlier, when haj khanom had given her a needle and some thread to patch a hole in her prison uniform."
15702,where,"they had taken me to a local beauty salon, where i had entered a different realm of iranian society."
15703,where,"as i dried my tears, she had laughed and tried to console me with a popular saying among iranian women, bekosh o khoshgel-am kon, “kill me, but make me beautiful.” beautiful for their husbands, beautiful for parties behind closed doors where women often removed their hejab, and beautiful for passersby whose eyes fell upon their uncovered faces in the streets."
15704,bail,"“it said you will be freed in more than a month but less than a year.” that was impossible, i told her, because i was to be released on bail within the next few days."
15705,cell,"“remember,” she had told me before leaving, “i will always be your sister.” the next day, vida was unexpectedly and suddenly removed from our cell."
15706,freed,"sara and i were left to debate whether she had been freed or transferred to the regular prison, where she might meet other relatives of mko members."
15707,cell,"the two of us tried to keep ourselves occupied over the next few days by exercising in our cell and watching tv shows i had never wanted to see when i was free, such as police serials, violent movies, and the prophet joseph."
15708,evin,"this schedule had the added benefit of shortening the longest and worst period of the day: the time between waking up to find ourselves still trapped in evin, and nightfall."
15709,freedom,"iranian women generally enjoyed more rights—such as the freedom to drive, own businesses, and keep their own names at marriage—than many of their counterparts elsewhere in the middle east."
15710,law,"nonetheless, the regime’s interpretations of islamic law helped  to limit other rights."
15711,court,"for example, a woman was entitled to only half the inheritance that a man could get, and her testimony in court had half the weight of a man’s."
15712,imprisoned,"a grassroots campaign had been endeavoring to collect one million signatures to push for changing such laws, even though the authorities had threatened and imprisoned many of its volunteers."
15713,freed,"she had already agreed to her interrogator’s demand that once freed, she limit her activities as a student activist."
15714,cell,"a distant thumping sound, as if someone was getting beaten, was reaching our cell."
15715,ward,"a man was crying out, somewhere beyond the women’s ward, “i’m not a spy!"
15716,cell,“i recognize his voice!” her eyes bolted around the cell until they fell upon an aluminum can of juice.
15717,sink,"she emptied the contents into the sink and twisted the can, tearing it in half."
15718,guard,she asked a guard on duty to talk to her interrogator about this.
15719,jail,"the whole episode made me thankful that at least bahman, too, was not in jail, though i feared my captors may have harassed him in other ways."
15720,situation,"meanwhile, i was starting to get nervous about my own situation."
15721,court,"the last workday before the iranian new year would be in two days, and the court would then close for several days."
15722,evin,"if khorramshahi didn’t deliver my deed by then, i would be spending my holidays in evin."
15723,court,"on wednesday morning, sara was taken to court, while a guard we prisoners had named cheeks, for her chubby face, informed me that i had another meeting with my attorney."
15724,building,"she accompanied me to the building where i had met khorramshahi the previous time and slid into the seat beside me, across the table from him."
15725,evin,"khorramshahi greeted me, then told me the swiss embassy, which represented u.s. interests in iran, had been asking for consular access to see me in evin, but the iranian authorities had not yet granted the request."
15726,lawyer,"i was beginning to think that despite what seemed like his good intentions and kind disposition, my lawyer was too intimidated to fully act in my interests."
15727,court,the court or intelligence ministry must have been threatening him somehow.
15728,bail,"“by the way,” khorramshahi continued, “i asked the magistrate about reducing your bail, but he said your file hasn’t been returned to him yet.” “i don’t get it,” i said."
15729,bail,“i have already signed a form that allows me to be released on bail.” khorramshahi wrinkled his forehead.
15730,charge,"“by the way,” he went on, “what’s the charge against you?” “don’t you know yet?” i asked, astounded."
15731,charge,"“i haven’t been able to see your file.” actually, i wasn’t sure of the formal charge against me, either."
15732,imprisonment,"the only time i had been informed of any charges was on my second day of imprisonment, and back then, i was accused of acting against national security."
15733,penalty,one year?” i was alarmed that my lawyer didn’t seem to know that espionage could carry the death penalty.
15734,imprisoned,"why should i have even been imprisoned in the first place?” “you must continue to have hope,” khorramshahi chided me."
15735,bail,"i had wanted to discuss my case with khorramshahi, now that i had heard the disappointing news about my bail, but we had neither the time nor the privacy."
15736,cell,"but i, it seemed, would be spending my iranian new year in a prison cell."
15737,bail,“where did you sign the form for bail that you mentioned?” cheeks asked.
15738,bail,"when i told jaffari that my lawyer had no news about my bail, he looked baffled."
15739,court,"after a minute or two, he hung up and told me he had just checked with a colleague at the revolutionary court."
15740,ward,"“the magistrate wanted to free you on bail,” jaffari explained, “but mr. haddad reversed the decision.” cheeks said something to me on our way back to the women’s ward, but i was too disheartened to listen."
15741,bail,"now that i was no  longer going to be freed on bail, what would happen to me?"
15742,cell,my cell was empty.
15743,sink,a plastic plate with a few pieces of rice lay in the garbage can under the sink.
15744,wall,"i sat against one wall and began to thump my head lightly on it, as if this would untangle the web of thoughts that my mind was furiously spinning."
15745,sentenced,"i assumed there was a good chance my case would go to trial, where haddad had said he might have me sentenced to two years."
15746,detained,but other detained dual nationals i had heard of had been freed without trials.
15747,bail,"why couldn’t i, too, have been released on bail?"
15748,authorities,"in addition to no longer being able to force me to spy for them, they couldn’t broadcast the video of my false confession with any credibility, now that i had retracted it to the authorities, to my lawyer, and implicitly, to my father."
15749,prisoners,"i couldn’t help thinking that if i had waited to withdraw my confession until after my release, as some previous prisoners had done, i would most likely have been freed by now."
15750,case,"in any case, i wouldn’t learn anything until after the nowruz holidays, which, including the weekends, would last roughly two and a half weeks."
15751,justice,"if god was just, where was his justice?"
15752,question,i was starting to question my pledge to myself to suffer any consequences of telling the truth.
15753,cell,something shiny on the other side of the cell caught my eye.
15754,cell,"people out there were living normal lives, but i could only sit in this rotten cell."
15755,taken,"my brother, who was twenty-five when this picture was taken in 2001, looked skinny."
15756,where,"he had become so conscientious about his own morality and ethics that when i gave him some computer software copied cheaply in iran, where copyright laws didn’t apply to foreign works, he had refused to accept it."
15757,where,eventually i came to jesus’ sermon on the mount: so do not start worrying: ‘where will my food come from?
15758,cell,i heard the door to my cell creak open.
15759,cell,"haj khanom had dropped me off in a cell next to my previous one, which my former cellmate vida had told me she had shared with two baha’i women."
15760,evin,"if i was going to be cooped up in evin, at least i could do something worthwhile for others."
15761,cell,my new cell looked as though its occupants had been living here for a while.
15762,wall,"a row of books lined part of one wall, and a family photo was leaning against them."
15763,cell,"this cell, like my last one, had a television."
15764,question,"the women exchanged glances, as if they had heard this question many times before."
15765,confinement,mahvash told me she had been held in solitary confinement for six months.
15766,arrested,"fariba, who was arrested on the same day as five baha’i men, was in solitary for four months."
15767,cell,"when fariba and mahvash were finally placed in a cell together, they jabbered to each other for forty-eight hours straight."
15768,arrested,"after the islamic revolution, some baha’i leaders had vanished or were executed, and many baha’is were attacked, arrested, and pressured to renounce their faith."
15769,where,"the baha’i community eventually set up its own unofficial university, which mahvash directed and where fariba had earned a degree in psychology."
15770,charges,"they and their five colleagues faced charges such as insulting religious sanctities and espionage for israel, an allegation my cellmates said stemmed solely from the fact that their world headquarters was located there."
15771,charges,these two charges could result in the death penalty.
15772,prisoners,"despite the gravity of these accusations, the prisoners had never been allowed to see their attorneys, abdolfattah soltani and shirin ebadi."
15773,state,"far from posing a threat to the state, mahvash told me, iran’s baha’is were nonviolent and politically impartial, and they denied involvement in any subversive acts against the regime."
15774,imprisoned,"the seven leaders had even agreed to their captors’ demand to dissolve the  national and local baha’i assemblies in iran, but they remained imprisoned, along with nearly thirty other baha’is throughout the country."
15775,authorities,"“we are willing to compromise with the country’s authorities,” mahvash said, “but we draw a line when it comes to our spiritual duty.” “for example,” fariba explained, “the regime doesn’t want us to introduce our religion to others, but we feel it’s our duty to share the tenets of our faith with those who are interested.” as the two women spoke, they began to prepare a salad."
15776,imprisoned,"i explained, telling her and fariba how i had retracted my false confession and how haddad had decided to keep me imprisoned."
15777,cell,"when i was finished, they told me that even after sharing their cell with numerous other women, they had never heard of anything quite like it."
15778,court,"“and the court will be closed for days because of the holidays,” mahvash added, “so your strike won’t have much influence on any officials, if that’s what you’re aiming for.” it would be better, they said, if i waited until the holidays were over, and then, if i was still determined, to begin."
15779,where,"i wasn’t sure when or where mahvash and fariba expected to use their new english vocabulary, but over the next few days, i began teaching them phrases they would need to know in order to shop, cook, and travel, as well as expressions they didn’t really need to know, like how to swear."
15780,pen,the women jotted down the new words with a pen their interrogator had given them after they had spent several months in prison.
15781,cell,"in addition to english classes, which became part of our daily routine, we exercised in our cell for two hours a day and read books."
15782,situation,sticking to a schedule made the time pass  faster and helped us feel as if we were making the most of our situation.
15783,power,"when iran’s revolutionaries came to power in 1979, some of them tried to stamp out pre-islamic traditions such as nowruz, which were seen as challenges to islamicizing the country."
15784,where,"in official documents, where possible, references to iran were replaced with references to islam, and allusions to the persian empire founded by cyrus the great in the sixth century b.c."
15785,war,"just as mohammad reza shah and his father had alienated some iranians by downplaying the islamic aspect of their national identity, the islamic regime began to realize that by slighting pre-islamic iranian culture, it would lose much of the national support it needed, especially during the iran-iraq war."
15786,cell,"just then, the door to our cell opened, and a woman in her thirties with disheveled, long, black hair lumbered in."
15787,cellmate,we rushed to help our new cellmate with her blankets and delicately laid her down on them.
15788,confinement,"her name was parisa,* she murmured, and she had been in solitary confinement since she and her brother were arrested a few days earlier."
15789,wall,"so we propped her up against the wall, and she began to eat—listlessly at first, but with every bite, a little more energetically."
15790,cellmate,"parisa was an office assistant who, like my former cellmate samira, had been a supporter of the we exist movement, led by channel one in los angeles."
15791,authorities,it seemed the iranian authorities had not yet announced it.
15792,freedom,"for example, esfehanis were supposedly stingy and azeris dull-witted, while rashtis were said to allow their wives more freedom than did most iranian men."
15793,torture,“how do you torture a kurd?” i asked.
15794,cell,"we must have appeared to be getting along too well, because early the next week, mahvash and fariba were transferred to another cell."
15795,death,"the guards hardly checked in on her, and i sensed they relied on me to tell them if she seemed on the brink of death."
15796,where,"one day i joined her at the dispensary, where the doctor expressed alarm at her deteriorating condition and said he would schedule an off-site hospital visit."
15797,prisoners,"i then asked if he would permit me to get dental floss, a hairbrush to replace the flimsy plastic comb the guards gave to prisoners, and a soft blanket to cushion my sore tailbone."
15798,inmates,"the doctor said the first two items were banned in 209, and as for the third, inmates simply had to get used to the cement floor."
15799,evin,"the next day, the prison authorities took parisa to a hospital outside evin."
15800,locked,she would rather die than stay locked up in evin.
15801,cell,"when parisa grew too frail to walk down the corridor to the dispensary, the doctor had to come to our cell to examine her."
15802,detention,"another day, she received a visit from a man our guards told us was the director of the detention center."
15803,taken,"the following day, tuesday, march 24, parisa was allowed to call her mother after agreeing to eat a few bites of food, and i was taken by a male agent to call my parents, this time from a phone in a hallway."
15804,trial,"i wasn’t sure if i would be put on trial, i told my father, but i wanted a second lawyer."
15805,ward,“i love you.” “why did you tell him you want to go on a hunger strike?” the man fumed as he led me back to the women’s ward.
15806,case,“your case is already politically sensitive.
15807,cellmate,"after parisa left, i was hoping to get another cellmate, but haj khanom said that depended on my interrogator, who was still out of town."
15808,taken,"perhaps he had taken his family to persepolis, the ceremonial capital of ancient persia’s achaemenian empire."
15809,confinement,these days on my own were much easier than my first two weeks in solitary confinement.
15810,where,"not only did my parents now know where i was, but also i had my books, and i was finding words within them that were helping me put my circumstances into perspective."
15811,torture,"while his destruction of precious manuscripts and renaissance art was deplorable, his experience in captivity struck a chord with me:  savonarola, high-strung and exhausted, soon collapsed under torture, and gave whatever replies were suggested to him."
15812,tortured,"recovering, he retracted the confession; tortured again, he yielded again."
15813,freedom,"since reading this book in college, i had forgotten what viktor frankl, a holocaust survivor, had written about “the last of the human freedoms”—the ability to “choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances…” some of my former cellmates had exercised this ability by refusing to be robbed of their dignity, morality, and inner freedom, despite their difficult conditions."
15814,situation,"i was also calmer this time in solitary because i realized that with the country more or less shut down for the holidays, i could do nothing to alter my situation."
15815,trial,"i was still intent on starting my hunger strike after the holidays, but only if i became certain that my case would be going to trial."
15816,building,the location was so inconspicuous that the two women who had come with me drove past the building twice before we could find it.
15817,building,"but when we passed through the gates, pulled off the sweatpants we had worn under our dresses, and walked into the building, we entered another world."
15818,where,"a live band was playing iranian music, and unlike another friend’s wedding i had attended where the genders were kept apart, here dozens of sweaty men and women were exuberantly dancing together under colorful flickering lights."
15819,where,"the female guests began a high-heeled stampede toward the cloakroom, where most of us had turned in our hejab."
15820,hole,"peering through a hole in the curtain, one guest reported that the musicians had packed up their equipment and disappeared."
15821,detained,"if we were unlucky, we would be detained and given lashings, as one of my friends had after she was caught at a mixed-gender dance party."
15822,evin,"having worked at evin for more than a decade, she was the veteran among her colleagues."
15823,inmates,"she was always the most likely to treat inmates as ordinary human beings, the only guard who would guide blindfolded prisoners by the hand instead of tugging at our chadors or grabbing our arms."
15824,prisoners,"from what i had witnessed, the other guards were usually civil but not always kind to prisoners."
15825,confinement,"on one occasion, i heard a guard rail at a woman who had been crying uncontrollably after months in solitary confinement."
15826,guard,"on another, a guard berated one of my former cellmates for rinsing her hair on an off–shower day."
15827,detainees,"still, the guards seemed to think that i, along with the rest of the detainees, was guilty of some crime."
15828,cell,"a few of them seemed to enjoy their position of authority, such as the power to open and close our cell doors at will and being our only route to the world beyond our cells."
15829,taken,the guards also liked to take advantage of our short exercise periods in the yard to search every nook and cranny of our cells for prohibited pens or notes we may have taken.
15830,serving,"perhaps by reigning over us, the guards believed they were serving god, islam, and the regime."
15831,evin,"i guessed that they, like the interrogators, came from a religiously conservative, lower-middle-class background, or they wouldn’t be working in a place like evin."
15832,cell,"the walls of my cell were to be repainted, presumably to cover the etchings left behind by former inmates, to prevent them from passing on words of solace or guidance that could help new prisoners when they needed it most."
15833,cell,"so after i had spent four days alone, skinny was moving me into another cell in a corridor that she said had previously housed male prisoners."
15834,inmates,"fariba left to scrub the filthy bathroom, which the male inmates evidently had seldom cleaned, while mahvash and i hugged each other with delight."
15835,evin,"the report was so vague that mahvash and i couldn’t figure out who these individuals were, though i guessed the list might include iranian-american student esha momeni, who had been released from evin but was barred from leaving iran; retired fbi agent robert levinson, missing since his visit to iran in 2007…and maybe even me."
15836,situation,"i couldn’t help but wonder how this might affect my situation, if at all."
15837,where,"i had entered a large room full of my high-school classmates and walked past them toward the far end, where i spotted my parents sitting at a round table with their backs to me."
15838,inside,"they were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, warm and fresh with a pinch of salt."
15839,cell,"they stepped out of the cell, looking back at me guiltily, as if it was their fault i couldn’t share in their pleasure of weekly family visits because i had no family members in iran (though i could have seen bahman had we had a temporary marriage)."
15840,cell,"“have a good time.” i was reading a book when, a half hour later, one of the guards opened the cell door and instructed me to get dressed for a meeting."
15841,lawyer,i assumed it was with my lawyer again.
15842,building,"this time, however, instead of being driven to the right, in the direction of the building where i had last met khorramshahi, i was taken to the left, toward another building in the prison compound."
15843,inside,a male guard led me inside and down a flight of stairs to the basement.
15844,building,"i realized they must have just finished their family visitation, and i was in the building set aside for such visits."
15845,prisoners,the guard guided me past them and into a large hall where prisoners were sitting with their families at round plastic tables that looked like cheap patio furniture.
15846,where,"we walked past them to the far end of the hall, where tasbihi was waiting for me, one hand grasping his prayer beads, the other, the knob of a closed door behind him."
15847,authorities,"the first words that left my mouth were, “you came all this way to see me?” and the first thought that raced through my mind was, what if the authorities harm my parents?"
15848,ordered,the agent positioned himself across from us and ordered us to speak loudly.
15849,imprisonment,"i tried to picture this scene—my boyfriend and my parents meeting for the first time, brought together by my imprisonment."
15850,where,"bahman had taken my mother and father to my apartment, where they were now staying, and my widowed neighbor had been keeping them company and cooking their meals."
15851,detained,"it made sense that the regime wouldn’t allow my parents to be detained or killed in one of those mysterious car accidents in iran, now that my case had gained a measure of international attention."
15852,freed,"“until you are freed,” my father said, cupping his hands over mine."
15853,trial,"“i’m not even sure if i’m supposed to be freed on bail or put on trial.” my parents didn’t know, either, and neither did khorramshahi."
15854,trial,"“if i do go on trial,” i said, raising my volume a notch, “i need to talk to the lawyer first."
15855,lawyer,then i asked if they had found a second lawyer for me.
15856,wall,"“and we went to his office and saw that he has many news articles about his work posted on the wall,” my mother added."
15857,cell,"tasbihi interrupted to inform us our time was up, and i would have to return to my cell."
15858,evin,"but i want him to go on with his work, and i don’t want to be an obstacle to his goals.” my father leaned over and whispered to me it would be better not to talk about bahman here, but my mother mentioned he was waiting outside evin with khorramshahi."
15859,evin,"she also told me that several weeks earlier, khorramshahi had come to evin looking for me, and he was told i wasn’t here."
15860,cell,"but for some reason, when i returned to my cell, i felt an emptiness that hadn’t existed just minutes earlier."
15861,trial,my father broke the news to me when i was allowed to call him on thursday: i was to go on trial the next week for espionage.
15862,lawyer,"he told me not to worry, that my lawyer would ask for a postponement."
15863,trial,"in any case, i had no doubt my trial would be closed and without a jury."
15864,court,"khorramshahi was crouching over a far table, taking notes from a thick dossier, when i saw him at court that sunday, april 12."
15865,guard,"we sat down on two chairs, with my guard standing beside us listening."
15866,trial,"“your trial is set for tomorrow,” he informed me."
15867,lawyer,"“but i will request a delay.” “good,” i said, “because most of that file is lies, and i need time to discuss it with you.” then i told him i would like to get a second lawyer, reasoning that two could be more effective than one."
15868,authorities,"i couldn’t start all over with another lawyer, whom the authorities might prevent from seeing my file, or me—or both."
15869,case,i also didn’t know if khorramshahi would share what little he knew about my case with a new lawyer.
15870,arrest,"this was the courtroom where i had been brought two weeks after my arrest, and the man sitting behind the raised desk at the opposite end was the white-bearded, white-turbaned judge who had asked if i had been in contact with foreigners."
15871,charged,"“you are charged with espionage,” he said matter-of-factly, barely giving me a glance."
15872,freedom,“i was pressured to make those statements and was promised freedom in return.” the judge looked at me with hate-filled eyes.
15873,guilty,he seemed to have made up his mind that i was guilty without even questioning me.
15874,guilty,guilty until proven innocent—though i suspected few people were ever proven innocent here.
15875,trial,khorramshahi cut in to ask if we could postpone the trial.
15876,ordered,“just write your request for me.” then he ordered us to leave.
15877,cell,"after i returned to my cell, i skipped lunch and dinner."
15878,trial,"“god is watching over you.”  part iii  on trial  chapter nineteen  i didn’t realize that writing a book was against the law in iran,” i told the judge the next day."
15879,trial,"that morning, judge moqiseh had summoned khorramshahi and me back to the courtroom, where we had submitted our request for a delay of my trial."
15880,court,first came the guard who had brought me to court.
15881,guard,i assumed from the confident way “baby face” carried himself that he wasn’t just a prison guard.
15882,trial,"the sentences were long and complicated, making me wonder whether i should request a translator for my trial in two weeks’ time."
15883,charge,"“you are accused,” heidarifard was now saying, “of acting against national security by way of espionage for the united states.” “do you accept this charge?” judge moqiseh asked me, looking down from his elevated desk."
15884,charge,"“i accept that he says it’s the charge against me,” i replied, nodding at heidarifard."
15885,prosecution,"he read off some statements i had made in my false confession, including that i had received $15,000 from mr. d for using my book as a cover to gather information for him, and as proof, the prosecution had in its possession $2,100 found in my apartment."
15886,interrogation,"“let me remind you that you admitted in your interrogation that you received $15,000 for giving him information.” as he spoke, a chill rippled up my spine."
15887,trial,this was the trial itself.
15888,trial,"the judge had refused to grant me a delay, but he hadn’t even announced that the trial had begun."
15889,lawyer,"my lawyer had  said nothing, and i was totally unprepared."
15890,sentences,"“what you have been reading,” i began, “is—” heidarifard interrupted with a few more sentences of the mr. d tale."
15891,question,"when he paused, i tried to defend myself, but the judge broke in with another question."
15892,freedom,"“i was trying to say that the confession was false, i made it because i was threatened with many years in prison if i didn’t and promised freedom if i did."
15893,illegal,"after a few seconds, he looked up and said, “saberi also met with the american journalist mr. c when he was in tehran.” “is it illegal to meet with an american journalist?” i asked."
15894,war,"from where i was sitting, it appeared to be the research article on the u.s. war in iraq."
15895,where,i couldn’t see from where i was sitting.
15896,guard,it was the prison guard.
15897,conviction,"“but as far as i know, i never had any classified documents,” i said, even though the conviction in moqiseh’s voice was starting to make me doubt myself."
15898,where,he pulled a few articles out of the folder and asked where i had received them.
15899,interrogation,"his name had come up in an early interrogation session, but i never dreamed that my captors would pressure him to falsely testify against me."
15900,lawyer,"she even ate the meals her interrogators provided to her.” then he turned up his nose at khorramshahi and said, “we also request that you prohibit saberi’s lawyer from doing any more media interviews."
15901,case,"this is a security-related case, and his interviews threaten our national security.” khorramshahi shot to his feet."
15902,state,the judge sided with baby face and ordered khorramshahi to abstain from interviews with all media except iran’s state-run news services.
15903,case,"the judge laughed lightly and answered for baby face, “he’s a representative from the intelligence ministry.” “then you must know my confession was false,” i said to the agent, “because when i told your colleague, my bâzju, that i had withdrawn it, he said he had known from the very beginning it wasn’t true.” “if that’s the case, we can ask your bâzju,” the judge said with a smirk."
15904,crime,"there was no truth to this, but i agreed to say it because they promised to release me if i ‘cooperated.’” “by ‘cooperate,’” the judge said, “they meant confessing to your crime.” “they meant confessing to a crime i did not commit,” i countered."
15905,case,we had never been given time to discuss my case.
15906,courtroom,"on the way out of the courtroom, i asked him if he could cross-examine the “witness,” mr. v, but he said that was not permissible, just as he was barred from studying the socalled evidence against me."
15907,guard,the guard separated us before i could ask khorramshahi anything else.
15908,evin,"on the way back to evin, my stomach rumbled loudly, but i didn’t feel hungry."
15909,trial,"the trial was so short, it seemed to have lasted only about half an hour."
15910,lawyer,"although i hadn’t expected much, i never thought it would be so unjust and that i would have to present my own defense as my lawyer merely took notes."
15911,trial,the judge must have made his ruling before the trial had even begun.
15912,cell,"my blindfold, which i tied on every night to block out our cell’s bright fluorescent light, kept slipping."
15913,cell,i returned to my cell and ate two dates.
15914,ward,then tasbihi brought me back to the hallway outside the women’s ward.
15915,evin,"“if you don’t, you can’t.” i agreed, ate lunch, and then, with tasbihi towering over me, called my parents and told them to come to evin."
15916,building,"in the car on the short ride to the visitation building, tasbihi instructed me to pass on a message to my mother and father."
15917,authorities,"the iranian authorities definitely seemed bothered by news coverage of my case, and contrary to what tasbihi was now saying, i had begun to believe this media attention was helping more than hurting me."
15918,imprisonment,"when my parents had remained quiet during the first month of my imprisonment, the authorities had dragged their feet."
15919,building,"tasbihi ordered me to walk behind him when we entered the visitation building, but i skipped ahead to my mother when i saw her waiting in the large hall."
15920,where,tasbihi took us to the same private visitation room where we had met the week before.
15921,case,"it appeared my parents and i were getting special treatment, perhaps because of all the media reports about my case or because we could be monitored more easily here."
15922,trial,"after we sat down on the couch, i told my parents how badly the trial had gone the previous day, although i intentionally kept my descriptions vague in front of tasbihi."
15923,court,"khorramshahi told us about it.” i said i wanted khorramshahi to show me the defense argument before he delivered it to the court, so i, too, could have a say about what was written."
15924,cell,"it could hurt my case.” our time was soon up, and tasbihi told me i had to return to my cell."
15925,sentence,"if the sentence is  bad, and it probably will be, then talk to the media again.”  even though i had, in a way, passed on tasbihi’s message about the media, my captors still were not satisfied, as i learned the very next evening."
15926,wall,"it was wednesday, april 15—weeks since i had last found myself sitting at the school desk in the dreadful interrogation room, facing the wall, blindfolded and unaware of how many men were behind me."
15927,interrogation,"i didn’t know why i had been brought here, and i wasn’t about to let this turn into another interrogation."
15928,exercise,is your outdoor exercise adequate?” i paused.
15929,detainees,"“well, i shouldn’t have any extra rights that other detainees don’t have.” “and you’re feeling well?” i was starting to wonder whether my voice was being recorded to be broadcast later to make it seem as if i was having the time of my life in evin prison."
15930,interrogation,"“excuse me,” i said, “but i thought my interrogation had finished.” “yes, it has,” tasbihi acknowledged."
15931,case,"it is not to your benefit that your case has become so political.” i heard him stand up, click toward me, and throw what sounded like a heap of papers on my desk."
15932,ordered,"“look at these,” he ordered."
15933,wall,i lifted my eyes and stared at the wall.
15934,inmate,"at last, i had learned that engaging in conversation gave interrogators like him an opening to do what they were trained for: to offend, intimidate, and lie; to wear down an inmate’s mind; and to provoke the prisoner with the aim of sparking an instinctively defensive and wordy outburst."
15935,lawyer,“i’ve highlighted the important parts for you in yellow.” he stopped at one article and began to read it aloud: “roxana’s father said her lawyer met with her for the first time today.
15936,torture,the lawyer said she showed no signs of physical torture but initially appeared very depressed.
15937,state,he continued reading: “secretary of state hillary clinton announced the u.s. will ‘use any means’ to free you.
15938,building,"but this display of news articles was building me up, not breaking me down."
15939,prisoners,“i would like the same right i have seen granted to some other prisoners: to call my parents once a week on a set day without having to ask you for permission every time.” javan paused.
15940,prisoners,"“do you know why?” “because you think prisoners will kill themselves with it.” “yes, there was an incident some time ago…” “well, if someone really wanted to kill herself, she could use the straps of her blindfold,” i pointed out."
15941,interrogation,"then again, these people had spoken so explicitly about sex in one of my interrogation sessions."
15942,pen,"“what about a pen?” i asked, trying to change the subject."
15943,case,"i wanted to mark important points in my books, i told him, without adding that i also needed it to take notes on my case in the margins, where i hoped the guards wouldn’t think to look."
15944,cell,tasbihi ordered me to lower my blindfold before i got up and walked toward the door to return to my cell.
15945,cell,"“roxana,” mahvash cried, “i can’t believe you said that to him!” i was back in my cell, where i had recounted for my cellmates my latest run-in with javan."
15946,detention,"perhaps some of them were among those in the iranian diaspora spreading news about my detention— that is, if they weren’t too afraid their families would face repercussions back home."
15947,where,"it was saturday, april 18, and i had been brought back to the courthouse, where khorramshahi and i were now sitting before the turbaned judge."
15948,lawyer,"the ruling was fairly long, and i knew it would take me several minutes to read, so i asked my lawyer to summarize it."
15949,jail,"i was trying to find a number—one, two, however many years i was supposed to remain in jail."
15950,lawyer,maybe i hadn’t heard my lawyer correctly.
15951,trial,"after a farce of a trial, what else should i have expected but a joke of a ruling?"
15952,where,"“why?” with nothing to lose now, i figured i might as well tell him, though i hardly knew where to begin."
15953,trial,"“because you didn’t give me a chance to discuss my case with my attorney, and he saw my file only one day before the trial."
15954,trial,"i didn’t even realize the trial had begun until several minutes after it started, you didn’t grant us the delay you promised, and my coerced false confession was used against me.” by the time i finished speaking, the judge’s face had grown contorted."
15955,ordered,"“don’t sign it,” i ordered."
15956,pen,his pen was poised above the blank space at the end of page two.
15957,trial,"before leaving the courtroom, khorramshahi showed me a copy of the brief defense he had turned in after my trial."
15958,guard,"the prison guard was telling me i had to leave, so khorramshahi quickly explained that he had argued i didn’t have any classified materials, my confession was false, and i was simply writing a book."
15959,guard,not important.” the guard gestured at me to leave.
15960,building,“he’s waiting outside the building.
15961,courthouse,"“tell them all i love them and that i’m fine.”  as i was led out of the courthouse, i scanned the parking lot with blazing eyes, yearning to find bahman."
15962,ordered,"“get in the car,” my guard ordered me."
15963,evin,his image played over and over in my mind on the way back to evin.
15964,court,"he had put himself in a great deal of danger by showing up before at evin and now at court, and seeing him for the first time after all these weeks stirred emotions that i had been trying to repress to better cope with prison."
15965,sentence,"i couldn’t imagine how he, my family, and my friends would handle the news of my conviction and sentence."
15966,sentence,"i also believed my eight-year sentence could create an even bigger international uproar than if i had been given only one or two years, and it had erased any inkling in my mind that i might be treated fairly."
15967,lawyer,judge moqiseh had given my lawyer twenty days to submit a request to appeal the verdict.
15968,case,"in the meantime, i would expand my defense team, a wish that khorramshahi had this time respected without threatening to take himself off the case."
15969,courthouse,"i had told him before leaving the courthouse that i wanted to work with shirin ebadi and her colleague abdolfattah soltani, who were representing the baha’is."
15970,charged,"both attorneys had spent time behind bars for their work, but once freed, they had continued to take on tough, politically charged cases."
15971,lawyer,"i had heard this lawyer’s name before but knew nothing about him, so i told khorramshahi to focus on retaining soltani."
15972,court,"the appellate court certainly wouldn’t reduce my eight years to nothing, i predicted."
15973,court,"at best, the court would give me a couple of years in prison, and then i would have to appeal again, but to the supreme court."
15974,authorities,"it was the only weapon available to me to pressure the iranian authorities in the next, critical stage of my case."
15975,authorities,"but if i began right away, the authorities might not allow me to see my parents or soltani."
15976,sentence,"today was the western media’s turn to speak out against the eight-year sentence of roxana saberi, who was convicted of spying for the united states,” i was surprised to hear the tv anchor say on sunday night."
15977,case,this was the first time i was hearing news about my case on irib.
15978,interrogation,he had taken me into an interrogation room and asked whether i had watched the news the night before.
15979,sentence,"he kept asking how scared i was after receiving an eight-year sentence, and i kept repeating a farsi saying, har chi khodâ salâh bedoone, or “whatever god deems advisable.” i had gleaned from this encounter that irib had reported on my verdict the previous night, probably in a way that the agent thought would intimidate me."
15980,sentencing,"tonight, a roughly three-minute report followed the anchor’s introduction, showing snippets from western tv reports about my sentencing and a sound bite from a european friend named coco, who had once lived in iran, declaring that it was unfortunate i had become a political pawn."
15981,building,"i could see the anguish in my parents’ faces from across the hall, where they were waiting when i entered the visitation building."
15982,prisoner,my father was speaking to an elderly woman who must have been another prisoner’s mother.
15983,court,"inmates’ family members, i had learned, got to know one another during their visits to prison and court, creating a growing network of people united in their resentment against their loved ones’ captors."
15984,conviction,"javan had taken the place of tasbihi that monday, two days after my conviction, to monitor my weekly visit with my parents."
15985,case,"i had planned to spend my precious few minutes with my parents discussing my case, but before i could speak, javan pulled a chair up to my father and began talking to him in farsi."
15986,ordered,"the agent claimed he didn’t understand any english and ordered me to speak only in farsi, although he would allow me to translate for my mother, who understood only a few phrases of the language."
15987,power,"he had held a great deal of power over me, and now he wanted to rule over my parents, too."
15988,guilty,"while i was talking to her, i overheard javan tell my father i was guilty of the accusations against me."
15989,evin,"“and when you say these things, you paint a bad picture of evin.” “the world has heard about what goes on here, like the death of zahra kazemi,” i said."
15990,allegedly,this was the first time i had heard a number put on these allegedly classified materials.
15991,lawyer,"we’ve learned what to do.”  i also told my mother quietly in my broken japanese, “tell the media that from thursday, tâbemâsen, i won’t eat.” i hoped by then i would have seen my new lawyer."
15992,case,"i had decided not to wait any longer to protest my verdict, despite learning that both president ahmadinejad and judiciary chief shahroudi had made encouraging statements about my case."
15993,sentence,"irib reported that shahroudi had ordered a “careful, quick, and fair” appeal of my sentence."
15994,justice,"and ahmadinejad had requested that iran’s judiciary ensure justice and a fair investigation into my case and that of the iranian canadian hossein derakhshan, who had become known in iran as the blogfather after helping to popularize blogging in the country."
15995,arrest,his whereabouts had been unconfirmed since his arrest in november 2008.
15996,detention,"regardless of whether ahmadinejad had known of my arrest all along, perhaps he now viewed my detention as an obstacle to improving relations with the united states."
15997,jail,"but even if ahmadinejad and shahroudi had meant what they said, i had no way of knowing how much power even they held over the hard-liners who seemed bent on keeping me in jail."
15998,detention,"when i informed haj khanom of my decision to go on a hunger strike, she handed me a piece of paper and told me i had to formally notify the director of the detention center."
15999,pen,"haj khanom retrieved the paper from me but forgot the pen, which i tucked under my blankets."
16000,cell,"a few minutes later, she was back at our cell."
16001,where,"haj khanom led me to a room on the first floor, where a man’s voice instructed me to remove my blindfold."
16002,cell,"i recognized the director from the last time i had seen him, when he had come to my cell over the new year’s holidays to check on my diabetic cellmate."
16003,cell,"then he informed me that if i went on a hunger strike, he would have to relocate me from my cell to another section, where i would have to spend my days with nâjur, or uncongenial women."
16004,cellmate,"i assumed he meant the regular prison, where my first cellmate roya had suggested i room with the murderers."
16005,sentence,i am on a hunger strike to protest the unjust sentence i have been given.” he eyed me curiously.
16006,where,"lying down, though, had become uncomfortable because i couldn’t figure out where to place my hands."
16007,prisoner,"i was too feeble to walk during havâ-khori, but one day mahvash and fariba helped me go outside, where i sat and watched them as they circled the concrete yard, kicking a deflated plastic ball another prisoner must have left behind."
16008,where,"as they passed it back and forth, i couldn’t help thinking that just three months earlier, i was sprinting across a soccer field at a european school in tehran, where i could take off my headscarf and play with men, both iranians and foreigners."
16009,cell,"despite my discomfort, i was encouraged to know that i wasn’t waiting idly in my cell, relying solely on supporters outside evin to push for my release."
16010,authorities,"i predicted that if i could sustain my hunger strike, the iranian authorities would either have to hook me up to an intravenous drip every few days—which could turn into a public relations nightmare for them—or set me free."
16011,death,"if they did, however, after all i had seen in this place, i had come to believe that death under these circumstances would not be meaningless."
16012,death,"i had gone from fearing death to being ready to die for a cause, a profound change brought on by my captors themselves."
16013,charge,"otherwise, my cellmates were as serene as ever, even when heidarifard, haddad’s assistant, informed them one day that they faced a new charge: spreading corruption on earth."
16014,charge,"my cellmates told me this charge, like two others they faced, could result in the death penalty."
16015,convicted,"in fact, several baha’is in the early years of the revolution had been convicted of spreading corruption on earth and executed."
16016,freedom,"“of course we miss our families and our freedom,” mahvash said,  “but we believe in love and compassion for humanity, even for those who wrong us.” i told them that i realized one should, as the saying went, hate the sin, not the sinner, but it took enormous effort not to feel hatred toward javan, haddad, heidarifard, judge moqiseh…for what they had done to me and likely done to countless others, and i couldn’t grasp how i was supposed to love mankind when i despised these people."
16017,tortured,"“especially you, fariba.” she had told me her father had been tortured in prison years earlier and died shortly after his release."
16018,justice,“we don’t want to become like them.” “but what about justice?” i asked.
16019,justice,"don’t you ever wonder if they will be brought to justice?” she smiled and answered softly, “we hope god will help us show them a better way.”  as the week passed, i grew impatient to hear when i would meet my new attorney, but no news came."
16020,basij,"basij members i interviewed said they voted for him because they admired his simplicity, honesty, and self-proclaimed battle against corruption."
16021,power,"if ahmadinejad won again this year, the basij, revolutionary guards, and hard-liners who backed them would likely gain even more power during his second term than they had during his first."
16022,institution,"the guards, which was thought to have around 125,000 active members, was the islamic republic’s most powerful military institution and had oversight of the country’s nuclear program."
16023,national security,an ahmadinejad victory would allow these forces to further limit domestic freedoms under the guise of protecting national security.
16024,prisoners,that would not bode well for political prisoners like us.
16025,prisoners,"in the meantime, however, my cellmates and i hoped ahmadinejad’s government would release some prisoners as a goodwill gesture in the run-up to the june election."
16026,cellmate,"in late april, we were joined by a new cellmate."
16027,confinement,"but as i got to know mahshid najafi, i realized she simply craved conversation following a month and a half of solitary confinement."
16028,freedom,"fattahi promoted spiritual freedom and criticized the use of violence in the name of  religion, mahshid told me."
16029,state,one iranian i had met who had become disenchanted with the state’s ideological islam was a young father named farzad.
16030,state,"* he considered himself religious, but he preferred to worship within his own home rather than at state-sponsored friday prayers or in the mosque, settings that he saw as a show of support for the regime."
16031,authorities,"in the name of islam, the authorities have told many lies."
16032,poverty,"they promised economic welfare, but instead they have brought corruption, inflation, and more poverty and prostitution."
16033,authorities,"given hard-liners’ rigid views of religion, i wasn’t surprised to hear mahshid say that over the years, the authorities had curtailed el-yasin’s activities."
16034,detained,they had shut down the community’s ngos and publications and detained some of the group’s supporters.
16035,detained,"mahshid told me the group’s leader, fattahi, was now detained in evin."
16036,detention,"he had been held in solitary confinement for the previous few months, and el-yasin members feared he was undergoing severe torture, as they said he had during his previous detention in 2007."
16037,state,"she was now accused of propaganda against the state, a charge she said stemmed mainly from interviews she had done with foreign media, including voice of america."
16038,arrested,"since mahshid and her son were arrested without a warrant on march 2, they had not had any contact with each other or with their families."
16039,freed,"her interrogator pressured her to make false statements about herself and fattahi, but she refused, even though she could have been freed in return for making a false confession, as had at least two other el-yasin members."
16040,incarceration,“i will not sell my dignity at any price.” mahshid had an exceptionally positive attitude toward her incarceration.
16041,guard,"“we can make paradise for ourselves,” she liked to say, “even in hell.”  keep your feet up!” a male guard was hollering in the corridor behind us late one night."
16042,inmate,it sounded as though the guard was yelling at an inmate who had just had his feet flogged.
16043,prisoner,we couldn’t hear the prisoner respond.
16044,wall,"for hours after that, we lay awake, not speaking but knowing that each of us was suffering in our own way with the unknown man on the other side of our wall."
16045,building,"it was early evening on sunday, april 26, and she and a male guard had driven me to another building on the prison grounds, one i had never been to before."
16046,inside,"then, without any explanation, she had given me the bouquet and told me to walk inside."
16047,where,"i wobbled into a small room, where i was startled to find my parents."
16048,authorities,i refused to allow the authorities to record video of me happily embracing my parents with flowers in my hands.
16049,where,"i sniffed their sweet fragrance until i reached the entrance to section 209, where the male guard confiscated them."
16050,case,"“with the attention that your case has received,” fariba said, “you have been given an opportunity to highlight the issue of human rights in iran.” “roxana,” mahvash added, her face turning serious, “when you go back to america, please tell others that our country is not only about the nuclear issue."
16051,ordered,"braces had ordered me to speak only in farsi and stressed that my father, not i, must translate for my mother."
16052,death,"“i am even ready for death,” i declared."
16053,authorities,"i wished i could tell her that even though i was prepared to die, the authorities probably wouldn’t let me."
16054,arrest,“this is the first time i’ve cried since your arrest.
16055,imprisonment,"i knew that my imprisonment had been rough on my parents, but until now they had hardly revealed their suffering."
16056,cell,"chapter twenty-two  skinny inspected my hair, pants, and socks when she fetched me from my cell, as the guards normally did whenever prisoners went in and out of section 209."
16057,inside,"but this time, she even peeked inside my underwear."
16058,lawyer,"i had woken up early that tuesday morning to review what i wanted to say to my new lawyer, soltani, whom my father had told me i was to meet at the deputy prosecutor’s office that day."
16059,trial,"i knew this would probably be my only chance to talk to soltani before my appellate trial, so i had to be prepared."
16060,pen,"with the pen haj khanom had forgotten the week before, i squiggled a few notes on my arm."
16061,case,"i did this under my blanket, in case one of the guards spotted me through the peephole."
16062,court,two guards drove a male prisoner and me to the revolutionary court.
16063,inmate,"when we got out of the car, i noticed that my fellow inmate was limping."
16064,cell,i wondered whether he was the man on the other side of our cell whose feet had been flogged.
16065,where,"i don’t think they’ll let me die.” the guard stepped forward, rebuked me for speaking, and led me to the office of haddad’s secretary, where i was to wait until the deputy prosecutor arrived."
16066,guard,"a water cooler stood near my chair, but i was too proud to ask the guard for a drink."
16067,guard,"he strode up to the guard, held out his identity card, then said beseechingly, “please let me speak to this woman to convince her she must start eating.” the guard jumped up, grabbed bahman by the arm, and pulled him out of the room."
16068,ordered,"“hunger strikes have no effect on our decisions,” haddad continued, then picked up his phone and ordered his secretary to tell my father and khorramshahi to enter."
16069,lawyer,"when they did, haddad said to me, “i hear you want a different lawyer.”  he had spoken these words pointedly, as if he wanted to imply that i was ungrateful for khorramshahi."
16070,lawyer,"“i don’t want a different lawyer,” i clarified."
16071,lawyer,"“i want a second lawyer.” “why?” “because i believe one plus one can equal three, not two.” haddad’s jaw hardened."
16072,taken,"“you can have any attorney but him.” “why?” i asked, taken aback."
16073,lawyer,you can have any lawyer except for soltani.” i wasn’t going to give up this easily.
16074,court,"then he said, “if you take soltani as your attorney, i will prevent him from ever meeting you, and if the appellate court rules in your favor, i will e’terâz, i will object.” i looked at him, flabbergasted."
16075,trial,"“then i will take mr. dadkhah and mrs. ebadi.” since my father had brought up dadkhah’s name before my first trial, i had learned from my cellmates that he was soltani and ebadi’s colleague at the center for human rights defenders."
16076,authorities,"the authorities had shut down the center’s office in december 2008, but its lawyers were still taking on new cases."
16077,case,"“they will not help your case.” then he added, enunciating each word, “they—will—only—hurt—you.” i pressed some more."
16078,trial,khorramshahi said nikbakht had already been helping him prepare for my next trial.
16079,trial,"“if i take nikbakht, will i be allowed to meet with him before my trial?” i asked haddad."
16080,guard,my guard had already warned me not to talk to anyone on the way out.
16081,killing,“it’s killing me to see you  suffering like this.
16082,pleading,"please.” the guard turned to admonish him, giving me a chance to mouth, “it’s ok. i’m strong.” bahman kept pleading with me as i entered the elevator."
16083,cell,mahshid was sitting by herself in our cell when i returned.
16084,cell,"mahvash and fariba had been transferred to another cell, she told me."
16085,cell,"i felt totally helpless, trapped in this stinking cell without a way to tell the public the truth."
16086,court,it said he claimed i had accepted the accusations of espionage activities and that the court had no evidence i had any nationality other than my iranian one.
16087,trial,"“you don’t know when your trial will be, and you’ll need enough energy to make it until then.” she had a point."
16088,guard,"mahshid would stand up and hit the black button, which in itself had become a struggle for me, and i would wait until a guard ambled down the corridor to open our door."
16089,toilet,"there, i would squat with my head over the toilet and dry heave."
16090,cell,"we won’t tell anyone.” “no,” i croaked, and stumbled back to my cell."
16091,where,"the next day i was taken back to the dispensary, where this time i let the doctor attach me to the iv."
16092,taken,"i was sure if he had taken any longer, my bladder would have burst."
16093,wall,"it was monday, may 4, and he was sitting on a chair across from me in the visitation room, with nothing but a thick wall of silence between us."
16094,question,but then i realized this was an opportune moment to ask him a question that had been on my mind for weeks.
16095,crime,"without hesitating, he replied, “because lying to the authorities is itself a crime.” “what a stupid answer,” i muttered."
16096,interrogation,"“sorry,” he said in farsi, “i don’t understand english.” “how is it that you don’t understand the language now, but you were correcting my english statements in interrogation?” i asked him, still speaking in english."
16097,cell,the time soon came for me to return to my cell.
16098,trial,"but i had already made it through two weeks of fasting, and i was afraid if i quit now, no one would take me seriously if i had to start again after the appellate trial."
16099,cellmate,i talked all this over with my cellmate.
16100,trial,she urged me to stop so that i wouldn’t collapse before my trial.
16101,trial,"i would need my strength for my trial, he said, which he had just learned would take place in eight days, on may 12."
16102,question,"haddad laced his hands together on his desk, tilted his head to one side, and asked, “what exactly is your relationship with bahman ghobadi?” this question caught me off-guard."
16103,interrogation,"“we were…contemplating marriage,” i said, repeating the answer i had given during interrogation."
16104,lawyer,"it was wednesday morning, may 6, and he had summoned me to his office for what i thought was to be the meeting he had promised i could have with my new lawyer, nikbakht."
16105,wall,i had sat down several feet away in the row of plastic-covered chairs against the wall.
16106,authorities,"i watched him speechlessly, astonished that after more than three months, the authorities were finally permitting bahman and me to meet with each other."
16107,imprisoned,he felt he had also been imprisoned because he could never rest while i was behind bars.
16108,evin,"to feel closer to me, he would pace back and forth outside evin for half an hour every night."
16109,detained,"“roxana,” bahman said, dropping his voice to a whisper, “i don’t want you to worry, but you should know that intelligence agents came after me a while ago, beat me up, and detained me in a private house in northern tehran for four days.” i squeezed his hands."
16110,freed,"bahman had remained quiet, hoping i would soon be freed."
16111,sentence,"after my eight-year sentence, however, he had gone to the media and written an open letter calling for my release."
16112,court,"i was about to speak when haddad said, “miss saberi, why don’t you just tell the truth in court?” anger overcame me as i spun around to face him."
16113,court,haddad seemed to be saying he knew i wasn’t a spy and was telling me what i should say in court.
16114,jail,"get out of jail and out of the country while you can, then tell your side of the story.” perhaps the best thing to do, i thought, would be to ask my new lawyer, nikbakht, what he thought about haddad’s suggestion."
16115,case,"“i would like a third lawyer, mr. dadkhah.” haddad frowned, then repeated his previous warning that human-rights lawyers would make things sholugh, or confused, and harm my case."
16116,trial,"besides, with my trial in less than a week, i doubted i could find anyone else by then who would meet with haddad’s approval."
16117,court,"another english-language headline rolled across the bottom of the tv screen that saturday, informing me of my future: “appeals court to hear case of jailed u.s. reporter on sunday.” i was alarmed."
16118,trial,my trial was supposed to be two days later than that.
16119,case,"i would ask for a postponement, but just in case my request was denied as before, i decided to prepare my defense on my own."
16120,pen,"the guards had confiscated my pen, so i ran through the major points in my head, forming acronyms to remember them."
16121,trial,"this was all i felt i could do to get ready for a trial whose verdict, like my last one, may have already been determined."
16122,courthouse,i had been driven that day to an austere courthouse in southern tehran.
16123,trial,"“dad,” i called out, as my guard hustled me past the group, “i’m not ready for the trial."
16124,guard,i haven’t met with mr. nikbakht yet.” the guard led me down a hallway and into a room on the left.
16125,courtroom,it was a small courtroom with a few rows of chairs facing a slightly raised platform topped with three desks.
16126,trial,"then baby face, the representative from the intelligence ministry who had taken part in my first trial, entered and sat down in one of the rows behind me."
16127,trial,"i watched this procession from the edge of my seat, distraught that all the pieces were being put in place for another trial i was not prepared for."
16128,trial,“could we please delay the trial?
16129,prosecution,"i have not yet had the chance to speak to my new lawyer.” “no,” he said abruptly, “but you can talk to him during the few minutes the prosecution needs to prepare itself.” protesting, it seemed, would be useless."
16130,sentence,"the trial court, he would contend, had not had grounds to sentence me for “collaborating with a hostile state,” in this case the united states, because washington and tehran could not be defined as being hostile toward each other."
16131,trial,"i didn’t know what this had to do with my trial, but i gave him the answer i had always given, that “we were contemplating marriage.” then the judge announced that the trial was starting."
16132,pen,"this time, i requested and was given a pen and paper to take notes."
16133,prosecution,heidarifard began by reading off the prosecution’s accusations against me.
16134,trial,"he said i had ties  to the aspen institute, which he claimed, as he had in my previous trial, was striving to overthrow the islamic regime in a soft revolution."
16135,trial,"“her goal through these activities was to collect news about u.s.-iran relations to give to organizations in the united states.” finally, heidarifard quoted mr. v, whom baby face had brought up at my first trial, as admitting to having given me many classified documents, allegedly at my request, because he was smitten by my “feminine attractiveness” and i had supposedly promised to marry him."
16136,term,"secondly, i didn’t promise to marry him, and we were just dust-e âdi, ordinary friends.” “you were what?” the judge asked, as if he had never heard this term before."
16137,illegal,v said the two went to a restaurant together.” “is it illegal to have lunch with a friend?” i asked.
16138,authorities,"i was sure the judge knew very well that if the authorities really enforced that, iran’s restaurants would go out of business."
16139,prisoner,and what would he say if i told him i had recently heard that a woman prisoner at evin had been freed only after agreeing to have sex with her interrogator?
16140,locked,"“i find these accusations insulting.” referring to a verse i had read in the koran, i added, “and according to the koran, you need four witnesses to prove illicit relations.” heidarifard lowered his papers and locked his small, round eyes on me for a few seconds."
16141,case,then he looked back at the judge and announced that he was resting his case.
16142,law,i again wished i had studied iranian law.
16143,trial,"i touched on the aspen institute, restating what i had said during my first trial, and i described my book and the types of news reports i had prepared, none of which amounted to a cover for anything."
16144,war,"no sooner had these words left my mouth than heidarifard thrust his fist into the air, gripping the article on the u.s. war in iraq, and announced, “miss saberi said she copied  this report and got it at the center for strategic research.” “there was nothing on that report to indicate it was classified,” i said, as calmly as i could."
16145,sentence,"not only was the center filled with moderates, but hard-liners had also accused one of its directors of espionage in 2007, though he was later given a suspended sentence for a lesser charge and resumed his work there."
16146,state,"khorramshahi rose to his feet and gave a five-minute argument, similar to what nikbakht had earlier read to me about the united states not being a hostile state."
16147,court,"“none is classified,” the tall judge said, “except the one on iraq—according to the trial court.” i couldn’t help rolling my eyes."
16148,case,"in any case, miss saberi apologizes for copying it and had no bad intentions.” actually, i had not apologized."
16149,trial,he must have been waiting for me to say what we had discussed before the trial.
16150,case,"in any case, i didn’t use it, i didn’t plan to use it, and i didn’t give it to anyone.” there."
16151,confinement,"the agent also repeated his claim that i had been under no pressure when interrogated and that i was questioned in a “completely friendly atmosphere.” this time, i reminded him that i had been held in solitary confinement for two weeks, barred from having a lawyer, blindfolded, questioned by four men, repeatedly threatened, and cut off from the outside world."
16152,prisoners,"baby face replied only that such treatment was “natural for security prisoners.” the tall judge then asked several questions about my book and wanted to know why i had interviewed “so many people.” time passed quickly, and when the trial was finished, i discovered that it had lasted around four hours."
16153,trial,"like my first trial, it was badly flawed."
16154,prosecution,"neither my lawyers nor i had been able to examine the supposed witness, mr. v, or what the prosecution called evidence (al though my attorneys had not even asked for permission to do so), but at least the two judges had not cut off my statements as judge moqiseh had."
16155,trial,i couldn’t tell by looking at my lawyers what they thought of the trial.
16156,courtroom,"as i was leaving the courtroom, the shorter judge, who had sat mutely most of the time, held up his palm to stop me."
16157,guard,"“your next book,” he said, with a quiet, sinister laugh, “should be about guantánamo bay.” the guard led me back down the deserted hallway, my father and friends nowhere to be seen."
16158,cell,"whatever the result of my appeal will be, i told myself that night in my cell, i must do my best to accept it with strength, courage, and patience."
16159,sentence,"i expected my sentence to be reduced, but i didn’t know by how many years."
16160,sentence,"i vowed that if i was given a short sentence, i would try to make the most of my experience with the women in the regular prison."
16161,sentence,"if i was given a long sentence, i would resume my hunger strike."
16162,cell,"she entered our cell the next morning, clicking her fingers above her head and performing a little iranian dance."
16163,freed,"still on her feet and panting, she told me she had just had her first family visit with her husband, brother, sister, and son, who had been freed some days earlier."
16164,freed,"“and,” mahshid added, with sparkling eyes, “my sister has read online that you will soon be freed.” i yanked her down to the floor."
16165,freed,maybe it had actually quoted khorramshahi saying he hoped i would be freed.
16166,court,and how could the court have reached a decision so fast?
16167,court,"instead of being driven toward the visitation building, however, i was handcuffed and taken off evin compound, toward the appellate court where i had been the day before."
16168,guard,my driver today was my guard from the previous day.
16169,police,"when a diligent police officer stopped our car, the guard roared at him to mind his own business."
16170,arrest,"as we tore around a corner, the driver yelled back at me, “were you the winner of a beauty pageant?” this was the first time since my arrest that anyone had raised this subject."
16171,courtroom,"this time when i entered the courtroom, only the tall judge was there, and he allowed the two guards to sit in the back."
16172,sentence,"i heard him say something about “islamic forgiveness,” a suspended sentence, and not being allowed to work as a journalist in iran for five years."
16173,freed,would i really be freed?
16174,jail,i wouldn’t believe it until i was out of jail and with my parents.
16175,evin,"“we can’t believe you were freed,” the driver told me, as we set out toward evin."
16176,sentence,"“yeah,” his colleague added, “we didn’t think eight years would be reduced to a suspended sentence.” i hadn’t either."
16177,where,"their bantering continued until we reached a narrow street near the prison, where the driver stopped in front of a bakery."
16178,guard,"the guard in the passenger seat hopped out, bought a large stack of steamy white bread, and offered me some."
16179,prisoners,"i had heard that captors often warmed up to prisoners who were about to be freed, so that when they were released, they would be less likely to badmouth prison officials."
16180,court,“were you at court today?” skinny asked me when i arrived at the women’s ward.
16181,case,"i could tell by the inquisitive look on her face that she wanted to be the first to find out about the latest development in my case, which i had discovered the guards had been following as closely as the prophet joseph."
16182,freed,"“what do you mean?” “i mean, i’m going to be freed,” i replied, a smile stretching across my face."
16183,cell,skinny didn’t say anything else as she ushered me into my cell.
16184,serving,"i realize i am serving a purpose by being here, perhaps even more than if i would be outside.” she was smiling broadly."
16185,cell,our cell door opened.
16186,prisoners,"“gather your belongings,” skinny ordered me in the same tone as always, “except for your blankets.” i had heard her and her fellow guards say this to so many other prisoners, and now she was saying it to me."
16187,cell,"when i was ready, skinny pulled me out of the cell, without giving me a chance to hug mahshid one last time."
16188,cell,"she led me down the corridor, past a few chadors hanging on the wall next to cell doors with their barred windows sealed shut."
16189,prisoners,i wondered when the prisoners who wore those garments would be freed.
16190,inmates,i had often heard the rustling of trash bags that signaled other inmates going home.
16191,detention,she told me i still had to wear my blindfold as she took me to the office of the detention center’s director.
16192,evin,i just wanted to get out of evin.
16193,guard,"skinny left me in another room with a male guard who returned my tote bag, laptop, flash drive, and some of my books and notebooks."
16194,evin,"he said my bâjzu wasn’t at evin that day, and my passports and cash, as well as the rest of my belongings, were in his hands."
16195,guard,the guard told me to check back in a day or two.
16196,tortured,"“now don’t go around telling people we tortured you here,” he said, as he dropped me off at a van outside 209 and told me i was free to uncover my eyes."
16197,gate,another guard drove me toward a prison gate i had not seen before.
16198,gate,"“we’re taking you to another exit,” he explained, “so that the journalists at the main gate won’t see you.” the van’s windows must have been tinted, because as we pulled up to my parents, i could see them waiting for me, but they couldn’t see me waving at them."
16199,guard,"the guard let me out, and i hugged her tightly, soaking up the scent of her freshly shampooed hair."
16200,guard,"my mother was so happy, she tried to shake the hand of my guard, who, flustered at the possibility of a nâ-mahram woman touching him, offered her his wrist."
16201,gate,"i climbed into the back with my mother, and we pulled out of the gate."
16202,evin,"as we entered an alley behind evin prison, i looked over my shoulder at the tall walls and barbed wire."
16203,prisoners,"epilogue  my tears were of both joy and sorrow: joy at my freedom but sorrow for the prisoners of conscience i was leaving behind, who were being punished simply because of their peaceful pursuit of basic human rights or for their beliefs."
16204,freed,why was i freed while many others were not?
16205,where,"on may 11, the day of my release, i stayed at a friend’s home while my parents returned to my apartment, where a neighbor had reported that several journalists were camped out."
16206,authorities,"i wasn’t ready to face them, and i knew that the authorities would be closely monitoring my every word."
16207,freedom,"news of my freedom was all over the satellite tv networks, and both local and foreign journalists wanted to interview me."
16208,where,the manager of an office where i had some business called his wife and child to come from home to get their picture taken with me.
16209,jail,"and when i returned to my apartment complex through the back door that day, my neighbors, even the ones who had been too frightened to visit my parents while i was in jail, said they had prayed for me."
16210,authorities,"other than these brief encounters, as well as a message of thanks that i shared with journalists on my second day of freedom, i tried to maintain a low profile, not wanting to give the authorities any excuses to hold on to my two passports."
16211,evin,"my father went to evin twice to try to retrieve them, but he was told that my bâzju was unavailable."
16212,incarceration,"when i saw bahman, we spoke for hours, trying to catch up on all that had happened during my incarceration."
16213,case,"we talked softly in case his apartment was bugged and hurriedly, as if we feared being pulled apart again at any moment."
16214,authorities,"it was openly critical of iran’s sociocultural restrictions, and he predicted that the iranian authorities would give him an even tougher time after that."
16215,ordered,"“miss saberi,” he said breathlessly, “you are not allowed to leave the country!” my mother collapsed onto the floor, and the man ordered us to move to a lounge to avoid creating a scene in the middle of the airport."
16216,court,"after he woke up his superiors at their homes, he realized what we had been telling him—that the court had not barred me from leaving iran—was true."
16217,where,"a few hours later, we arrived in vienna, where we rested for about a week at a friend’s home before returning to america."
16218,imprisonment,i now relished the freedoms i had taken for granted before my imprisonment.
16219,state,"one of the first people i contacted was mr. d. when i explained the terrible falsehoods i had been pressured to state about him, he was truly understanding."
16220,prisoners,"“if that tale helped save your life,” he told me, “then i am glad.”  since those early days, i have been gaining new perspectives on my experiences by speaking to former prisoners, human-rights advocates, lawyers, analysts, and others who followed my case."
16221,prisons,i discovered that what happened to me was remarkably similar to what many people in iranian prisons endure.
16222,torture,"human-rights activists call the mix of intimidation and persuasion that i experienced “white torture,” which does not leave a physical mark but devastates one’s mind and conscience."
16223,prisoners,"numerous prisoners have suffered harsher treatment; some have reacted much as i did, others have not."
16224,confinement,"many people detained in iran are held without due process of law, their whereabouts are kept secret, they are placed in solitary confinement, and they have little or no contact with their families or attorneys."
16225,torture,"they often suffer severe psychological—and in some cases, physical—torture aimed at forcing them to make confessions and to write or speak about their friends and colleagues."
16226,detained,"some, like iranian-canadian journalist maziar bahari, who was detained for 118 days in 2009, have been pressured, as i was, to become agents of the regime."
16227,detained,"the world heard much more about the use of such methods in the aftermath of iran’s disputed june 12, 2009, presidential election, when thousands of people were detained and dozens killed during the most significant civil unrest since the islamic revolution."
16228,prisoner,"a presidential candidate reported prisoner allegations of rape and sexual abuse, and the authorities acknowledged that at least three people died in custody, although human-rights groups say the death toll was likely higher."
16229,crimes,"a number of journalists, reformist politicians, student activists, and dissidents prosecuted in mass show trials were portrayed in the iranian media as confessing to crimes against the islamic republic."
16230,jail,"more than eighty people received jail terms of up to fifteen years, and several defendants accused of taking part in protests following ahmadinejad’s reelection were sentenced to death; at least two have been executed."
16231,prisoners,"just as i was, many prisoners have been warned that if they did not confess and repent, they wouldn’t be released, and their loved ones could be harmed."
16232,detainees,"some former detainees have reported being forced to sign confessions they were not even allowed to read, while others, like me, were guided by their captors about what to say, or they negotiated with their interrogators over the content of their statements and whom they would implicate."
16233,prisoners,"as author and historian ervand abrahamian explained to me, interrogators often give prisoners a list of topics they should mention but let them write their own confession in an attempt to make the wording fit the victim, sound believable, and therefore serve as a tool for swaying public opinion."
16234,prisoners,"as a result of these tactics, captors such as mine like to claim they never force anyone to make a false confession and that prisoners confess voluntarily."
16235,prisoners,"omid memarian, a former iranian journalist who was detained and coerced into making a false confession in 2004, told me that interrogators rarely believe the confessions they force out of prisoners, just as my bâzju eventually admitted knowing from the start that mine was not true."
16236,freed,the fact is that they have freed several supposed spies and people who have allegedly acted against national security.
16237,prisoners,"you even smell your own fear.” not all prisoners, however, are pressured to confess."
16238,prisoners,"for example, high-profile activists, political figures, and people such as silva harotonian and me who have had contacts with americans are more likely to be coerced to confess than are lesser-known prisoners, such as most of my other cellmates."
16239,prisoners,some prisoners have been released relatively quickly after making confessions.
16240,freedom,but making a confession does not always guarantee freedom.
16241,arrested,"iranian-american scholar kian tajbakhsh, who was released soon after his so-called confession was broadcast in 2007, was arrested again in 2009 and according to iranian media, confessed that american institutions like the nonprofit he once worked for were involved in attempting a soft revolution against the regime."
16242,sentence,"he was later sentenced to fifteen years in prison on various charges, including espionage, before an appeals court reduced his sentence to five years."
16243,prisoners,amnesty international has reported that numerous prisoners in iran have even been executed with confessions extracted under duress used as the sole evidence against them.
16244,prisoners,"some prisoners have retracted their confessions before their release, though this can jeopardize their chances at freedom."
16245,authorities,"in my case, i unknowingly recanted shortly after deputy prosecutor haddad had publicly announced i would be released within a few days, evidently prompting the authorities to reverse this decision."
16246,prisoners,"many other prisoners have waited to recant until they were freed, and still others have remained quiet."
16247,prisoners,"whether or not prisoners recant, their confessions are widely doubted by ordinary people in today’s iran."
16248,prisoner,"as author abrahamian says, many see such confessions as a sign of being human rather than as a sign of weakness, and they are likely to ridicule the interrogator while pitying the prisoner."
16249,detainees,"i have also understood more about another form of white torture—the practice of pressuring detainees to write about people they know, often forcing them to write lies."
16250,prisoners,this is required especially of prisoners who are considered social hubs or who have had contacts with many people.
16251,prisoners,one reason interrogators collect even seemingly insignificant information is to scare future prisoners into talking by making them think their captors know more than they actually do —a method i later realized my interrogators used with me.
16252,inmates,"during this part of interrogation, many inmates are coerced to say they had intimate relations, whether true or false."
16253,detained,"roozbeh mirebrahimi, an iranian journalist and blogger detained in 2004, told me he was forced to make false sexual confessions."
16254,prisoners,"according to mirebrahimi, “they want to shatter your character by making you accept these allegations so that you will break and stop resisting during later stages of interrogation.” i have also learned that some prisoners have been falsely accused, as i was, of having classified documents."
16255,trial,"shortly after my release, i was surprised to hear that my attorneys had begun to announce to the media that i had copied a classified document, contradicting what they themselves had said at my trial."
16256,authorities,perhaps they were intimidated by the iranian authorities or colluded with them to try to discredit me.
16257,authorities,other attorneys have told me that some iranian lawyers face such severe pressure from the authorities that they sometimes sacrifice their ethics and responsibilities to their clients.
16258,detained,"this was the case with human-rights advocates abdolfattah soltani and mohammad dadkhah, who were both detained for several weeks after the june 2009 election."
16259,lawyer,"by then, i had talked to various iranian legal experts, including nobel peace laureate shirin ebadi, whom haddad had warned me not to retain as my lawyer."
16260,crime,"as ebadi told me, “it was all a trick.” maybe, in the end, the iranian authorities promoted this falsehood as my main “crime” because amid the international outcry, they were hoping to save face by presenting a pretext for my imprisonment other than a confession whose validity i had denied while still in custody."
16261,arrest,many people have asked me if i understand the reasons behind my arrest.
16262,incarceration,"so my captors must have had other motives for my incarceration, such as possible political reasons, wanting to justify their investment in monitoring me, and making demands such as having me spy for them."
16263,authorities,they also seemed extremely bothered by the fact that i could move freely around iran to interview people in their own language and without a government minder for a book the authorities could not censor.
16264,trial,"the decision to free me, i have heard, was likely made even before my appellate trial."
16265,case,"when i was released, there was speculation that tehran and washington may have reached some kind of behind-the-scenes deal, but i have been told by officials close to my case that this was not so."
16266,detained,"and when, in july 2009, america handed over five iranian officials it had detained in northern iraq, the state department denied that this was linked to my release."
16267,trial,"mahvash sabet and fariba kamalabadi, along with their five male baha’i colleagues, remain in evin’s section 209, after appearing before judge moqiseh at the first, closed-door session of their trial in january 2010."
16268,sentence,"silva harotonian was transferred to the regular prison after her sentence was upheld on appeal, as were those of the alaie brothers."
16269,parole,they are out on parole and waiting for the last stages of a pardon.
16270,court,"mahshid najafi, my last cellmate, was released on july 18, 2009, but her file remains open, and she awaits a court hearing."
16271,evin,the authorities have confirmed that iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan is in evin prison.
16272,evin,"omid reza mirsayafi, another blogger and a journalist, died under suspicious circumstances inside evin while i was there, on march 18, 2009."
16273,arrested,"numerous other journalists were arrested after the 2009 election, making iran the world’s largest prison for journalists, according to reporters without borders."
16274,confinement,"and while iranian-american student esha momeni was allowed to return to the united states in august 2009, three american hikers who iranian authorities claimed illegally crossed into iran from iraq the month before were detained in solitary confinement and accused of spying, a charge their families and friends say is ridiculous."
16275,prisoners,"i hope that day will be what one iranian friend called “a time when everywhere [in iran] will be safe and prosperous, and we will have no political prisoners.” “you must return,” he said, “because iran is your father’s country and because your name is iranian, and you are iranian.” i remain proud of my iranian roots, and it pains me to see the suffering of iranians who endure repression and brutality when peacefully standing up for fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression, association, and assembly."
16276,authorities,i do believe that certain iranian authorities are genuinely trying to address some of their country’s human-rights violations and shortcomings.
16277,power,"however, they face fierce opposition from extremists who seem blinded by their own pursuit of power and their failure to recognize that the key to long-term security lies not in control and intimidation but in tolerance, an exchange of ideas, and winning the hearts and minds of disaffected groups and independent thinkers."
16278,suppression,"while suppression might silence people in the short run, it breeds discontent and distrust toward the regime in the long run."
16279,where,"it can also push advocates of moderate change underground, where they might turn from evolutionaries into revolutionaries."
16280,evin,"i can’t help it, just as i can’t help having occasional nightmares about my time in evin."
16281,prisoners,"like many former prisoners, i have emotional scars such as these to deal with, but the lessons i gained from my experiences and my cellmates are helping me heal."
16282,imprisoned,"while i wish i had never been imprisoned, i realize my captivity has created this interest."
16283,arrested,"that’s because although i had witnessed injustice before i was arrested, i never really understood it—until i lived it and felt the pain of others who endure and stand up to it."
16284,taken,"i would not have moved to iran if simon marks had not taken a chance on me by sending me to tehran to become the first iran correspondent for his agency, feature story news."
16285,imprisoned,"thank you, simon, for having confidence in me, for paying me to do something i loved, and when i was imprisoned, for helping to coordinate efforts for my release with several news organizations."
16286,authorities,"special thanks to abc, bbc, fox news, npr, pbs, and the wall street journal, which along with simon issued a joint statement to iranian authorities on my behalf."
16287,case,several wrote reports and editorials that sought to humanize my case.
16288,case,"reporters without borders devoted considerable time, energy, and resources to my case and drew public attention to it in creative ways."
16289,detention,"human-rights activists and groups, such as amnesty international, human rights watch, and the international campaign for human rights in iran, also played an invaluable role by raising awareness, advocating on my behalf, and keeping the media spotlight on my detention and prosecution."
16290,situation,"i also thank the team of volunteers who set up the freeroxana.net web site, which kept a blog on my situation and allowed individuals to sign up for a hunger strike in solidarity with me, just after the one by reporters without borders began."
16291,freed,"thank you to all those who signed petitions and wrote letters, fasted, took part in rallies and vigils, prayed for me, and once i was freed, sent me congratulatory e-mails, cards, and flowers."
16292,where,"the north dakota and minnesota communities, fargo-moorhead residents, and the fargo va medical center, where my mother works, were enormously understanding and generous."
16293,imprisonment,"the miss north dakota and miss america organizations, the aspen institute, and rotary international, which all knew me before my imprisonment, were also among the many groups that called upon the iranian authorities to release me."

16367,gate,"suddenly, i was pushed through the gate and the door was slammed behind me."
16368,jail,"after more than eight years, here i was, finally, out of jail, in this other world, and there they were, my parents, older and smaller yet still familiar."
16369,where,we walked toward the main street where we could take a cab.
16370,cellmate,i did not get the chance to say good-bye to my cellmate or leave my money for her.
16371,cell,but i was preoccupied with the reality inside the prison cell.
16372,guilt,"my heart was torn between contradictory feelings: guilt for putting my family through so much fear, hardship, and humiliation, and anger for feeling betrayed because my father had negotiated my temporary release against my will."
16373,sentence,"3  4  prologue  “i will not go home before i go to the cemetery,” i responded, and continued the rest of the sentence in my mind, “to visit hamid, my husband, and my other friends’ graves as i have promised them.” the deep fear in my parents’ eyes became more transparent as they feigned calmness and content."
16374,arrest,"both times, my arrest occurred after the harshest crackdown on opponents under each regime, yet at the beginning of changes in prison conditions."
16375,arrest,"my arrest in 1977 took place at the end of the most severe phase of political suppression by mohammad reza shah pahlavi’s regime, which followed the first armed struggle of a leftist guerrilla group, sazman-e cherikha-ye fadayee-e khalgh-e iran (iranian people’s self-sacrificing guerrilla organization) in 1970, and was intensified between 1974 and 1976 when the leftist-leaning islamic organization, sazman-e â�mojahedin-e khalgh-e iran (iranian people’s warriors’ organization) also joined in militant activities against the regime."
16376,jail,"during this period, arrests and executions reached a new pinnacle and incredibly horrific means of torture were utilized to force the detainees to confess even to the most trivial “accusations” or “crimes.” for instance, goli, the woman i met in jail then had been severely tortured and sentenced to ten years for having owned, read, and passed along a book of fiction, cheshmhayash (her eyes), written by the â�leftist-leaning author bozorg alavi."
16377,prisons,"within prisons and the country, which had itself turned into a larger prison, the ambiance felt deadly suffocating."
16378,arrest,my arrest coincided with the end of this period of extreme brutality and the beginning of a new phase when physical torture was less commonly employed during interrogations.
16379,prisoners,"obviously, this did not prevent the regime from subjecting prisoners to this so-called white, or soft, torture."
16380,prisoners,"it did not stop the regime, for example, from forcing prisoners to stand on their feet for days and nights, violently waking them up every time they seemed to have fallen sleep or when moving one leg up to give it a rest."
16381,cell,"she was brought to my cell, only for about half an hour, in the early weeks of my imprisonment in 1977."
16382,torture,i never found out whether my encounter with her resulted from a simple mistake by a guard or if it was an intentional act to intimidate me by making me witness the gruesome consequences of this “white” torture.
16383,cell,i asked her whether she was the woman i had been seeing since the day of my arrest every time i was taken out of my cell for the toilet or interrogation.
16384,question,"she moved her eyelashes up and down as a way of offering a positive response to my question, but suddenly her eyes took flight, perhaps to the dream world."
16385,wall,"for a few minutes, her stare remained frozen on the wall."
16386,imprisonment,"later, during my second imprisonment (1983–1992), under the islamic republic, i would meet several prisoners who had mastered this “skilltrick” of sleeping while awake and being awake while asleep."
16387,punishment,"pori, who had spent ten months during 1983–1984 in the so-called tabootha (graves) or dastgahha (machines), the extreme punishment ward in ghezel hesar prison, was one of those prisoners who had challenged the boundaries of sleep and waking states, stretching their threshold."
16388,detainees,"this was particularly in response to the fact that, time and again, i came to hear debates about the practice of enhanced interrogation techniques exercised on detainees arrested in relation to the u.s. “war on terror.” rather than a discussion of ethics, these debates basically revolved around such questions as whether or not these measures could be considered torture and if they were effective."
16389,detainee,"politicians concerned with such techniques mainly asked, for example, whether or not performing waterboarding on a detainee more than eighty times produced the kind of result that was worth damaging the image of the united states in the world."
16390,torture,those who discussed and wrote about these techniques in so much detail did so perhaps without having ever been haunted by the frozen stare of a woman or a man subjected to these methods of torture.
16391,arrest,"by the time of my arrest in early 1977, when i met the woman whose name i never learned, the old-style, hard-core torture was giving way to  prologue  7  the white, nonphysical interrogation techniques."
16392,prisoners,the regime could now claim that prisoners were no longer tortured.
16393,torture,"as long as one’s legs were torn apart not by the heavy strikes of cables on the soles of the feet but rather by forced standing on them, no torture had occurred."
16394,where,"in today’s world in which machines, technologies, and devices seem to be doing all the work, where hands have nearly become the extensions of technology rather than the other way around, any production without devices and machines may easily be construed as nonwork, nonproduction."
16395,arrested,"but when i was arrested, i knew nothing of these changes."
16396,jail,the atmosphere in the society out of which i was taken to jail felt heavier than ever.
16397,jail,"my knowledge of prison and torture amounted to no more than a few banned books and pamphlets i had read; some horrific stories i had heard on the underground radio broadcasts from outside iran; and plenty of rumors circulating within iran, which were substantiated during family gatherings by whispers about distant young male relatives who had emerged from jail but remained mute and lost, with deformed feet and their toenails having fallen off."
16398,detention,"no wonder therefore that when i found myself in the komiteh-ye moshtarak-e zedd-e kharabkari (united anti-sabotage committee), a notorious detention center built under the shah’s regime on the site of the former central prison, my then young heart vacillated between pausing for breath and pounding heavily."
16399,cell,"i still vividly remember that as i read the carved writings of legendary dissidents on the walls of the cell into which i was thrown after my interrogation, i simultaneously felt proud, burdened by the responsibility of living up to the level of their resistance, and somewhat out of place."
16400,jail,but the timing of my arrest would save me from witnessing or being subjected to some of the most horrific devices of torture that had severely scarred many women arrested earlier whom i would meet in jail in the next two years.
16401,detainees,"for since early 1978, having agreed that political prisons could be inspected by the red cross, the shah’s regime could no longer use its old torture devices to inflict overt torture or enduring pain on detainees."
16402,torture,"8  prologue  it did not take long for this place to once again fully function as a torture chamber, now by the islamic republic and under a new title, komiteh-ye touhid (unity committee)."
16403,torture,"if under the shah the function of this torture chamber was to use the regime’s penal system against its political dissidents, whom they tortured or eliminated under the guise of fighting kharabkari (sabotage), under the islamic republic the interrogators crushed their opponents under the pretext of extracting satan from their souls."
16404,torture,"through torture or killing, they brought the lost souls of dissidents into unity with god, or so the name unity committee implied."
16405,arrest,"a haunting detour i did not experience interrogation under the unity committee, for my arrest in early 1983 was not made by the revolutionary guards of the islamic republic, who ran the infamous unity committee and oversaw all its interrogations and torture."
16406,notorious,"rather, i was hunted down by the revolutionary public persecution of tehran, which ruled over the notorious evin prison."
16407,arrested,"in 1983, on the way to evin, i was driven through the piche toubeh (repentance curve), the name the agents who arrested me used to refer to the last curve of the road before reaching the prison."
16408,prisoners,"in evin also, as piche toubeh suggested, prisoners were to either be killed or become repentant."
16409,torture,"i visited this site of death and torture, which until recently had been in use by this very regime."
16410,state,"from the ominous clouds that were rapidly gathering over the iranian political scene, one could easily anticipate the rising of new waves of state violence."
16411,dungeon,"with an eerie feeling, i thus read my name on the wall of this once horrific dungeon, along with the names of many others who had inhabited this place under the shah’s regime."
16412,prisoner,"hesitantly, i signed my name, fearful that the guard might check the records and realize that i had been a prisoner of both regimes."
16413,detainees,"in this place only a few years earlier the interrogators of this very government had ushered many of their opponents into “unity with god.” these detainees were either eradicated or were forced to live a “bare life,” as walking dead."
16414,torture,"it was partially a result of this brutal suppression of dissidents in the first ten years following the revolution that, in the early 2000s, the islamic republic felt confident enough to make a spectacle of the shah’s torture chamber while remaining entirely silent about the death, suffering, and destruction that occurred there by its own hands."
16415,prisoner,"in this journey through the labyrinth of the museum of information i was accompanied by a woman friend, ferdous, who was also a former political prisoner but interrogated and tortured in the unity committee."
16416,where,the bitter taste in my mouth from witnessing the nearly absolute erasure of the history of the leftists’ resistance and suffering under the united anti-sabotage committee and an exaggerated predominance of religious clergy presented in this museum became unbearable when ferdous recalled the different spots where she had been interrogated and beaten.
16417,torture,"they ran around, laughed loudly, and screamed almost hysterically and playfully as we shivered to our bones at the horrific sight of the human-size statues that too closely represented victims of torture and their torturers."
16418,prisons,"the boys’ mockery reminded me of a more bitter parody, that of a dream that was once expressed by some of us during those elated moments of the victory  10  prologue  of the revolution of 1979 of the possibility of a day when all the shah’s prisons would be turned into museums."
16419,torture,"now here we were, walking around this prison-museum, whose opening to the public felt like a slap in the face, considering that both ferdous and i had lived through the torture chambers of this regime."
16420,prisons,"i was dumbfounded by the cynical depiction in this prison-museum, not merely in its blunt silencing of some experiences while highlighting others but also by the way it continued to exercise violence in other prisons when turning this one into a museum."
16421,jail,"through transforming this jail into a museum while maintaining and even expanding others, the regime at once ignored and reenacted the beheading of all those dreams of a brief moment in the “spring of freedom,” following the 1979 revolution, when the idea of closing prisons and opening them to the public as museums was envisioned."
16422,freedom,"soon, however, i would realize that compared to what was to come after 2004, this period, though itself cynical, was, relatively speaking, a semi-spring of freedom."
16423,tortured,all i could hear was the howling of my many tortured friends amid the cacophony of laughter and threats of interrogators of both regimes.
16424,where,"i whispered, “let’s go.” we almost ran out of this hellish place where each of us had been an inhabiâ� tant, i under the shah’s regime and she under the islamic republic of iran."
16425,police,"as we left the museum of information, i thought of the double connotation of the term ettela‘at, which means both “information obtained, upheld, and revealed by the secret police,” and “information as knowledge whose purpose is to raise consciousness.” we passed the museum of coins nearby."
16426,power,"i thought of the contaminating power of violence and money, of the way they both often spoil whoever or whatever comes their way."
16427,power,i hence write today for the sake of all those friends—whom i either knew personally or my soul knew of their spirit of resistance and desire for justice—whose refusal to submit to the power of money and violence cost their lives.
16428,justice,it is in the spirit and for the sake of these always present friends—ghosts of justice and freedom—that i live.
16429,imprisonment,"1  in the footsteps of the giants  when i was arrested in 1977, i knew very little of the changes on the horizon that were soon to transform not only the iranian sociopolitical landscape but its penal system, and hence my own experiences of imprisonment."
16430,jail,i had just graduated from high school and entered university as a freshman when i found myself in jail.
16431,arrest,"yet, from my first day of school in â�tehran, in my tenth-grade year, when, shockingly, i heard my classmates making a mockery of the national anthem by twisting its words “may our king live forever” to “the donkey has tail and hoof” to that late evening of my arrest by three savak agents, the world had drastically changed around and in me."
16432,detention,"here i was, now, in the united anti-sabotage committee, perhaps the most notorious detention center for political prisoners in iran at the time, faced with the interrogators whose names i had heard on the underâ�ground radio, who had acquired their fame through demonstrations of the utmost brutality against many legendary dissidents."
16433,jails,"even with my insufficient knowledge of the savak and its jails, i was well aware of the fact that one did not need to be a serious threat to the regime to be severely tortured."
16434,imprisonment,my pursuit of banned books and dissident views was enough to subject me to torture and imprisonment.
16435,interrogation,"nonetheless, the fact that i had no connection to the guerrilla movement would have to be a factor in easing my interrogation process, at least in that particular historical moment."
16436,torture,"as his voyeuristic gaze violently examined my entire body, nearly undressing me with his lustful eyes—in my mind, even with his widely grinning teeth—and as he moved from advising “this young, pretty, and smart girl to save herself” from the torment of torture to slapping, hitting with his fists, and kicking, i awaited and imagined myself under the “real torture” with which he was threatening me."
16437,infamous,"the metaphorical marriage of sex and violence found a real face when hosseini, the most infamous torturer in the united anti-sabotage committee, sat quietly as an emblem of sheer animalistic violence, while others put on a show of competition of the most penetrating gaze on my body and the dirtiest assaults on my character."
16438,inside,"i clenched inside as they apparently enjoyed this visual feast, with remarks like, “she looks as sweet as her first name,” alluding to the name shirin, which means “sweet,” which the friend who had reported me to savak used to call me; or “she is as edible as her last name,” referring to my last name, talebi, which means “melon.” rasouli kept repeating the words talebi-e shirin, or “sweet melon,” while blinking with a dirty look in his eyes."
16439,torture,"i, however, tried to concentrate on what i assumed to be awaiting me, the real torture."
16440,torture,would i be able to withstand the severe torture that i conjured to be imminent?
16441,poverty,"i kept telling myself, again and again, that i needed to remember the poverty, discrimination, and all the injustices i had  in the footsteps of the giants  15  witnessed around me so the pain could not break me."
16442,justice,"that my devotion to justice should help me to stay firm, for no matter how excruciating my pain, it could never be as everlasting as that of the dispossessed people who live with constant humiliation and die gradually, i assured myself."
16443,justice,was i going to be able to prove my love and commitment to the people and to my ideal of justice?
16444,torture,"as fearful as i was of the menace of torture with which they were threatening me, i felt even more terrified of feeling so belittled."
16445,torture,"i therefore kept telling myself that, if put under real torture, i had to show them that i was more than a “little pretty girl,” as they kept calling me."
16446,confinement,"i was, nevertheless, sent to solitary confinement, without being subjected to that real torture."
16447,torture,"for the next four days, i waited, restlessly, for a call to interrogation and torture, nearly disappointed that i was not and horrified that i would be."
16448,cell,"i read and touched the writings on the walls of my cell, one of them written by the poet whose poetry i loved, as if hoping that through my touch their magical power would penetrate my body and soul, and i would become immune to the desires and weaknesses of my own flesh."
16449,inmates,but only a few days later the guards took me to the upper floor and put me in a room with five other inmates.
16450,jail,it was here that i began to see the rapid changes in that jail.
16451,prisoners,"they painted the rooms, cleaned the hallways, fixed the toilets and bathrooms, gave us spoons for eating, and treated prisoners less harshly."
16452,jail,"but once again, neither i nor the others in jail knew yet of the transforming power dynamics that were forcing the regime to change its penal policies."
16453,inmates,"thus, when only six days after my arrest, azodi, one of the highestranking savak officials, came into the room and i remained sitting while other inmates stood up as an indication of their respect for him, as was the unwritten rule, i expected to be sent directly to the torture room."
16454,cell,i recalled the story i had heard on the underground radio a couple of years earlier of a man who had refused to stand up during one of azodi’s visits to his cell and was subjected to severe torture.
16455,sentenced,"even when on the day of my trial, i resisted the government-assigned lawyer’s advice to “beg forgiveness from the shah and the judge,” i believed his threat about the possibility of being sentenced to death."
16456,sentence,"but i received a two-year sentence, which made me feel somewhat embarrassed, for i knew that the stance i took in the court could have easily resulted in a much harsher sentence had i been arrested a few months earlier."
16457,sentence,"little did i know that even before my twoyear sentence was completed, i would be among those prisoners the shah was forced to free under the pressure of the revolutionary movement."
16458,power,some politicians among his western allies began to see his new policies as a threat to the balance of power in the region and to their own dominance.
16459,suppression,"thus, when jimmy carter became president of the united states, he  in the footsteps of the giants  17  put pressure on the shah to alleviate political suppression, reduce censorship, and improve prison conditions."
16460,detention,"these changes reconfigured the landscape of iranian society, as well as its detention centers and prisons."
16461,prisoners,"initially, the regime pressed prisoners to sign letters of pardon to the shah requesting their release."
16462,freed,those who did so were freed in november 1977.
16463,jailed,many others refused to ask for a pardon and remained jailed.
16464,prisoners,"but by november 1978, people had turned into roaring rivers, demonstrating on the street and chanting for the freedom of political prisoners and making other demands."
16465,prisoners,these increasingly growing mass demonstrations compelled the shah to order the unconditional release of the majority of prisoners.
16466,sentence,"about four months before my sentence was over, my name appeared along with 999 other prisoners for release."
16467,jail,"even though the period of my stay in jail was less than two years, the outside world had radically changed between the time of my arrest and release."
16468,prisoners,"the government hoped that by freeing these prisoners, it could prevent the movement from becoming more radicalized."
16469,prisoners,"people who awaited us in front of the jails were moving to the next stage, demanding not only the freedom of all political prisoners but also the collapse of the entire regime."
16470,jail,"the lonely shoulders unlike my release in 1978, my departure from jail in 1991 under the islamâ� ic republic was not instigated by the power of a revolutionary movement."
16471,jail,there were no people waiting outside the jail this time to carry prisoners on their shoulders or take them to the demonstration.
16472,imprisonment,"in 1978, i had to change my prison uniform to the only other piece of clothing i had, a wornout tunic, to avoid being raised on people’s shoulders, for i did not see my “trivial” imprisonment worthy of such attention."
16473,prisoners,"although my release in late 1991 was also an attempt by the regime to resolve the problem of political prisoners, the plan to free prisoners in the 1990s was dependent on accepting the regime’s condition of release, which required signing a printed form known as enzejar nameh, a letter of repugnance or â�repudiation, or at  18  in the footsteps of the giants  least a mild version of it, which indicated the person denounced all dissident organizations and promised to avoid having any relationship with any kind of dissidence."
16474,jail,"those of us who did not accept this condition were set free only on a temporary basis, even though we were not asked to return to jail when the period of our temporary release was up."
16475,sentence,"our sentence was, however, pending in case the government decided to enforce it."
16476,prisoners,the fact that the release of prisoners in the1990s was not initiated by a revolutionary movement did not mean that there was no pressure both within and outside iran to urge the government toward this decision.
16477,prisoners,"rather, it implied that, as in 1977, in the early 1990s the state was confident enough to negotiate its power over prisoners and press them to accept the condition of release."
16478,freed,"those who remained fierce in refusing to submit were not freed, at least not officially."
16479,jail,"yet my release in 1978, which seemed such a radical freedom, was abruptly ended by my arrest and return to jail under the new regime."
16480,execution,"this time, however, i would be married to hamid, whom i would lose to execution."
16481,freedom,"ironically, the temporary nature of this freedom would allow me, and others in similar circumstances, to leave the country more easily, for since we had not been legally released, our names were not in the computer system as people who were prohibited from traveling abroad, at least, so the interrogators told my father after my departure from iran in late 1993."
16482,prisoners,"but those prisoners who had given in to the condition of release and had signed papers had to report to the regime on a regular, first weekly, then biweekly, and finally monthly, basis."
16483,freed,"they were not allowed to leave the country; strangely, therefore, those of us who had not been officially released were able to leave the country legally, while many of those who had been legally freed had to take the risk of being smuggled out."
16484,sentence,"yet our unofficial release remained precarious, for we could easily be forced to serve the remainder of our sentence if we were ever arrested again; this does not mean that others could not be rearrested but that our freedom felt even more fragile."
16485,imprisonment,his fear of the possibility of my rearrest and imprisonment was so grave for him that he preferred for us to live apart so i could be free and safe.
16486,arrested,"my freedom felt so shaky that when i was deciding to visit iran in 2002, for the first time since having left in late 1993, i not only had to deal with my friends’ opposition to the idea—in fact, one of my dissertation advisers believed that i was returning to iran because of my urge for a “heroic act”—but to hide it from my parents until i knew i was able to leave the airport rather than be arrested on the spot."
16487,arrest,"to protect my parents from worrying about the possibility of my arrest, and the heartache in case i was arrested, i had told only one of my sisters about the date of my arrival and asked her not to tell anyone until i had safely exited the airport gate."
16488,freedom,the temporary basis of this release also made it hard to feel a real sense of freedom.
16489,torture,"i dreamed of torture when i felt pressured even by the deadlines i set for myself while writing my doctoral dissertation, which led to my unconscious resistance to meeting them."
16490,prisoners,"i remained highly sensitive to issues that had to do with prisoners’ sufferings, wherever or whoever they were."
16491,inmates,the image of this suffocating little bird conflated with the images of my fellow inmates and became a recurring theme of my nightmares for years.
16492,freedom,"but in 1978, our freedom involved no conditions or formalities; we were not asked to sign any papers but were simply told to get ready and leave."
16493,prisoners,they argued that the regime might be trying to trick us into leaving so they could shoot us on the pretext that we were trying to escape—this they claimed had been done in chile to a group of prisoners.
16494,prisoners,â�others insisted that we should refuse to leave until the regime accepted the release of all political prisoners—a small number of prisoners were not freed â�because they were considered more serious threats to the regime.
16495,freedom,still  20  in the footsteps of the giants  others believed that we should immediately leave prison and join the fight for our friends’ freedom along with other revolutionary demands.
16496,prisoners,"that entire evening, we continued discussing our options among ourselves—should we immediately leave, refuse to leave until everyone is set free, or choose another option—while the officials came in and out, baffled as to why we were not running out now that the regime was letting us leave without any conditions for release of the sort that kept so many prisoners jailed, sometimes for years after their time was over."
16497,inmates,"a couple of other inmates and i were assigned to remember and communicate to the people outside, upon our release, the names of those prisoners who were still jailed."
16498,ward,"we were led toward the gate behind the ward, through the meeting hall, through the gate from which the families used to come in to the meeting hall to visit us."
16499,prisoners,"it was barely past nine in the morning when the gate was opened and about a hundred women prisoners were ushered through the gate to the outside, to the bosom of a crowd of strangers who acted like members of a single family."
16500,prisoner,"even though i was not in prison uniform, i am not sure if it was my worn-out tunic or the simultaneous excitement and confusion in my eyes that exposed my status as a former political prisoner."
16501,imprisonment,"although the risk of violent death in a demonstration was looming over any participant’s head, torture and long-term imprisonment were becoming issues of the past."
16502,prisons,"since 1977, under pressure from president jimmy carter, the regime had allowed the red cross to inspect its political prisons."
16503,prisoners,"in response to the rapidly growing protests, the regime had been forced to free the majority of its political prisoners."
16504,prisoners,the release of these prisoners was a defining moment in signaling the regime’s defeat and the subsequent giving in to people’s demands—a failed attempt in curtailing the protests.
16505,jail,i did not consider it unusual to leave their tearful eyes behind and ride with a group of strangers directly from jail to my first demonstration against the regime.
16506,arrested,"how acute my parents’ sorrow must have been, considering that i, a young woman, was the first member of my family arrested under the shah."
16507,imprisonment,"my imprisonment had doubly terrified them because of the rumors about the commonality of rape, especially of young women, by the interrogators—a rumor that was circulated by the populace as much as by the regime."
16508,arrest,"during the nearly two years that i was in prison, my parents hid my arrest even from the closest members of the family, especially those on my father’s side."
16509,rape,"they were worried that, considering the religio-cultural and class background of these relatives, the stigma of my possible rape—which did not happen—would be too overwhelming for my family to bear."
16510,seclusion,"for about two years, they thus essentially withdrew from their families, endured the pain of separation and their relentless fear, and cried silently in seclusion."
16511,jail,"they, however, did anything and everything humanly possible to get me out of jail—bore humiliation, withstood beatings, and finally eagerly joined the fight against the regime to release its political prisoners."
16512,jail,"so eager was i to be part of the movement that i did not even have time to acknowledge their exhaustion from having spent an entire sleepless night, during which they did not know if we would ever emerge from jail—for we, the women prisoners, whose names were in newspapers as those to be released, had refused to leave that very night."
16513,inmates,this refusal was meant to at once emphasize our demand for the release of all inmates and deny the regime a chance to send us out in the darkness of night—its tactic to prevent families from another gathering since every gathering was a chance for people to cry out their demand for the freedom of all political prisoners.
16514,prisoners,"these remaining prisoners were freed in the next few months, the last ones by the people on the day of victory of the 1979 revolution."
16515,question,"only a couple of minutes after sitting in the car, he asked me if i would like to hear a joke and immediately posed another question, which was a way of initiating the joke."
16516,jail,"on that day of my release in 1978, i did not even wait long enough to find my siblings among the jammed crowd in front of the jail."
16517,jail,"she had come to find me in the demonstration, after not seeing me in front of the jail."
16518,executed,"she was the first one of my siblings whom i saw and held once again upon my release in 1991, though this time not in a revolutionary march but on the way to visit a cemetery of executed dissidents where my husband and many of my friends lay."
16519,prisons,little did i know in 1978 how short lived my  24  in the footsteps of the giants  seemingly permanent freedom would be and how soon those very prisons would be holding ten times as many people.
16520,arrest,"at my second arrest, i was no longer single; hence all my worries were at least doubled to also include my husband, hamid, and his family."
16521,torture,"this time hard-core torture would not be a mere threat but a reality that i would have to endure both on my own body and as witness to others’ subjection to it, including my own hamid."
16522,sentence,"not to just two years, but to fifteen years would i be sentenced, and even that sentence i would owe, once again, to the end of a particularly harsh era and the beginning of a relatively less aggressive set of penal policies."
16523,jail,this time i would spend more than eight years in jail and meet and live not with about a hundred women but with more than a thousand.
16524,power,"when i was released in 1978, i could hardly even imagine the rapid wave of political suppression that would sweep so many lives away under a new regime that had risen to power on our own shoulders—i, and in fact many others, did anticipate it, but no one could have imagined its scale and severity."
16525,jail,"in 1991, when i was asked to sign a paper for a ten-day temporary release, which i refused to do and was nevertheless thrown out of jail, no serious popular movement against the regime appeared in sight."
16526,prisoners,"unlike in 1978, the release of nearly all political prisoners by 1992 was to signal the islamic republic regime’s confidence in having crushed its opponents and silenced the people."
16527,power,"beca u se the new regime  came to power by way of a revolutionary  movement, as in most such states, new arrests began immediately after the victory of the 1979 revolution."
16528,execution,"aside from the selective execution of the shah’s officials that took place only days after the revolution, from 1981 until 1988, massive arrests and summary executions became familiar features of the new regime."
16529,jail,"in the footsteps of the giants  25  the massacre of political prisoners in the summer of 1988 marked a turning point in the history of political suppression in iran: about five thousand prisoners were executed in the course of two months, and a majority of these prisoners had already been sentenced to jail time or were about to be released."
16530,war,the massacre occurred immediately after the announcement of the cease-fire in the iran-iraq war.
16531,prisoners,"the iranian state, in turn, used the attack as an opportunity to resolve its age-old problem of political prisoners by summarily killing thousands of individuals, none of whom were responsible for the attack."
16532,prisoners,"the “era of reconstruction” was announced by president ali akbar hashemi â�rafsanjani, whose great hope to attract foreign investments faced the obstacle of the iranian regime’s human rights abuses, at the center of which was the question of political prisoners."
16533,jailed,"now with the massacre of most jailed dissidents, the regime considered the potential threat to its future stability eliminated, at least for the most part."
16534,prisoners,"the release of the rest of the prisoners became the regime’s mission, which it undertook to accomplish with a spirit of confidence and necessity."
16535,torture,"the regime’s confidence hinged upon the assumption that, by killing so many dissidents and pushing the remainder of them into a state of despair through torture, the movement was beheaded."
16536,war,the flip side of this â�confidence was the pressure and an urgent need to create a new socioâ�political environment in the aftermath of the iran-iraq war.
16537,war,"to implement hashemi rafsanjani’s sociopolitical and economic plans toward â�reconstructing the country  26  in the footsteps of the giants  after the war, it seemed imperative to attract foreign investments, hence to initiate a new relationship with the outside world, especially with the west."
16538,prisoners,"releasing prisoners was one of the most important steps that the regime had to take, albeit in an excruciatingly complex and violent process that was to avoid the fate of the shah’s regime."
16539,prisoners,"the release of prisoners thus became the goal that the state pursued at nearly all costs, except that it was to appear not as an act of a defeated regime, like that of the shah, but as a gesture of strength and stability by a state that no longer felt threatened by its opponents."
16540,prisons,"in fact, the regime preferred the more colorful story in which its prisons had turned all its opponents to its supporters."
16541,prisoners,"as the shah did in 1977, the islamic republic regime began by forcing prisoners to submit to the condition of their release, which required their renunciation of their past and any political and ideological inclinations and affiliations that diverged from those of the official discourse of the state."
16542,prisoners,the denouncing of their past and the recanting of beliefs had been the condition for prisoners’ release since the early 1980s.
16543,prisoners,"an uneven battle, which had been going on between the prison officials and prisoners from the very early days of the islamic republic, was intensified, not in the quality of the recantation or renunciation but in its concentrated reinforcement of acquiring prisoners’ submission and therefore their release."
16544,prisoners,"from the early 1980s to 1990s, the state-mandated denunciation of their past as the condition for prisoners’ release saw many changes, but the basic demand for renunciation remained until nearly the end, when the regime had to give in and free prisoners, though officially on a temporary basis."
16545,prisoners,"this recantation-confession had to be made  in the footsteps of the giants  27  publiclyâ�—if not televised and broadcast on national television or on closed-circuit prison television, then at least carried out among a large crowd of prisoners in the huge prison halls, husseiniyeh."
16546,prisoners,"but from 1985 on, after the severe crackdown on the main dissident organizations of the â�early 1980s and prisoners’ resistance, the condition of release became less daunting—signing a letter of repugnance."
16547,prisoners,"f o ll o wing the massacre  of the summer of 1988, the regime underâ�  took the project of releasing prisoners by two means: pressure and negotiation."
16548,imprisonment,"first, the regime was aware that for many resistant prisoners, requesting a temporary release was meant to legitimize their imprisonment based on their dissident views, which the officials considered illegitimate."
16549,freed,"second, it counted on the fact that, while out, under the pressure of their families and friends and their own desire for freedom, they might sign the paper to be freed permanently."
16550,prisoners,"aside from all the pressure, what was unbearable for these prisoners was the fact that upon their refusal to sign the form, it was the responsibility of their families to deliver them to prison."
16551,prisoners,the stories of the suffering of these prisoners and their families in this often long process leading to prisoners’ release are abundant.
16552,jail,"in 1990, the guards brought soosan to my cell from the hospital where her mother lay in critical condition following a heart attack, apparently induced by anxiety because soosan’s one-week temporary release had ended but she refused to sign the paper and was to return to jail."
16553,sentence,"soosan was one of the prisoners who had remained imprisoned beyond their sentence terms; in fact, her one-year sentence had ended in 1982, but because she refused to submit to the condition of her release, she was still in jail."
16554,cell,"only two hours after soosan returned to her cell, the guards informed her that her mother had passed away."
16555,guilty,she did not have to hear the harsh words of the guards about how she was a murderer and killed her own mother to feel guilty.
16556,guilt,her guilt was already too overwhelming.
16557,death,"instead, in response to her request to attend the funeral, they bombarded her with more blame, accusing her of being selfish and the cause of her mother’s death."
16558,prisoners,"in regard to those prisoners who rejected requesting temporary release, the regime turned to their families to convince them to press their children to comply."
16559,torture,a few of these families were so eager to see their children released that they even seemed not to mind their subjection to torture if it forced them to submit to the regime’s condition.
16560,torture,"while it pained them to see their loved ones subjected to torture, for some of these families the desire for the release and the saving of their loved ones was a higher priority."
16561,tortured,sima was one of these women whom the regime brought to a face-to-face visit with her parents after she had been severely tortured.
16562,torture,she could not take the torture of the interrogators and the pressure from her family.
16563,prisoners,"by 1990, a large number of prisoners had signed the papers and were freed."
16564,cell,"thus, when that morning in november 1991, the guard opened the door of my cell and called my name “for the hospital,” so she claimed, i left the cell unaware that this was to be my day to leave prison."
16565,confinement,we had been taken to solitary confinement after most of our friends had gone through many rounds of being in and out of prison.
16566,cell,"while at first we were in solitary confinement, later two of us shared a cell; we felt lonelier with every friend who was released."
16567,jail,the guards made every effort to render our daily life in jail as unbearable as possible.
16568,jail,"what made these experiences so hard to take was the empty space left in jail, first by the massacre of 1988 and now by the release of our friends, which obviously should have brought us joy."
16569,cellmate,"the night before, my cellmate and i had discussed the possibility of who would be the next to leave, and she, being from a provincial town with a family of much more modest means than even mine, argued that it could not be her."
16570,bail,"i told her that my father would never go against my wishes to request my release and that even if he decided to do so, he did not have the means to provide the regime with the huge bail that was required for my release."
16571,bail,the bail had to be posted whether the release was temporary or permanent.
16572,sentence,"30  in the footsteps of the giants  but now i was out, again before my sentence was completed and supposedly only for ten days."
16573,jailed,"after both releases, my heart remained with the small group who were still jailed."
16574,prisoners,"but at this point, the issue about the release of prisoners, at least the leftists, was mainly the question of who could afford to bail them out."
16575,cellmate,"my cellmate came out about a year later, for her family could not afford to bail her out."
16576,case,"in my case, a relative had agreed to offer his house."
16577,where,"unwilling to disagree with me, they nervously told me that we had to go to my oldest sister’s house, where we could wait for my youngest brother to come and drive us to the cemetery, which they explained was too far away for us to go on our own."
16578,jail,"although frustrated, deep down i felt more comfortable, for i could go to the cemetery still feeling more like an inhabitant of jail than of this other world."
16579,jail,"fresh from jail, i had to promise them that i was not going to let them die in silence, that i would never forget them."
16580,freedom,"after all, hadn’t i longed for this freedom and for being with my family again?"
16581,war,"he thus had to register as a conscript for two and a half years of military service, which coincided with one of the worst periods of the iran-iraq war, from 1985 to 1988—the conscription service had been increased from two to two and a half years during the war."
16582,war,"ironically therefore, while i was living the nightmarish days and nights of that hellish summer in 1988, he was caught between two sides of a war, between the iranian regime and the mojahedin who had attacked iran."
16583,war,"a pacifist at heart, he had lived the entire war, first between iran and iraq and now between iran and an iranian militant organization, under an impossible situation, trying not to kill and not to be killed."
16584,term,it was nearly the end of my conscription term.
16585,war,"i thought i had survived this war without killing, without becoming a murderer."
16586,war,a few of my friends and i who had nothing to do with this war found ourselves under the fire and the eyes of both sides.
16587,killing,"ahead of us were mojahedin whom we were trying to avoid killing, while at the same time we were trying to avoid being killed by them."
16588,war,"it was as if we each were looking for the traces of significant moments of iranian recent history, revolution, war, and political violence on the other’s face and body, imagining their carvings on each other’s soul."
16589,gate,"it was already late afternoon when, after a long drive through the crowded streets and highways of tehran, all the way from the northwestern part to the southeast, finally my brother branched off the main road and drove the short distance of a dirt alley before stopping in front of the metal gate of the cemetery."
16590,wall,"right across the entrance, beyond the wall that enclosed the cemetery, a small window in a church tower stood tall with a view of almost the entirety of this otherwise godforsaken landscape."
16591,crimes,i tried to imagine the crimes it must have witnessed.
16592,prisoners,it was during this summer that my hamid and about five thousand other prisoners were executed.
16593,prisoners,"the journalists did not perhaps stay long enough to see how night after night during those two months, meat trucks carried the bodies of hundreds of political prisoners and hastily dumped them into the ditches that were clumsily dug in the dark of night."
16594,where,"some mothers uncovered these mass graves with their bare hands to find some solace in learning the precise spot where their children were buried, only to come back and see the entire place turned upside down by bulldozers."
16595,crime,"zohreh, a woman whose three brothers were executed, two of  34  in the footsteps of the giants  them in the early 1980s and the third one in 1988, related this to me: “the red ants would have revealed the secret of this crime anyway, even without the dogs dragging out the arms and legs of our loved ones, even if we had not heard about the german journalists or had not been able to talk to some of these afghani workers."
16596,jail,"after months of no news, their worst nightmares came true when, instead of a visit with their loved ones in jail, they came face-to-face with the shocking proof of their death in their traumatic encounter with the uncovered arms, legs, or faces of the young dead men, who had been buried with their clothes on."
16597,inside,"i tried so hard to keep my tears hidden inside, hidden from my parents and everyone else, as hamid’s body had been kept hidden from me."
16598,wall,"the cemetery was surrounded by a brick wall, within which a rectangular-shaped area was nearly divided in half, though not by any wall or fence but by the distinctive landscapes on each side."
16599,executed,a few bumps on the ground and some broken stones here and there told the story of different periods of brutality but also the story of the struggle of those families whose loved ones were executed in the early 1980s to make the deaths of their loved ones visible.
16600,state,it also reflected the intolerance of the state toward allowing these dead dissidents a place not so much to rest but to remain visible and be recognized as dead.
16601,wall,"the area closer to the wall of the christian cemetery and its church was, however, completely flat with no indication of the lives that were cut short and buried under its soil."
16602,state,"baha’is were allowed to mark the graves of their dead and even plant flowers and bushes, but they could not create the kind of lasting greenery that one could see, for instance, in behesht zahra, the muslims’ main cemetery in tehran, especially in its flower garden of the martyrs, a section allocated to those whose death the state considered as martyrdom."
16603,executed,"the area closer to the gate held the bodies of those executed in the early 1980s, where the families were at least given a sense of where their loved ones were buried with a single grave for each individual—since the bodies were not given to the families and they could not be present at the process of burial, there were many occasions when two or more families were given the same location for the grave of their dead."
16604,where,"in this remote area of tehran, where one could see no houses, where no one walked around, the dead, my dead loved ones, seemed really lost, utterly deserted."
16605,death,"this was not a mere cemetery but the cemetery of a cemetery, where the dead person was lost to his or her own death."
16606,death,"i felt like i was losing them not simply because of their death but because their death was a forced erasure from the face of this land, from the face of life, and from history."
16607,inside,but now he knew that i must be crying inside.
16608,guilt,"i could not ignore my guilt, noticing my father’s anxious behavior, his even more than usual hasty walk, and the raspy sound of his sick lungs."
16609,where,i thus turned to my father and asked where hamid and my friends were buried.
16610,jail,"later, when i learned that the section to which my father had taken me belonged to the baha’i dead, i was surprised that i had not even come across the names of those baha’is whom i knew were executed in jail—apparently my father had intentionally misled me, in his mind to protect me from the pain of my first experience in the outside world in seeing a barren land as the graveyard of my love."
16611,arrested,"soon, i would find out that the families avoid coming as small groups or come during different hours to reduce the risk of being attacked or arrested by the government."
16612,guilt,"no way could i find hamid or any of my other friends while overwhelmed with so much guilt; neither could i talk to them, not while my father was anxiously walking around and eyeing my every gesture; not when my heart was pierced by my mother’s innocent tears."
16613,arrest,"we drove to my parents’ house—a house i had not seen before, for after my arrest, they had been forced to sell their house in tehran overnight and move to karadj, a town about forty-five miles west of tehran."
16614,arrest,i had worked and lived on my own even before my first arrest under the shah.
16615,where,"as we drove away from the cemetery, i felt my heart was buried there, but not in a particular spot where i could go and look for it."
16616,prisoner,"the difference between me, the former political prisoner, and the outside world made more sense to me when a few months later, in the midst of the deafening noise of several different languages and dialects, compressed in the minibus, in the mixture of the sweaty odor of bodies and the smell of gasoline, i saw two eager eyes inviting recognition."
16617,inmate,"she was even paler than soudabeh ardavan, a former inmate, had portrayed her in her prison drawings."
16618,punishment,"pori was one of those women taken to a severe punishment ward set up by haji davoud, the chief of ghezel hesar prison at the time."
16619,punishment,"this already notorious prison, located in karadj, was bestowed with a new dimension of infamy because of this punishment ward, which haji â�davoud referred to as kārkhāneh-ye-ādam sāzi, the human-making factory, or dastgah-e-ādam sāzi, the human-making machine—prisoners shortened it and simply referred to it as dastgah."
16620,ward,"the landscape of this human-making factory was a large hall in vahed-e 1 ward, or unit 1, within which a large number of small cells were temporarily built by erecting makeshift wooden walls."
16621,cell,"each cell was separated from others either by the original walls of the hall or the makeshift wooden walls, depending on its location in the hall."
16622,prisoners,"the wooden walls were high enough to prevent prisoners from seeing each other while they were either sitting or lying down, which was their status all the time except for brief moments when they would be taken to the restroom, for a shower, or for interrogation."
16623,cell,"all prisoners faced the wall; again, depending on the location of their spot, they faced either the wall of the hall, if their cell was adjacent to any four walls of the hall, or the wooden wall."
16624,wall,"they were, however, entirely exposed to the guards, who could see and access them from above—these boxlike cells had no roofs and their walls were not high—and there was  40  in the footsteps of the giants  no wall behind them."
16625,wall,"thus, while they faced the wall, blindfolded even while asleep, they were under constant scrutiny by the guards, who could strike them at any moment."
16626,prisoners,"during the ten months that this torturous situation lasted, from 1983 to 1984, prisoners were forced to live, in their own words, in these j‘abehha (boxes), taboota (coffins), or ghabra (graves)."
16627,prisoners,"since the prisoners were blindfolded all the time, these blows, which so abruptly struck their bodies almost always unexpectedly, carved a huge hole in their minds within which the deadly bird of anticipation hovered, constantly flapping its wings."
16628,prisoners,"from six in the morning until ten at night, prisoners had to squat on the floor, motionless and silent."
16629,prisoners,"even the softest of the lashes by these former friends, who were now playing extra hands of evil, felt harsher on prisoners’ bodies; these lashes sank deeper into their memories and burned an irreducible, enduring register of pain in their minds and bodies."
16630,prisoners,"trust was shattered; it survived in an abstract language, which was already eluding prisoners."
16631,prisoners,"those who had gone through this calamitous situation, be it the collaborators or the resistant prisoners, were marked by its injuries, which they carried with them to the wards where they were returned, and perhaps later, everywhere they went."
16632,death,"the question remained, however, what kind of survival was this, since death had captured them before they could physically die?"
16633,torture,"they sent them under torture by false statements; they hated any sign of resistance, for they saw it as the negation of their presently precarious existence."
16634,prisoners,"but if these prisoners were still capable of functioning, albeit in a deadly and destructive manner, there were others who appeared so oblivious to their existence that even death could pass them by without noticing them or being noticed by them."
16635,prisoner,"although the corpse of a stagnant life was still  42  in the footsteps of the giants  clinging to its vegetative being like a parasite, the prisoner had already departed this world."
16636,torture,"they became the subject of a never-ceasing torture, humiliation, and pain, eternally reproduced in their own mind, a mind possessed by and frozen in a horrifyingly, ever-present past."
16637,state,"this was a state of being in which the self was frozen, either at the time before the horrific experience or at the moment of its occurrence, as if nothing existed before or from that moment on."
16638,prisoners,but a small number of prisoners came out of this human-making factory with their subjectivity still somewhat intact.
16639,inmates,"yet, while she refused to be broken by the regime, mistrust of her fellow inmates grew inside her."
16640,ward,she returned to the ward but soon withdrew from others and remained in a kind of isolation that resembled her condition in the dastgah.
16641,inmates,"it is true that some of them explained this desire for isolation as a way of distancing themselves from other inmates, who, they argued, were unable to recognize the consequences of their adventurous actions against the regime."
16642,inmates,"they recounted how some of the most outspoken inmates were broken in the dastgah even faster than others and how they turned into collaborators who reported, menacingly, on their former cellmates."
16643,inmates,"many prisoners perceived these withdrawn inmates as cynical, as political pessimists, if not just broken."
16644,prisoners,"those who had chosen to withdraw from others, in turn, construed other prisoners as politically naïve or irresponsible adventurers."
16645,prisoners,some of these prisoners would realize that they had superimposed their own experiences and emotions onto the views of their political affiliations only after they were released.
16646,jail,"but while in jail, as time went by, the distance between those who were isolated and the others grew deeper."
16647,prisoners,"the division increased, for gradually even those who had distanced themselves from the rest of the prisoners but were close to one another began to distance themselves from each other."
16648,inmates,"pori, one of these inmates who had been subjected to ten months of isolation in haji’s hell, was now living in her own self-imposed isolation."
16649,imprisonment,"despite her self-isolated, thus double, imprisonment, pori still refused to give in to the regime’s condition to sign the letter of repugnance for her release."
16650,jail,"all those years in jail, a short while after returning from the â�dastgah, she spent most of her days sitting silently as portrayed in soudabeh’s drawing, hidden behind newspapers and reading them meticulously, at least so it appeared."
16651,imprisonment,her words made me realize how strong the bond of pain was between those of us who had experienced those years of imprisonment and the challenges of surviving in the world so estranged  44  in the footsteps of the giants  from it.
16652,prisoners,"the “we” of which she was speaking was a reference to all of us former political prisoners, with whom she now seemed to feel a deeper connection than to her own family members."
16653,imprisonment,this was a kinship felt not only by pori but by nearly all of us who had survived imprisonment without becoming collaborators or without having completely lost ourselves in the process.
16654,inmates,"in regard to haji davoud’s human-making machine, both the experiences of those inmates who lived through it and the language with which they spoke of it varied from one person to another."
16655,prisoners,"male prisoners seemed to have chosen a single metaphor, taboota, to refer to the place within which they were forced to live for months."
16656,prisoners,"notwithstanding its initial coinage, it appeared to have resonated with nearly all prisoners, for after hearingâ€it from men, women often spoke of those cells either as ghabra or taboota."
16657,prisoners,"perhaps no other name could have conveyed as accurately what the place was to achieve, the annihilation of prisoners’ old selves."
16658,ward,"some women simply spoke of it as â�vahed-eâ€1, which alluded to the ward within which the wooden cells were erected."
16659,punishment,"others referred to it as gharantineh, or quarantine, also the name haji davoud and other prison officials used for the large hall in this ward  in the footsteps of the giants  45  where prisoners were often taken for different periods for further punishment."
16660,prisoners,"as the name suggests, the place was to temporarily segregateâ€the “contagiously dangerous” elements from the rest of the prisoners, as is theâ€purpose of quarantine in epidemics, until they were either cured or dead."
16661,punishment,"for instance, was the term taboota, which nowadays has been adopted more broadly by most former prisoners and even the larger public to allude to the presumably unisex experience of prisoners in those punishment wards, simply coined by men based on the physical resemblance between those wooden cells and coffins?"
16662,prisoners,yet this argument rests on two assumptions: on a stereotypical view of men as more practical minded than women and a reductive notion of death that does not take the complexities of prisoners’ experiences and views of life and death into account.
16663,prisoners,"but in a sense, haji davoud’s “human-making machine,” a term known by both male and female prisoners, was intended to produce his desirable humans through the destruction of prisoners’ old selves."
16664,ward,"even though haji could not break everyone and  46  in the footsteps of the giants  the ward was finally closed down, those who emerged were not the same as the ones who had gone in."
16665,prisoners,"for example, ascribing names like “coffins” or “graves” could implicitly articulate and reinforce prisoners’ sense of death as an inevitable “destiny-ation” of haji’s project."
16666,death,"death, however, does not mean only a physical ceasing of existence."
16667,inmates,death appeared differently in the language of men and women inmates.
16668,prisoners,"male prisoners used the word zadan, beating, to refer to execution."
16669,execution,why should execution be considered synonymous with beating?
16670,inmates,"isn’t it true that under torture, inmates had to give up the body on which the torturer exercised his power, in order to preserve their integrity?"
16671,inmates,"isn’t it the case that, to save their soul, inmates had to detach themselves from their body and let the body go?"
16672,execution,which one of these meanings of life and death did these men have in mind when they used zadan to mean execution?
16673,execution,"how should one interpret the fact that women distinguish between zadan and e‘edām, execution?"
16674,torture,"are these differences merely gendered languages, or did the experiences of torture differ for men and women?"
16675,ward,"although women do not use one name for the ward and the cells in it, almost every name has something to do with the official reference."
16676,prisoner,"for example, vahed-e 1 simply refers to the ward in which these wooden cells  in the footsteps of the giants  47  were set up; dastgah was haji’s word, only shortened, and takhta alluded to a small space nearly the size of a small single bed between the wooden walls where the prisoner could sleep."
16677,inmates,to refuse to name this place with a single term may indicate women inmates’ refusal to submit to a single possible outcome or destiny.
16678,torture,"the names could also be considered evidence of women’s naïveté, as their failure to understand the significance of this torture machine and the limitations of human capacity for tolerating pain."
16679,imprisonment,it was not rare to hear of the inadequacy of female inmates’ knowledge and experience of political activism and imprisonment.
16680,imprisonment,"of course, the number of men who had experienced imprisonment under both the shah and the islamic republic far exceeded that of women."
16681,term,"however, assuming, for instance, that women’s shortening haji’s term “human-making machine” to “machine” was an unimaginative act of mere abbreviation sounds rather odd to me."
16682,death,"words were not casually utilized in prison; particularly under the islamic republic, words could easily save someone or lead to someone’s death."
16683,question,this raises another question: to what extent does language speak us or we speak language?
16684,jail,"i also keep contemplating the manner in which such “otherly” worlds and words find their way to my present world, the way they get translated to a corresponding language in daily life outside jail."
16685,inmates,"this noise took me back to seven years earlier, when the bus in which i met pori came to a stop with such a sound, reminding me of the lash that stroked the air and fell on inmates’ bodies to rip their flesh off."
16686,cellmate,"i never saw her again, but i looked with those eyes when in europe i saw zinat, my former cellmate."
16687,where,"i lived that alienation when in the early years of coming to the united states, i went to parties where the conversation often revolved around beautiful dresses, good-looking “babes,” and fancy cars."
16688,torture,"but i felt that the real torture had not yet started, and i was impatiently and fearfully anticipating it."
16689,situation,"the whole day i thought, what was it that helped me survive that impossible situation?"
16690,state,"contemplating the state of my being, only then did i realize the selves that had died within me without my recognition."
16691,power,"i am talking about it, as others have, so i do not forget and yet to free myself from its haunting, imprisoning power."
16692,prisoners,"how might i avoid essentializing the particular experiences of political prisoners in a specific moment of â�iranian history yet also avoid reducing the experience to the act of crueltyâ€ofâ€an islamic state, as has often been done by the west and even many iranians?"
16693,state,"such writing often turns an intimate personal experience into a public matter, into objectified evidence, one more document, to prove the state’s atrocity."
16694,prisoners,"as i began  50  in the footsteps of the giants  thinking about writing, the ghostly presence of those prisoners who had gone mad became overwhelming."
16695,executed,"but i asked myself, if so, why not write about those who have been executed without having the chance to write their last will?"
16696,prisoners,the debate about the mass executions of 1988 has always been very rancorous among iranian political prisoners and activists.
16697,court,they argued over whether or not the prisoners knew that they were being taken for execution in the last moments of their lives and if having the knowledge would have made any difference in the way they answered the few questions in the court that determined their life or death.
16698,prisoners,"many of those male prisoners who had accepted the regime’s conditions, and therefore had escaped their “destiny,” attempted to convince others that the knowledge of imminent death would have changed the strategies of the condemned."
16699,prisoners,"on the other hand, the women who had lived and gone through long periods of torture in prison, both physically and psychologically, and survived the loss of their loved ones, insisted that their resistance and refusal to submit were not merely emotional, irrational, womanly behavior or a stubborn or sentimentally heroic gesture, as suggested by some male political prisoners and sometimes even their own families."
16700,situation,"it was rather, they argued, a necessary response to a situation in which their submission would turn them into vegetative beings."
16701,death,"in the footsteps of the giants  51  whatever the essence of these subjective debates, both sides based their arguments on the assumption that death and silence are inexorably correlated."
16702,prisoners,this assumption appeared perplexing when accepted by prisoners who had themselves so often experienced blurry boundaries.
16703,prisoners,"many political prisoners had faced interrogation and torture, wherein silence defined the essence of one’s existence."
16704,death,"death, on the other hand, sometimes cried out with an eloquence that opened up a far greater space of communication than physical existence could have."
16705,prisons,"prisons are to isolate the unfit, inappropriate, and nonconformist other from the rest of society."
16706,prisoners,"the interrogators’ relationships to the prisoners vary depending on the quality and level of the prisoners’ involvement in the opposition movement, their position in their organizations, resistance to torture, gender, class and ethnic identities, and even physical appearance."
16707,prisoners,prisoners draw many other boundaries that erect invisible walls between them within the prison walls.
16708,prisoners,executed prisoners belong to a terrain that we cannot enter unless we give up on our lives or perhaps our sanity.
16709,executed,"surviving almost always insinuates suspicion about the survivor’s compromised integrity—at least an assumption that if not executed, she or he did not pose a serious threat to the regime as a dissident."
16710,inmates,"the survivor herself usually lives with guilt even when she is aware that inmates’ lives and deaths were so often determined arbitrarily, sometimes simply based on gender, political and religious affiliation, or family background."
16711,death,"while the world of death shuts its door on the living, madness ruptures the soul as the body continues its existence."
16712,death,"madness touches death’s fiery fingertips, flies on its wings, and climbs up its doorstep but does not totally enter into its world."
16713,death,the dream of death fills the gap in a shattered world and the pieces through which a mad person travels.
16714,death,that is how madness and death come face-to-face at the crossroads of an unknown other world.
16715,death,yet sheer physical existence distinguishes death and mad-  52  in the footsteps of the giants  ness in a relatively radical manner.
16716,death,"we see the strange behavior and make judgments about it, but our knowledge of what is beyond death adds up to almost nothing."
16717,where,"i am on this side of the world where i can still be seen, be judged, and judge."
16718,death,"i have met death face-to-face but have not been allowed—luckily or unluckily?—to set foot in its mystified “garden.” the ominous thought of falling into the darkness of this endless well captivated me as i watched those who were so severely isolated from the rest of us, and the possibility of opening any space to speak from that well was dramatically diminished."
16719,death,neither my parents nor i was more horrified of death than of crossing the line into the strange world of madness.
16720,entrapment,"evading entrapment in the lives i was touching, sometimes perhaps briefly living within their world or visiting their threshold, i distanced myself from madness."
16721,imprisoned,"a year and half after she was released, two months after my departure, mahvash, a physician who was imprisoned for nine years, committed suicide."
16722,state,"it was a state of despair, a space of silence and lost voice."
16723,cell,roya was setting her table again in her little corner of the cell while barking and crawling in the hallway the next moment.
16724,death,"i was saving her from death but forcing her deeper into a continuous hellish agony, fright, and melancholy."
16725,death,"—stefania pandolfo, impasse of the angels when the man laughs, he already laughs with the laugh of death."
16726,prisoners,"the ward was so crowded that i thought she would be crushed under the feet of other prisoners, who i was not sure had seen this fragile body."
16727,prisoners,even her barking wasn’t heard since prisoners were talking to one another and the ward was filled with noise.
16728,punishment,"but my eyes were fixed on her as she crawled, barked, and begged sister bakhtiyari to allow her to stop barking and crawling—“sister” was the title by which prisoners were to refer to the women guards; all the male prison personnel, from guards to interrogators, were to be called “brother.” refusing to refer to the prison officials as sisters and brothers was itself another reason for punishment."
16729,notorious,"55  56  roya  roya was still barking and asking sister bakhtiyari, a notorious guard in gohar dasht prison, to let her stop."
16730,guard,"i wished i could make her understand that there was no guard there and no one was asking her to bark or crawl anymore, but i could not."
16731,torture,"if roya had actualized her anticipation of the torture so that there was no distinction between imaginary and real torment, for many of us the world of our nightmares had turned into the terrain where this perplexity played itself out."
16732,inmates,many inmates screamed while sleeping but kept themselves busy during the day and managed to act normally.
16733,torture,"torture and humiliation in prison are brutal hunters waiting for an opportunity to seize their prey; our nights could simply turn into reality the day after, sometimes in the same night."
16734,cell,"roya was still crying and promising sister bakhtiyari that she would be a “good girl” and never again would violate the rules, that she would not tap on the wall of her cell to talk to her neighbor in another cell."
16735,torture,"she was circling around, back and forth, side to side, in a desperate gesture of trying to escape the torture."
16736,taken,"e paradox of children, solemn savagery —yacine kateb, nedjma  i was six years old, i remembered: the dog was sadly wailing, running around with its eyes covered by the black scarf that the boys had forcefully taken from my head."
16737,prisoners,"under both the shah and the islamic republic, the torturers forced the prisoners to play different animals’ roles, especially dogs and donkeys."
16738,prisoner,one of the torturers’ hobbies was getting a ride from these prisoner-donkeys.
16739,inmates,"“roya was my student in high school: such a sweet and brilliant student she was,” aki, one of the inmates, told me, during one of those insane evenings when roya had once again crawled and begged not to be a dog for an hour or so."
16740,cell,"but now she had stopped crawling and was back in her cell, squatting in a corner with her arms tightly holding her knees."
16741,prisoners,"it was 1984 when seventy prisoners, i among them, were taken from evin prison in tehran to ghezel hesar in karadj."
16742,torture,"during the last few months, many of us were taken for interrogation and repeated torture."
16743,prisoners,"we had to listen to the confessions of prisoners, many of them our close friends."
16744,prisoners,these were prisoners who had gone through haji davoud’s dastgah and had agreed to collaborate with the interrogators.
16745,torture,the information that they produced pushed many of us back into the torture rooms.
16746,taken,"the rumor was that a place existed, dastgah, and that whoever was taken there came out broken, defeated, either crazy or a ruthless collaborator."
16747,where,"the prison officials threatened that they were taking us to jāei keh arab ney andākht, a place where a legendary arab had dropped his ney, a flutelike musical instrument."
16748,where,the expression was to warn us that where we were being taken  roya  59  was so deserted that we would be lost to outsiders as if we were a ney under the dust in the desert.
16749,evin,"after being transferred from evin to ghezel hesar, for three days we were kept in a big hall to be taken to that “nowhere.” during these days, we breathed the air of barzakh, sat so close to hell that it barely separated us from hell’s fire."
16750,torture,sometimes torture stops when you do not or cannot see any end to it.
16751,prisoner,"against this hope, interrogators try to create an atmosphere of the eternity of horror so that the prisoner loses sight of any possible ending."
16752,prisoner,"the joy of the end is, however, often tarnished by the terrifying question in the prisoner’s mind, what if the end had not come?"
16753,jail,"a woman who was in jail during the 1980s explains these precarious moments between her own state of despair and the end of torture: “half consciously, i thought if these interrogators were not such idiots, they would have known the state of mind of a prisoner in each moment."
16754,prisoners,"probably those prisoners who were whipping their own friends, or participating in their execution had been caught in the state that i was last night.” all of a sudden, our anticipation for the torments that were awaiting us in the dastgah came to an end, though our pondering of the “what if?” question continued."
16755,punishment,we were not taken to “nowhere” since the whole process stopped as a result of prisoners’ families’ pressure and the conflict within the regime over this system of punishment.
16756,ward,"instead, they took us to a ward that was already overpopulated."
16757,ward,entering that ward was one of my most grotesque experiences in prison.
16758,where,"as soon as the metallic door was opened and we were pushed in, we were squeezed into a small hall where we saw hundreds of women jammed behind the bars, like animals in their cages."
16759,evin,"the cells were also separated from the main hall by similar black metal bars, which made them appear more like cages than the rooms or cells in which i had lived in different wards in evin prison."
16760,prisoners,"while we were jammed in this zir-e hasht, where the warden’s office was located, waiting to be assigned our cells and to be added to the list of prisoners in this ward, women on the other side gathered behind bars; some even climbed the bars to watch us."
16761,taken,"at the time, we had no idea why we had not been taken to the dastgah."
16762,ward,neither did we know what was awaiting us in this new ward.
16763,where,"from where i was standing and eyeing the other side, the place awaiting us looked more like a madhouse."
16764,inside,"in a few days, however, i would forget this image since i would be immersed in it; i would be inside it, making my own noise."
16765,ward,"it took a long day, or at least so it felt under the eyes of so many people watching, to be sent into the ward."
16766,ward,"in the ward, there was no guard because the collaborators from the dastgah were doing the guards’ work for them."
16767,ward,"only rarely would a guard, male or female, depending on the situation, come to the ward or to the office."
16768,prisoners,"the head of the ward was a former leftist, homa kalhor, who used to be a close friend of one of our fellow prisoners."
16769,jail,"those prisoners who had been in jail longer than i had begun to recognize faces among the ones on the other side, some of whom had clearly become collaborators."
16770,ward,seeing homa kalhor as the head of the ward shocked our friend so much that she became very pale and began to vomit.
16771,prisoners,"melancholic evenings and madness it was in this bizarre place that i saw roya for the first time, on one of those evenings when the prisoners were pouring out of their cells like lava from a volcano."
16772,interrogation,"these flights are extremely terrifying, especially during the interrogation period."
16773,prisoners,these were concerns that deprived prisoners of sleep.
16774,prisoners,the trauma of evening extends beyond prison so that it affects prisoners’ feelings about this time of the day for years to come.
16775,ward,"on such an evening i saw roya in ward 7 in ghezel hesar, where we had been taken after waiting three days to be sent to haji’s dastgah."
16776,arrested,she was arrested before she was eighteen.
16777,notorious,"all we knew was that she was kept in solitude, in the notorious gohar dasht prison, for a long time."
16778,tortured,"roya  63  obviously, she had been severely tortured."
16779,punishment,"we knew she had been put in a cell without any light for several nights, a common punishment in gohar dasht, from which she had come out mad."
16780,torture,"e almost as obsessively narrow and repetitive as the pain on which it models itself, torture can be more easily seen because it has dimension and depth, a space that can be walked around in though not walked out of."
16781,cell,"—elaine scarry, the body in pain  and i remembered: the interrogator opened a small metallic door and pushed me into a small cell."
16782,sentence,"i had just begun to say that i had already told them who i was, but before my sentence was finished, i was on the floor vomiting."
16783,inside,something burned inside me.
16784,hole,"it felt as if a monster had opened its mouth in my abdomen, a huge hole that swallowed all the evils of the world that induce pain and devastation."
16785,inside,"his boot was still on my chador, and i vaguely remembered his fast, severe kick that felt so deep inside me."
16786,prisoners,"e  64  roya  prisoners’ desperate and vain attempts to move to the corners to avoid beatings are reinforced and taken advantage of by the torturers who surround and trap them, as hunters catch their prey."
16787,cell,"that roya often retreated to the corner of her cell, from the agony of her memory of torture, which for her was not a memory but a living reality her mind perpetuated, reenacted this scene of hunting."
16788,cell,"her retreat to the corner of her cell was a walking into, rather than out of, torture."
16789,torture,"she lived her torture in a span of time that stretched and tied her past experiences to the present moment, in such a way that it was neither past nor present."
16790,prisoners,"the stark contrast between our modern perceptions, which rely so heavily on precision, clear distinctions, and dichotomies, and the world of delirium in which the boundaries and borders are blurred, is further accentuated in prisoners’ remembrance of their traumatic experiences in which memory and reality are fused."
16791,punishment,"in roya’s reliving sister bakhtiyari’s punishment, the past appeared in the present, and the present became the past; places, gohar dasht (meadow of jewel) and ghezel hesar (golden fence), were mixed up."
16792,state,"the only moment relived out of this hideous all-present past was the state of suspense in which roya awaited the dreadful return of sister bakhtiyari to once again force her to bark and crawl like a dog, all playing out in her mind."
16793,torture,"what kinds of emotions did this forced behavior invoke in roya that it stayed with her even more colorful, vivid, and present than the torture that had forced her to submit to these humiliating acts?"
16794,tortured,"it was this space of suspension, this barzakh, where the blaze of the past still burned the injured body of the tortured person, where the flame of the upcoming hell scorched the mind before it reached the body in which we lived from one evening to another."
16795,prisoner,it was this uncertainty with which a prisoner had to come to terms and live.
16796,imprisoned,"failing to do so could result in being imprisoned in the torturous moment, in one’s inability to move out of it, which would mean to lose the capacity to create and live with history, memory, and imagination."
16797,imprisoned,"a frozen present, like that in which roya was imprisoned, blocks the possibility of imagination and precludes the possibility of differentiating between reality and illusion."
16798,torture,torture generates an impasse.
16799,state,"the extensive pain inflicted on a person’s body and soul throws one into a state of vacillation and confusion, between memory and experience, that tarnishes the person’s ability to separate the frontiers of imagining and seeing."
16800,torture,"under torture, time seems unimpeded, an eternity; there is no memory before or after that."
16801,prisoner,"of this destruction of all distinctions in the face of the pain of torture, a former iranian woman prisoner, also in the 1980s, remembers: “counting, cursing, or imagining my loved ones’ faces no longer had any effect in reducing the pain of the lashes."
16802,where,i could no longer even tell where on my body the lashes were hitting.
16803,torture,"each blow was running through my whole body as an electrical shock, a sharp pain all over my body.” under torture, even death with its grinning smile—how often it is longed for!— does not exist for the person for whom life no longer offers anything but pain and suffering."
16804,torture,this impairment in perception clouds the space between anticipation of torture and its real occurrence.
16805,cell,there was not enough space for all of us to be in a cell at the same time.
16806,cell,"once in a while when nobody else was in her cell, roya would prepare for her imaginary guests."
16807,cell,"day after day, i sat in the corner of my cell and watched her through the bars, fascinated by the precision in her preparations, and the passion and eagerness in her behavior."
16808,state,"there was an innocence in her character that she may have been carrying from her past, or it could have been a return to a childlike state as a result of trauma beyond her capacity to bear."
16809,where,"was she a well-nurtured, if not overnurtured, child of a wealthy, loving family where she was always taken care of and had not felt the need to grow up?"
16810,where,but where did she get her talent to host guests?
16811,where,was the trauma an element of a swift journey to the time during which things were not so complicated and where a loving mother and father were always there for her?
16812,prisoner,"roya herself seemed to perceive her situation as a consequence of torture, for in her conversation with her former high school teacher, aki, the only prisoner she ever talked to while in ghezel hesar, she suggested that “they [apparently the guards] melted my brain so that there remained nothing in it except water.” this conversation with aki occurred on one of roya’s lucky days on which her loved ones had come."
16813,torture,"for the first time since our coming to this ward, she calmly walked alongside others and conversed with aki about high school; suddenly, she seemed to be jerked back into the site of torture."
16814,cell,"“full of cockroaches and mice, everywhere, my cell, i screamed, begged."
16815,cell,"the cell is dark, very dark."
16816,sink,"but roya was vacillating between two worlds, struggling not to sink in."
16817,wall,"please, sister bakhtiyari, i won’t tap on the wall any more."
16818,cell,"if they see me with you, they will put me in that dark cell again.” the entire evening after this conversation she had squatted in the corner of her cell, tightly holding her knees."
16819,inmates,"we, other inmates, talked about roya and watched her curiously, sympathetically, but always from a distance that seemed so immense and yet so slight."
16820,torture,"didn’t we all play such games to keep our spirits high, to be in touch with something rather than the horror of torture, and to remember the innocence and the joy of our childhood?"
16821,interrogation,"we embraced the risk of stealing soil and seeds on our way to the clinic, to interrogation, or to our family meetings, so that we could plant our new year sabzeh, the green plants we grow for the new year as a symbol of growth."
16822,prisoners,"despite their theatricality, both of us, the resistant prisoners and roya, considered these ceremonious acts to be deadly serious."
16823,prisoners,70  roya  â�prisoners insist on their humanity and struggle to assert themselves as social and creative beings.
16824,prisoners,"prisoners gather all their personal and sociocultural resources to engender an atmosphere of joy, creativity, and rejuvenation, whereas the torturers target any potential sign of happiness and imaginative creation of lively moments among prisoners."
16825,torture,"i t is in the face  of this resilient creativity, not merely of artistic  production but of artistic ways of upholding one’s spirit of joy and life, that torture loses its ability to destroy."
16826,jail,"no wonder that in all these years in jail, both under the shah and in this regime, i realized that prison officials treated any indication of sympathy for someone and any refusal to comply with authority as a criminal and rebellious act, for which prisoners deserved to be severely punished."
16827,prisoners,"in fact, the event leading to the establishment of haji davoud’s dastgah was a minor event undertaken by a group of prisoners who simply cared about their integrity and about one another."
16828,prisoners,"in ghezel hesar, prisoners were forced to attend regular public confessions given by other prisoners."
16829,prisoners,the goal of these confessions was twofold: to humiliate both the speaker and the listener while annulling prisoners’ trust and confidence in themselves and one another; and to give the regime another opportunity for demonizing any opposition organization.
16830,prisoners,"more important, haji davoud claimed that he was concerned about the immorality of his prisoners, who, he suggested, were a deadly danger to society."
16831,prisoners,"he accused the leftist prisoners of being nonbelievers—sex-crazy, corrupt individuals who lacked any values or morals, who shared their women with one another."
16832,prisoners,listening to these confessions was so emotionally disturbing for other prisoners that they preferred to resist attending them and hence be seriously punished than to suffer the pain of bearing witness to these hu-  roya  71  miliating recantations—an attempt that wasn’t always successful since they were usually dragged to the confessions.
16833,power,our resistance renounced the ruthless demonstration of technologies of power exercised on human flesh and souls.
16834,guard,"on a normal day in 1983, a day not worse than any other day in prison, a guard came to one of the women’s wards and announced a new session of confessions for that day."
16835,prisoners,she also ordered the group responsible for the day’s cleaning to take carpets to the hall where all the prisoners would sit and watch the show.
16836,prisoners,cleaning the ward was usually a voluntary job organized by prisoners in our ward.
16837,punishment,"but now, this newly imposed duty created conflicts and various reactions among prisoners: some believed that fighting against haji davoud’s order would be too dangerous since his reputation for punishment was well established."
16838,prisoners,haji davoud’s blood rushed to his face as he heard the prisoners’ response.
16839,prisoners,"a new phase of anticipation began, and until late in the evening when haji was through with his show for the day and came to the ward, prisoners experienced a life of barzakh again."
16840,prisoners,"the beating started, and before long, some of the prisoners were wrapped in blankets and rolled over like a ball from one guard to another while being beaten brutally and violently."
16841,prisoners,"in contrast to claims that suggest we cannot feel others’ pain, my experience is that watching other prisoners being tortured is extremely unbearable."
16842,inmate,"i strongly relate to the words of a woman inmate who was jailed at the same time i was under the islamic republic: “when it was  72  roya  your turn to be tortured your body was in pain, but when it was somebody else’s, it was your soul that was being tortured.” even though i think when one is tortured, never merely one’s body but also one’s soul is inflicted with pain, i still think the way one’s soul burns while one witnesses others’ pain differs from being tortured oneself."
16843,prisoners,"what haji davoud labeled as a preplanned rebellion was a natural reaction initiated by one of the prisoners who, unable to continue watching her friends’ suffering, protested the beating by simply saying, “don’t beat.” her words were contagious, mainly because the feeling was commonly shared."
16844,prisoners,"other prisoners also began saying, “don’t beat,” and in a few minutes all the prisoners in the hall were repeating, “don’t beat.” haji davoud found this incredible."
16845,authority,“how could you dare to protest under my authority and in my prison?
16846,ward,"you’ll pay such a high price for this; just wait and watch!” they were sent back to the ward with broken heads, arms, ribs, but this was only a sample of what was on its way."
16847,power,"i t is this dynamic  of power relations that was exemplified in prison-  ers’ untiring attempts to preserve their connection to rituals, tradition, innovation, and creativity as part of their humanness, to keep their sense of empathy alive, qualities that were the object of suppression under the regimes of surveillance."
16848,taken,"cleaning up, dusting, and trying to solve old problems with family members, neighbors, and friends are some of the tasks taken up before new year."
16849,imprisoned,"the idea that if you haven’t cleaned your place, the whole year you will be a mess was considered a funny idea and somehow superstitious for many of us modern intellectuals before we were imprisoned."
16850,death,the action taken upon our celebration intensified our energies and stimulated our persistence as if it were a matter of life and death.
16851,ward,"for two years, the guards inspected our ward to discover the plants we had grown specifically for the celebration."
16852,prisoners,"both the prisoners and the guards were sharing the same symbolic culture according to which plants personified growth and vitality, depending on the context in which they were being metaphorically used."
16853,taken,"designing these plants in such shapes, instead of their usual form, was to communicate another stratum of this symbolic representation that was more overtly political, although in prison every action taken was extremely political."
16854,imprisonment,"freedom, that illicit word in prison, was invisibly yet clearly inscribed in the wings of our plant-bird who could fly in the blue sky of our free imagination to release us from the imprisonment of our spirit."
16855,jail,this was the reason that the guards would break the wings of our plants to illustrate that no wings would survive in this jail.
16856,freedom,"thus, if a bird alluded to freedom, a taboo word, then  74  roya  a migrating bird, a bird that would fly to a warmer place during winter and fly back in spring, suggested an even stronger confrontation to the system."
16857,prisoners,for the regime it indicated the prisoners’ blunt proposition that winter would be over and spring with its generous smile would embrace every tortured body.
16858,prisoners,"“you are prisoners, and you are supposed to be in isolation."
16859,prisoners,"don’t stick your nose in something that does not have anything to do with you, and don’t assume that we are stupid and don’t understand what you mean when you say the freezing cold winter is leaving and it has to give way to spring with its beautiful, generous, sunny smile.” these are almost the exact words of meisam, the head of the ghezel hesar ward in 1985, in response to the prisoners’ complaints that their letters were not sent to their families."
16860,prisoners,"the irony of the censorship illustrated itself in the creativity of the prisoners in exploring new ways to resist, new symbols to employ to convey their message, and innovative tools to communicate their desire and emotions."
16861,charged,ordinary life could be charged by such intense political implications that the struggle to preserve it appeared existential.
16862,prisoners,"donya, the woman who sat in the entrance section of the ward in ghezel hesar, motionless and totally withdrawn from the rest of the prisoners, seemed to have died before death."
16863,inside,"nothing appeared to exist for donya, nothing inside or outside her."
16864,situation,"roya  75  unlike her, roya was alive, even though in a world that was often outside her present situation; she still felt and experienced emotions."
16865,insane,"paradoxically, this was exactly what typified roya as “insane,” probably even more so than donya was."
16866,where,where was this line drawn?
16867,ward,"except for her one conversation with aki, she made no attempt to reach out to others in the ward."
16868,inmates,"we, on the other hand, refusing to be detached from our fellow inmates, sought new ways to communicate with them even in our solitude."
16869,ward,"in the ward, our efforts concentrated on creating a life as cultural, social beings while accepting the reality of our situation in prison."
16870,where,"she kept living in the clouds where, according to folk tales, dead people go."
16871,death,the world of death was crossing hers somewhere in the foggy sky.
16872,guard,"one day in the middle of roya’s crawling and barking, the guard called out roya’s name."
16873,ward,"while leaving the ward to i don’t know where, her skinny body, her pale face, and her distracted eyes looked so misty that she seemed made of vapor."
16874,ward,did these past months of her life in this bizarre ward have any impact on her?
16875,death,how far was she from the world of death?
16876,where,i never learned where they took her and what happened to her.
16877,state,"3  fozi losing it all  if one knew in advance that everything, including one’s self and the current state of affairs, was bad, what would there be to learn?"
16878,ward,"but fozi had not left it for eighteen days now, and there was only one more bathroom left for about three hundred women in the ward."
16879,building,"the building was old and humid, and we had to wash and sterilize the bathrooms with chlorine every day in order to get rid of the worms."
16880,taken,now they had taken over the whole place—the walls and the floor were covered with them—and they were climbing over fozi’s slim body as though climbing a hill.
16881,death,"during these days she had neither eaten nor drunk, and her face was so still and dusty that death would be frightened at the sight of her."
16882,prisoners,it all started when some of the prisoners tried to help her take a shower after weeks and weeks of sitting and lying down in her own dirt and blood.
16883,imprisoned,"she sat in the hall on the side of the entrance to the yard, in front of the room where two little children and their imprisoned mothers were living— children were a conflicting aspect of prison life, simultaneously a source of joy and pain."
16884,ward,"in the early 1980s, there were sometimes more than thirty children in a ward."
16885,ward,"in 1983, for instance, in the ward where i lived, there were twenty-eight children from a few months to 79  80  fozi  eight years old."
16886,arrested,"thus, in 1985, we had only these two children whose parents had been arrested less than a year earlier."
16887,prisoners,"before taking residence in the corner of the hall, fozi was assigned to one of the rooms occupied mostly by other prisoners who had been arrested for their affiliation with the iranian militant organization â�mojahedin-khalgh-e iran, called mojahedin by resistant prisoners, and monafeghin, or hypocrites, by the regime and collaborators."
16888,ward,"in fact, during the several months since she had been brought to our ward, we witnessed her situation worsening every day."
16889,prisoners,"watching her rapid changes, those prisoners who had known her since her first arrest were more shocked than the rest of us."
16890,arrested,she was a beautiful young pregnant woman when she was arrested for the first time in 1981.
16891,ward,"earning haji davoud’s trust by giving information about the members of other organizations in prison, she became the head of the ward."
16892,situation,"she was arrested in one of the mojahedin’s secret houses with some wellknown members of the organization, hence in a more serious situation  fozi  81  than the first time."
16893,torture,"in 1984, through the information given under torture by one of the members involved, an underground network of the mojahedin organization in prison was discovered."
16894,taken,"all the members connected to this network or who even knew about it were taken to a dastgah, although to a different one from that built for leftists."
16895,interrogation,"there was not even a moment of escape from interrogation, never an instant to breathe in privacy."
16896,prisoners,every day these mojahed prisoners were obliged to read and memorize islamic texts or political propaganda and to listen to the prison radio’s special programs for several hours.
16897,prisoners,"as though the prisoners were in school, the interrogators played the role of their teachers and would test them on these materials, except that here a failing grade would be punished by severe torture and humiliation."
16898,situation,"only two, out of more than fifty women, came out of this situation unbroken, one of whom committed suicide a year later."
16899,arrest,"they assisted in the process of arrest, interrogation, torture, and execution with  82  fozi  a wide array of motivations and circumstances."
16900,torture,"some initiated their activities to gain personal advantage, while others were driven to the process to escape torture or were within the throes of psychological chaos."
16901,panopticon,collaborators are a crucial element of the panopticon of the state and the modern system of penal surveillance.
16902,prisoners,"for prisoners, collaborators embody lost souls who remind them of their own potential moral degeneration, tempting them to submit and find relief."
16903,prisoners,the intense humiliation and shame induce the perception of themselves as so unworthy and outcast that they must continuously deny any connection between themselves and other prisoners.
16904,prisoners,this increased existential gulf between the collaborators and other prisoners undermines the legitimacy of their suffering in the eyes of other prisoners and blinds them to the fact that the collaborators are also subjects of these technologies of power.
16905,prisoners,"this terrifying image of a collapsed or imploded self and its monstrous shadow menacing other prisoners reminds them of their own possible fate, alienates them from these monstrous others, and excludes the collaborators from their community as morally flawed."
16906,prisoners,"she was already disliked by the leftists and other prisoners not allied to the mojahedin, and now she was hated by her own friends, among whom she found her worst enemies."
16907,roads,"all the roads were dead ends with her enemies’ blazing, hateful eyes watching her everywhere she looked."
16908,inside,"swallowing its poison inside and out, she became unable to pass through all the labyrinths of this world."
16909,where,"moreover, where can one escape if one’s own self emerges as the most dangerous adversary?"
16910,death,"every day, you feel more and more humiliated, yet no possibility of death or release appears in sight."
16911,punishment,"if his disappointment comes with dropping the rock, your punishment disallows any chance of achievement."
16912,where,is there a way out of these dead-end paths where the shattered soul can put its pieces back together?
16913,where,"she, a nurse whose job was taking care of injured and sick people, ended up in prison and in haji’s â�dastgah, where she inflicted pain on her own friends’ bodies and was herself also beaten by her friends."
16914,ward,"atefeh, a leftist woman, a former colleague of â�shakar’s in the hospital where they had both worked as nurses, was still in shock days after we saw shakar in ward 7 in ghezel hesar."
16915,cell,"sitting, almost always, on the same corner of the second story of the three-story metal beds in her cell, she would either read the qur’an or look at us with hate glowing in her eyes."
16916,possession,"an empty can was her main possession besides her clothes; she would carry it everywhere, and once in a while she would vomit in it with amazing indifference, which occurred frequently during the day."
16917,inside,was she throwing up all the hate inside her to find some sense of relief?
16918,ward,"f o z i , c o v ered in her b lack chad o r ,  was pushed into our ward  on a dismal early evening in 1986."
16919,prisoners,"when she was thrown into the narrow hall of the first floor of the two-story ward 246, into the midst of hundreds of prisoners who were walking hastily as though headed somewhere, i heard the whisper among mojahedin prisoners, “oh look, she is fozi, that awful monster, the evil.” fozi was already in action before anyone had the chance to react to her arrival."
16920,prisoners,"there were others who argued that even if  fozi  85  mad, she deserved her misery, for she was paying for the horrible harm she had inflicted on other prisoners."
16921,ward,"the whole ward was disturbed by her constant repetitive curses and knocks on the metallic bars, which made an extremely annoying sound."
16922,gate,a guard came to the gate and opened it.
16923,guard,"fozi stopped screaming while the guard was beating her up, but as soon as the guard closed the door and walked away, fozi began all over again."
16924,ward,fati yelled at fozi to “shut up” and told her that her voice and knocking were disturbing the children in the ward.
16925,ward,"obviously, the prison officials were entertained by this situation, which had disturbed the whole ward."
16926,gate,"the children had become restless, and nobody could sleep, especially those of us in the front rooms closer to the gate."
16927,entrapment,"fozi, however, standing on her feet the entire time, without eating or drinking or even using the bathroom, having grown extremely pale and almost at the point of completely losing her voice, did not seem to feel anything except rage, or was it a feeling of entrapment so overwhelming she could not feel anything else?"
16928,where,"if i could tell them where i have been and what i have seen, they would know how frivolous their conflict is, i think to myself."
16929,executed,"on the other side, fakhri, one of my best friends, who was executed in 1981, still looks at me with sharpness and confidence in her eaglelike eyes."
16930,where,i wonder how i can learn again to speak through silence in such a noisy world where too many words circulate so that silence is rarely heard.
16931,torture,how should or could we compare the reactions of those who participated in executing their own friends to those who put their lives in danger to protect their beloved ones from persecution and torture?
16932,torture,—rumi  “behrouz was bathing in his own blood when the interrogators untied him from the ceiling of the torture room where he was hung for the last several days.
16933,torture,"the torturers were taking turns, but he was being interminably beaten, either hung from the ceiling so that his feet could not touch the floor and his arms were stretching to the point of being torn from the joints, or on the torture bed or on the floor, where all of them would attack him as if he were a dangerous animal."
16934,inmates,"instead, it was the language that was speaking him, so transparent he had become, yet so unreachable.” nahid’s deep, dark, sad eyes were shining with pride as she was listening to the story of her husband, behrouz, told by one of our fellow inmates, soudi."
16935,torture,"it was a year after behrouz’s death under torture, and we were having a secret memorial ceremony for him in the ward."
16936,torture,"soudi, who had spent several days in the torture room with behrouz, had much  88  fozi  to say."
16937,torture,"she had come to know behrouz and felt extremely close to him, paradoxically, while they were both going through hell in the torture room, a place where nothing is supposed to exist for you except pain and its agony."
16938,situation,"during those several days and nights he used every chance to encourage me and to remind me that my situation was not going to last forever, and i was going to be fine."
16939,inside,"at night, when they stopped torturing me and untied me to goâ€to sleep, he was still hung up, and i could hear his painful sighs, which he tried so hard to keep inside."
16940,torture,"his candid speech of silence was a slap in their face, so humiliating that it drove his interrogators crazy.” such a strange irony that torture’s main purpose is to drive the tortured person out of her or his mind, while, in fact, torture itself is a crazy game in which both parties play deranged roles, especially if they both take it to its extremes."
16941,torture,the torturer speaks his power through the torture devices.
16942,torture,"for the interrogator, the person under torture is cut off from her or his subjectivity; instead, she or he becomes the subject of the torturer’s task to claim his, and therefore the torture’s, victory."
16943,power,"through the violence, the interrogator exercises personal power  fozi  89  while at the same time fulfills a task."
16944,torture,"by objectifying the person under torture, he invests his own self, for to be able to perform such a monstrous job, one has to be persuaded that there is at stake—beyond a state duty— a search for the redemption of one’s own crushed identity."
16945,torture,"the manic reaction of the torturer is only justifiable through the inherited insanity of the torture itself, though it is rationalized as an unpleasant yet necessary act to protect the well-being of society."
16946,tortured,"the tortured person who resists confession, however, subverts all the rationale behind a normal response to the body in pain."
16947,tortured,this abnormality manifests itself in the ways in which the tortured person takes pride in her or his strength to push the torturers into madness.
16948,prisoners,"one of the joyous moments that the most resistant prisoners experienced occurred when their torturers got furious at them, called them names, and beat them more severely; it meant that they had accomplished the goal of their resistance."
16949,prisoners,one  of  these  inspiring  st o ries  for resistant prisoners was  about reza’s resilience.
16950,torture,"reza was a leftist activist who was arrested in late 1982 and went through a long period of severe, relentless torture, even though like nearly all the leftists, his activities posed no threat to national security."
16951,torture,"thus, when subjecting us to torture, especially those of us who were arrested after 1982 and were affiliated with the leftist organizations that by then had been dismantled, interrogators knew very well that we had no sensitive information to offer them."
16952,prisoners,"the main goal of this torture was therefore not really to obtain information, though torture is never only about obtaining information, but even more so here it was to force prisoners into humiliation, self-annihilation through forced confessions and recantations."
16953,torture,"reza, however, refused to play a part in this process by embracing his death under torture."
16954,arrested,"later, when i was arrested, rahim, who had been reza’s main interrogator, became my interrogator."
16955,torture,"time and again he attempted to terrify me by reminding me how i, too, could die under torture if i refused to talk, as had reza or others like him."
16956,death,"yet every single time he told me the story of reza’s death, he grew furious, even at the mention of his name."
16957,power,"although he pretended to be concerned that he died as an unbeliever, the real source of his agony was revealed to me in the expression of outrage that “in dying on me this wicked man was trying to prove that his will is stronger than the power of my lashes.” interestingly, he seemed to feel an urge to mention reza’s name rather frequently, as though haunted by his ghost."
16958,taken,his outrage was not so much about the subversive knowledge that reza had taken to his grave but rather about his undefeatable character.
16959,torture,"fozi  91  in his dying moment, reza had opened his bloodied eyes to look at his torturers’ angry and disappointed faces, victoriously smiled, and through his broken jaw and injured mouth said, “sorry, you lost; your torture lost; i am dying, utterly free; good-bye.” with a glorious smile on his deformed and smashed face, he closed his eyes, sighed with relief, and died while the torturers were insanely waving their hovering whips over his dead body."
16960,freedom,reza had “crossed into a country” into which his interrogators “could not enter.” reza had entered the land of freedom.
16961,death,"who belonged more to the category of the lunatic: reza, who conceived of his death as his victory, or the torturers, who sought their identity in defeating a helplessly bound person undergoing unlimited pain?"
16962,death,"reza’s rebellion was against the kind of death that denied his desire to know and share his knowledge with others, and to remain present to himself and his community."
16963,question,"as a modern human, he cultivated in himself the attitude of daring to know and question."
16964,power,he defied the power that deprived him of active participation in creation of his world.
16965,exercise,"he believed that he could emerge as a dynamic participant in making and remaking his present only through the exercise of his free will, which entailed the possibility of questioning, criticizing, and resisting what restrained his creativity and dynamism."
16966,question,"ironically, the very same conduct that defines the integrity of a modern human being simultaneously puts the person’s sanity into question when she or he wills to live and, if necessary, die accordingly."
16967,death,"death, in this sense, is viewed less in relation to the prolongation of life than in how that life is lived."
16968,torture,he was lying down on the torture bed with his feet tied up and his hands open.
16969,jail,"despite the inhumanity of the torture, what else breaks us down or holds us intact?” soudi’s questions were those of many of us in jail."
16970,torture,"but what was certain was the fact that for soudi, behrouz’s resistance had generated a sense of hope and showed her a power beyond the destruction of torture that not only allowed her to survive the torture but taught her the art of living and dying."
16971,death,"it is in this light that his death connects to and reveals so much about life, more than so many others whose lives do not seem to embrace others in any meaningful sense."
16972,inmate,"mozhdeh, an inmate with whom i was walking at the moment, said, “she is totally repulsed by any suggestion of life."
16973,inside,"her resentment toward us is because we remind her of the difference between who she was before and who she is now.” i wondered if she was throwing up in disgust and anger, destroying her insides, or if these were symptoms of the last vestiges of life she had suppressed inside."
16974,escaped,"in order to learn it, however, you have to endure a severe ordeal.” we tolerated that severe ordeal for so long that the sacred word escaped our memory."
16975,war,"i t was after 1 9 8 8 ,  after the bloody war between iran and iraq  ended, after those freezing, snowy days when after every meeting with  94  fozi  our families, wives would return to the ward as widows, for from their families they heard about their husband’s execution."
16976,execution,"it was after we had our new color tv, which was brought to the ward in the aftermath of the news of the mass execution of our husbands, brothers, and friends."
16977,prisoners,"it was after we watched, on this new tv, the remaining male prisoners marching in the streets of tehran, announcing to the world that “evin is a university, not a prison."
16978,execution,there is no execution or torture in iran’s prisons” and that “we are devoted muslims redeemed from our sinful past.” they sent messages to us: “stop fighting.
16979,imprisoned,there is no point in fighting; they will win.” it was after those men and women who accepted the regime’s condition were released that few of us remained imprisoned.
16980,imprisonment,"in the evenings, if we still felt like talking, we would sit and recall those early years of our imprisonment, so far and yet so near, when we did not have any space to even sit in the ward."
16981,arrested,"the memories of the past were fading away, and new people were rarely arrested, nor were they brought to our wards if they were; so our connection to the exterior world was diminishing."
16982,prisoners,"the former prisoners’ handwriting on the walls was the only trace left from those thousands whose friendship, laughter, whispers, screams, pain, fear, madness, and even betrayal once filled these jails with life and death."
16983,death,"now it seemed that death had consumed this place, and loneliness was the color with which everything was painted."
16984,confinement,"and it was after our women friends returned to the wards, from that hellish period they spent in solitary confinement, where they were whipped five times a day, at prayer times, until they would say they were muslims and agreed to pray."
16985,state,"it was during the summer of 1988, when the entire world had been closed to us, when all the visits with families had  fozi  95  stopped, newspapers and television were taken away, and we had lived in a state of constant suspense not knowing what to expect and when."
16986,court,"while waiting our turn to be taken to the court and tried, while knowing our friends were under lashes, we were perplexed as to what to wish for."
16987,torture,"wishing for their return meant hoping that they would give up on their beliefs, which also meant the arrival of our turn for torture, while desiring any delay in taking us would favor the prolongation of their suffering."
16988,inmate,"night after night we also cried with zari, another inmate who like mahin was forced to utter her ashhad, profession of her belief in islam— which, ironically, muslims also recite at the moment of their death and for the dead."
16989,confinement,"she had been mournfully crying for the past few nights since her return from solitary confinement in āsāyeshgāh, the place to rest, after she had agreed to profess she was a muslim and that she would pray—in fact, they had forced her to pray in front of the guards."
16990,building,"to us, on the third floor, the echo of her moaning cries coming from the first floor of the three-story building, called amoozeshgah, the place for education, sounded like the wailing of ghosts."
16991,inmate,"nima parvaresh, a male inmate in  96  fozi  the 1980s, narrated a similar story: “at the noon and evening prayer times they lashed us, forty lashes, twenty for each time."
16992,prisons,"soon we were mixed with common criminals, for the first time in the recent history of the political prisons, where we would see young teenagers blossoming in prison only to be raped byâ€the interrogators."
16993,escaped,"i went to see her mother who, while softly crying, told me that she was happy for her little girl since she escaped the suffering of the poverty and starvation  fozi  97  the family had to endure."
16994,death,it was a moment in which i promised myself that i would fight for a world in which no family would consider their child’s death a blessing for the child and the family because of the cruelty of their lives.
16995,authorities,"standing up to my teacher and taking the issue all the way to the principal of the school and to the parents’ meetings, i learned that if i chose to resist authorities, i had to be ready to pay the price."
16996,injustice,"i was concerned that i would watch injustice and pass by, that i would get used to undressing others like mahin after her suicide attempt and then have a casual dinner."
16997,torture,"i had been witnessing pain, suffering, and torture for so many years now that i was terrified of becoming numb to them."
16998,torture,"the interrogator says, “now you’ll see how pathetic your heroic man has become.” in the middle of the torture room, hamid is tied up to a metallic bed surrounded by four interrogators, all of whom are holding cable whips in their hands, beating him all over his body."
16999,situation,i am confused about the appropriate reaction in such a situation.
17000,power,"should i stay quiet and nonchalant in order not to give them the power over my emotions, or should i resist watching my beloved being tortured in front of me?"
17001,torture,"e still undecided and in shock, i am standing in the middle of the torture room where hamid’s feet are getting more and more swollen with every blow of the cables."
17002,where,he doesn’t know where my sister is.
17003,cell,"they would give me a pen, which i would hold on one end and one of them on the other to direct me to the cell, while i am blindfolded."
17004,where,"where are his expressive, bright, lovely eyes?"
17005,arrest,"it was your chest that warmed my heart when the news of the execution of our closest friends was sucking the blood out of my veins, during those gruesome years from 1981 to the time of our arrest in early 1983."
17006,arrest,"how rapidly it had all passed, and how strangely life had changed around us between that lovely spring day when i had first met you and the spring day of our arrest, yet how deeply you had grown in me that i could not remember the time i had not loved you."
17007,war,"the iran-iraq war had not begun yet, and the “spring of freedom,” lasting from the revolution of 1979 until the iran-iraq war in september 1980, though rapidly fading, was still alive."
17008,arrested,i had been arrested on the street while walking with one of our male friends.
17009,arrested,"to avoid being arrested for walking on the street with someone of the opposite sex who was not related, which could have led us to evin and our death, i had to tell the guards he was my cousin."
17010,guilty,"it was two days after that we went to visit your sister in the hospital, for they could not stop her heavy bleeding, and i was feeling so guilty for having caused this, but you sat there and cried with her."
17011,killing,yet how surprisingly content he was that his father had to prove his love for his god by killing his dear son—poor sons and poor fathers who were themselves once their fathers’ sons.
17012,where,where were my hands then?
17013,where,where was the well into which the incarnated yousuf was to be thrown?
17014,torture,an early school for torture training—how fast and how early we had to learn!
17015,ordered,"the little commander, hussein, ordered two of us to grab masoud’s arms and legs, and the rest had to beat him up."
17016,power,"but hussein’s fists and belt, which kept slashing over our bodies, were stronger than our tolerance and power of our resistance."
17017,where,i cannot recall where on his body and how many times i hit him.
17018,death,"shakar, whose hatred was manifest even in the change in the shade of the color of her eyes, would later seek redemption through death."
17019,death,"could it be that they could no longer carry around the body that was saved at the cost of their own soul and others’ suffering and it thus had to be eliminated, either through madness, where the soul loses touch with history and memory, or through death?"
17020,criminal,"since that day in the meadow when my hands became the hands of a criminal, when i participated in beating masoud, i have been forced to watch many fathers beat their sons while the sons in turn beat their sisters and wives."
17021,torture,"bearing witness to the cruelty of children to one another and to  fozi  105  animals, i have been horrified to realize how deeply rooted torture is in our daily experiences, collective consciousness, and historical memory."
17022,executed,"years later, hussein, the thirteen-year-old boy who, like hassan, had himself been beaten by his teachers and who orchestrated and executed the beating of masoud by forcing our participation in it, told me that he had promised himself that he would become the fiercest teacher."
17023,inside,"what kind of pain was he trying to suppress inside himself that compelled him to bring, albeit unconsciously, this much injury and suffering onto himself?"
17024,torture,i had sworn that i would no longer silently watch anyone’s subjection to torture.
17025,torture,"however, time and again, i found myself in situations where, though not directly, my presence intensified the torture inflicted on others."
17026,inmate,"yet later, in prison, my presence pushed soosan, a woman inmate, to take a more outspoken stand that may have caused harsher treatment by her interrogator."
17027,prisoners,"during my interrogation soon after my arrest in 1983, rahim, my main interrogator, was trying to break my resistance by bragging about his merciless treatment of those prisoners who had not given in and had  106  fozi  thus died, either under torture or by execution—though he could not hide the rage and disappointment lurking under his apparently victorious tone."
17028,interrogation,"to prove his point, that particular day he called me for interrogation, where i met the woman whom i would later know as soosan."
17029,arrest,"i would also learn that soosan had been a mere supporter of, without any affiliation with, a leftist organization before her arrest in 1981."
17030,imprisonment,"nearly two years after her imprisonment, she was still refusing to publicly recant and renounce her past."
17031,interrogation,"that day, rahim had called soosan and me for interrogation in the same room to use each of us against the other."
17032,prisoners,"both blindfolded, we sat awkwardly in the interrogation room while rahim began his show first by asking soosan whether or not she had changed her mind about mosahebeh—an interview, but in fact, it meant public recantation—and was now willing to appear in the husseiniyeh, the large hall in prison that was mainly used for prisoners’ public recantation, to utter her renunciation of all the dissident organizations."
17033,executed,you like to be executed?
17034,death,why do you have a death wish?
17035,prisoners,"but then rahim began going on and on, now lecturing me about how soosan’s case proved that those prisoners who pride themselves on maintaining their stand against the regime and act courageously among themselves are in fact cowards when facing the interrogators; that they do not dare to speak and stand up for their beliefs because their beliefs are based on fake materialistic ideals, which cannot endure the power of islam and the brothers’ lashes."
17036,execution,"later i would be taken to the same ward as soosan, and i would realize that the game rahim played that day about her choice between execution and freedom by merely accepting or denying all dissident organizations and ideas was not a mere show; that in fact she was to have been executed but was given twelve years’ time only because the circumstances changed from 1983 and the execution sentences were less summarily given, at least until the massacre of 1988."
17037,execution,"my sister-in-law would tell me that i could have convinced hamid to survive execution by submitting and answering yes to the interrogators’ questions about whether or not he was a muslim, if he was willing to pray as a muslim, and if he supported the islamic republic, the three questions that determined the life or death of the leftists in the summer of 1988."
17038,law,my brother-in-law would look me in the eye and ask if i thought a belief was more important than a person i loved more than my life.
17039,death,how was i to elucidate this obscure point that it was not merely about life and death but about the kind of life and death that one has to choose?
17040,torture,"but for my brother-in-law, this would all be incomprehensible, for perhaps unlike me, his body and soul did not ache with the memories of humiliation, the pain of which is more excruciating than all the physical injuries that one’s body endures under torture."
17041,ward,"it was eight in the evening when the guards rushed into the ward and forced us out of our cells, even out of the bathrooms."
17042,wall,we were taken to zir-e hasht and made to stand up facing the wall so that we could not see the guards behind us.
17043,taken,"with our eyes blindfolded, we could not predict what  108  fozi  they were planning for us, as they had us wait for about half an hour, during which time coughing, sneezing, or any motion was punished by sudden blows by wooden clubs that were taken from dismantled fruit boxes with their nails still on."
17044,ordered,"the guards announced that they would be calling roll, but we had to respond precisely in the manner they ordered."
17045,prisoner,each prisoner had to wait to be beaten on her head while she pronounced her name.
17046,situation,"we had no chance to discuss the situation and make a collective decision, so we each reacted based on our own instincts and feelings."
17047,wall,"we all stood against the wall, silent, while the guards broke the clubs on the two young women’s heads."
17048,taken,the guards continued beating them until they both passed out and were taken to the clinic.
17049,ward,"finally, when the guards’ exhaustion overcame their rage, they told us to go back to the ward, while cracking the remaining clubs on us as we passed them to enter the ward."
17050,prisoners,"i had supposedly made a logical decision, along with many other prisoners who also refused to sign the renunciation form, not to spend my energy on small fights with the guards."
17051,torture,"i presumed that we had reached a logical conclusion regarding our capacity to tolerate the torture, but i was hardly satisfied with the rationale."
17052,prisoners,"i knew prisoners who, unable to endure more pressure, decided to sign the renunciation form."
17053,inmates,they honestly admitted to their fellow inmates their failure to endure the hardship any longer and were either released then or played safe until they could be released.
17054,inmates,"among them were, however, inmates who behaved more ethically and sensitively toward others than some of the seemingly more resistant inmates whose conflicted emotions were projected onto others and made their lives miserable."
17055,torture,"was it not as, or even more, important to not get accustomed to living under torture, violence, and degradation as refusing to submit to the regime’s condition for release?"
17056,justice,"i began to believe that our energy to resist and to live humanely is initiated and reproduced by our belief in justice for ourselves and others, and these are inseparable from each other."
17057,question,"nevertheless, the question of how i was going to deal with my damaged soul remained."
17058,ward,"that morning we returned to the ward, like beaten dogs, with our heads swollen and injured, our feet and legs bruised and trembling, and our souls shattered by the pain and humiliation."
17059,prisoners,"some prisoners ignored the pain of their souls, as if nothing had happened, while others hated themselves, and still others turned the pain into rage toward the regime."
17060,where,"despite all these meditations, these moral dilemmas repeated themselves in impossible situations where any decision was harmful one way or another."
17061,jail,"since i have been out of jail and in the united states, i have come to think of nearly every decision as a matter of life and death; therefore, i avoid making decisions until i am forced to do so."
17062,guilt,"how was i supposed to distinguish between all those complicated emotions of guilt, fear, and curiosity and react to them appropriately?"
17063,guilt,"refusing to tell my father overwhelmed me with guilt, as if i were sinful, especially considering my shameless curiosity to comprehend naser’s deviant sexual behavior."
17064,where,i sat by the window where naser would stand in our backyard and put himself on display.
17065,situation,"my concern for my father’s safety forced me into an impossible situation of constant fear, pressure, and shame."
17066,prisoners,how many moral and ethical dilemmas have led me to perpetually ask myself a similar question: “what should i do?”  e the air was thick with the perturbed sighs of prisoners who with their eyes wide open witnessed fozi’s inappropriate behavior—she had taken her pants off in the room she shared with more than forty other women and was inserting a bar of soap into her vagina.
17067,prisoners,"many of the prisoners looked frightened and agitated, while fozi showed no sign of awareness of others’ presence."
17068,prisoners,"lying down naked in her bed, touching herself in front of everyone, she was undermining an extremely sensitive aspect of the iranian political prisoners’ unwritten moral and social code of conduct."
17069,where,this was the point where everyone could tell she had really gone mad.
17070,prisoner,"her madness was undoubtedly confirmed, for no political prisoner in her right mind could ever have done what she was doing, getting naked in front of others, but even worse, touching herself."
17071,prisoners,"from the prisoners’ perspective, she had violated all the social rules of propriety that made us political subjects."
17072,taken,"in this new position, instead of being viewed as a traitor and consequently the target of hatred, she was  112  fozi  perceived as a sick person who needed to be confined and taken care of."
17073,punishment,"this new status, however, did not grant fozi the same sympathy from other prisoners as it had for roya, the young woman in ghezel hesar who relived her punishment of being forced to crawl and bark like a dog and host imaginary guests."
17074,infamous,this had partially to do with fozi’s infamous background as a collaborator.
17075,ward,"during the period in which we were in the same ward as roya, her sense of reality was never so clouded as to influence her basic social behavior."
17076,insane,"anything that the leftists touched with their wet hands was rendered polluted, according to prison officials and many collaborators, including fozi, before she was insane."
17077,assault,"the sexual expression of fozi’s abnormality was perceived as more animalistic, while her irregular ways of eating, talking, and sleeping were no less erratic, since she “had lost it.” the only difference was our perceptions about these activities, since for us, her sexual behavior was conceived as an assault on our collective morality, secular or religious."
17078,ward,"we were in ward 325 in evin, to which we had recently been moved."
17079,ward,ward 325 was one of the strangest wards during my years in prison.
17080,evin,"we loved the fact that we could stay in the yard most of the day, and that in the evenings we could hear children’s shouts and laughter from luna park, the closest children’s park to evin prison."
17081,ward,"perhaps it was this daily access to the yard and its beauty that rendered fozi’s presence at once more tolerable and yet more disturbing, for the ward was often humid and suffocating."
17082,ward,"it was here that one day, after eating about forty or so cooked eggs, she lay on the floor right by the door between the yard and the ward and stayed there for days, apparently asleep, while her urine and menstrual blood made the ward unbearable."
17083,ward,the flies and cockroaches were having their feast but also making the ward a generous host for epidemic skin problems and other diseases.
17084,jail,"on one of these days atefeh, our leftist friend who was a nurse outside the jail, took fozi to the bathroom to give her a shower."
17085,where,"fozi refused to get dressed and lay down on the bathroom floor where  114  fozi  she stayed for eighteen days until the guards came, beat her skinny, unkempt body, and eventually took her out of the bathroom."
17086,killing,the mojahedin outside prison did not have to take the risk of punishing her betrayal by killing her.
17087,death,"she died, but her death had a significant impact on others."
17088,death,"her death was a way for her to become alive again, or at least validate her past."
17089,court,"in 1988, when they called mojahedin women to the court and asked whether they wished to collaborate or be executed, shakar responded with joy and certainty that she would not collaborate, or so her surviving friends relate."
17090,executed,"she was executed, while those who survived remembered her better days and felt sympathy for the torment she had experienced."
17091,evin,"may i die for you, hamid evin, hall # 3, room 66  a wallet hamid made from the thread of his socks during the period of his interrogation."
17092,torture,his feet were still so badly injured from torture that he could not wear socks.
17093,death,"—hafiz, the green sea of heaven when we arrive at the site of burial and put the corpse down in the direction of mecca to pray the salat l-gnaza in front of it, the prayer of the dead, as we contemplate the corpse, the gaze of death slowly takes hold of each one of us."
17094,death,"there is a moment of silence, when sitting on the ground we see death, and we are colonized by its overwhelming thought."
17095,where,"and we lose ourselves in the infinity of that vision, where everything becomes indifferent."
17096,death,"it is the earth of forgetting and makes us blind, once again, to the paralyzing vision of death."
17097,death,"—stefania pandolfo, impasse of the angels  roudabeh: deceiving life for the sake of death the angel, however, did not show herself to roudabeh when she was â�taken to see the corpse of her brother and was seized by the gaze of death."
17098,ward,"when her name was announced on the loudspeaker of the prison ward, she was walking in the yard with her friends."
17099,cell,"the guards took her to her brother’s cell, where she saw his battered body, 121  122  kobra  his smashed face, and his swollen and infected feet, heavily and irreversibly possessed by death."
17100,cell,he had saved himself from the viciousness of the unbearable torture by hanging himself from the door of his cell.
17101,cell,"looking at her brother’s lifeless body in that somber cell, where probably no angel would dare to come, roudabeh experienced the encounter with the absolute other."
17102,ward,"she walked back to the ward, ate her dinner, brushed her teeth, and went to bed, but she performed all these activities as if they were some residual habits from a world to which she no longer belonged."
17103,imprisoned,"her feet were still imprisoned in this place, while her soul had already stepped out, and in so doing, she had lost the means of utterance."
17104,awaiting,her spirit hung in the air awaiting her body’s release from the agony of this prolonged anticipation.
17105,inmates,she lived with the strangers she once knew as her fellow inmates.
17106,imprisonment,was she aware of her imprisonment in evin prison?
17107,death,"a few days after her encounter with death, roudabeh’s repetitive suicide attempts began."
17108,imprisoned,"stolen pills, which she would take at night, were not enough for her imprisoned body to fly out of this alien world."
17109,state,"were these attempts her struggle to call back life through experiencing physical pain, or were they her way of trying to cross the line into her brother’s world, that other territory, a desire her confused state of mind did not allow her to draw to its ultimate end?"
17110,death,"we took turns watching over her to rescue her from death, by which she was already possessed."
17111,death,"if she were already captured by death, and trapped in the everyday world she shared with us, why couldn’t she be more vigorous and successful in her suicide attempts?"
17112,prisoners,"some prisoners perceived her behavior as an indica-  kobra  123  tion of her need for attention, thus insincere and pretentious."
17113,prisoners,"some of my fellow prisoners believed that, despite her alienation and depression, she was still more in touch with life than death so that she could not seriously hurt herself."
17114,state,"roudabeh’s experience seemed like neither living nor dying, but a state of barzakh, where one is neither alive nor dead, unable to live or die."
17115,death,this is a realm of extreme deprivation where life and death have both perished.
17116,death,"the gaze of death by which she was haunted had virtually transformed her into a ghost, without the dramatic fear such an apparition normally provokes."
17117,insane,"melancholy and despair overtook her, and before we knew how, we had identified her place as in the world of the insane, the threshold of that land of the absolute other but still occupying an edge of life."
17118,where,"roudabeh withdrew to that other territory where, even while living so close to us, there was no common language with which we could cross the line between us."
17119,ward,she returned to the ward acting normal.
17120,question,"she would not initiate conversation, but if asked a question, she would briefly respond."
17121,taken,"she had obviously preplanned everything, taken all her medication at once, and gone to a sleep from which she knew she would not awaken."
17122,death,"it was as if we had been tricked by her gesture of playing normal, followed by her sudden, powerful act, an ironic living for the sake of death."
17123,power,"in exercising her power over her life and death, roudabeh’s only weapon was her life, and she had reclaimed it by eradicating it."
17124,jail,"there was no angel in jail who could sprinkle a handful of earth over roudabeh’s head to return her to the world and its affairs, after she was seized by the gaze of death at the sight of her brother’s body, to which she had been an unwilling witness."
17125,death,"roudabeh was, however, bewitched by death."
17126,power,"through her, death spoke and utilized its power to consume life while her living, if one may speak of it as such, had become practice for dying death."
17127,death,"â�because of this drive for death and this possession by it, roudabeh deceived and used life to destroy it."
17128,death,"after death, her face presented the enigma of a strange peace, a victorious smile so unfathomable to us then that the irony confused us."
17129,death,"kobra  125  living in the face of death i have never been afraid of death even though its hands were more fragile than triviality my fear is, however, of dying in a land in which the grave digger’s wage is worth more than a human being’s freedom."
17130,situation,the revolution in iran had created such a peculiar situation that every aspect of people’s life was affected by it.
17131,situation,"silence, the only possible language for such an unspeakable situation, spoke to us."
17132,death,"events like these directed our rage toward organized riots for freedom and against the life and death enforced by a dominating system under which, as shamlu, my favorite poet, would have said, “the wages of grave diggers outweighed the worth of human freedom.” i did not see another way to channel my rage against such brutality and its consequent tragedy than to speak out."
17133,imprisonment,"years later, however, when i was released from my second imprisonment, my mother-in-law looked me in the eye and asked, “how could you go to prison with hamid and come back without him?"
17134,jail,"i understood, logically, that she was simply imagining herself in my shoes and that her question was an expression of her bafflement as to what it must have felt like to go to jail with the love of your life and return without him."
17135,law,"for she herself had lost the two most significant loves of her life, her son, hamid, and her husband, my father-in-law, who had had a stroke and died while we were still in prison."
17136,death,"kobra  127  in silence, i swallowed my grief and hid my emotions whenever i heard these kinds of questions about my husband’s death, as if i could have saved him; as though somehow i could and should have convinced him to choose life over death."
17137,jailed,"my first encounter with one of my brothersin-law after twelve years, since he had left iran and resided in europe and i had been jailed, was another of these incidents that endured in my memory."
17138,roads,he had driven on snowy roads aâ€long way from another european capital in order to see me.
17139,execution,"no longerâ€a teenager, this grown man was now telling me how painful it had been for him to hear of his brother’s execution not from his own family but through a friend’s phone call, on one unforgettable early morning."
17140,executed,"“imagine being awakened by a phone call, and there is someone on the other side of the line asking you if a particular first and last name is in fact that of your brother, and when you inquire why he is asking this question and confirm that the name is in fact that of your brother, he sighs and tells you that your brother has been among those executed in iran whose names had been announced by radio israel."
17141,law,"i was so angry at my family that i did not talk to them for a while.” i tried to imagine his pain and anger—i could not have reminded him how i had learned about all my losses, not only of hamid, but of my aunt, my father-in-law, my cousin, ."
17142,death,"i tried to contemplate how particularly agonizing this must have felt for him since he was abroad, safe and sound, not knowing his family was grieving for his brother’s deathâ€and now he had to grieve without them."
17143,execution,"he must have,â€of course, been very outraged, at the injustice of his time, at the brutality of the regime, at himself for having been enjoying his time with his girlfriend while his brother was taken for execution, while his mother was  128  kobra  â�mourning."
17144,question,"before i could say anything, he repeated the question now in specific terms—“what ideology is worth my beautiful, kind brother’s life?”—assuming that hamid had died for marxism."
17145,prisoners,"i could have ignored the political massacre of 1988 that had cost the lives of thousands of political prisoners, including hamid, and told him that he had died to refuse submitting to a bare life."
17146,prisoners,"the truth was that hamid and i, and many other prisoners, believed that to surrender to the regime and to denounce our past, regardless of what we presently believed, was to allow ourselves to be reduced to a merely organic life, a life in which one’s survival comes at the cost of one’s subjectivity."
17147,question,"yet my brother-in law could have argued, and rightly so, that the very question of whether or not a bare life is worth living is hinged upon a set of beliefs or a worldview and is therefore ideological."
17148,justice,"for people live believing in something; we all have a sense of ethics or an idea of justice, whether we live accordingly or not."
17149,jail,"yet time and again, i have found myself lost in the labyrinth of strange worlds i have come to inhabit since my release from jail, both in iran and later in the united states, my place of residence since 1994."
17150,justice,"each and every time, my urge to reawaken my senses, and my urge to  kobra  129  seek justice have demanded of me to recultivate my ability to listen to the voices from the graves and their echoes in the future."
17151,prisoner,it seemed that the image of this vulnerable woman did not match that of a resistant political prisoner.
17152,power,"it was not merely the loss of a person, or a romantic love per se, but all that i had believed and lived for my entire life, especially during my years in prison, that love is the cure and the savior, the power and the might that overcomes everything against all odds; this belief that had helped me survive all obstacles, even the absurdity of my own survival, was now being crushed in front of me."
17153,executed,and then i realized that i had begun to feel somewhat envious of those friends of mine who had been executed.
17154,where,"i contemplated my own life now in the united states, where i had to begin everything anew from point zero."
17155,prisoner,"paradoxically, just three years before at the iranian women’s studies foundation conference, i had â�argued,  130  kobra  in â�response to a former political prisoner who used the metaphor of animals in a zoo to speak of our experience of imprisonment as being victims of the regime’s atrocities, that we were neither animals nor helpless victims but the subjects of our own will."
17156,disaster,"during the 2004 earthquake in the old cityâ€of bam in iran, for instance, i saw how my own experiences became constructive while i was working with the survivors of this heart-wrenching disaster."
17157,death,"to work through trauma means to live one’s life always in quest of meaning, to strive to create meaning for one’s life and, of course, death, without which there would be no meaning to life."
17158,executed,and then one day i surprised myself by telling one of my friends how lucky hamid was for having been executed.
17159,where,"how was i to live a life in which no sacrifice seemed possible, for everything seemed to be so easily purchased with money, where people changed their feelings faster than their shoes?"
17160,imprisoned,"for every other anniversary after the first year, until his execution, we were separated from one another, while both imprisoned."
17161,power,how consoled my soul would feel then.” was it the power of this incredible love that helped me through those tunnels of horror at the end of which i was still able to smile?
17162,disaster,"this is how you are, the shahla i knew, the one who smiles in the midst of disaster and laughs at pain."
17163,imprisonment,"you were always like that, and i loved you for it.” in 1983, ten months after our imprisonment, i was called for interrogation."
17164,torture,"while waiting to be sent into the room, i heard the guards and the interrogators whispering about hamid’s death under torture."
17165,ward,"that evening, in the ward, i looked through the bars to see the moon and the stars, seeking to find an empty hole in my heart in his absence."
17166,hole,"someone else felt that empty hole in her heart that day, as i did a few years later."
17167,death,"he was my angel who, instead of blinding me to death, unveiled the horizon for me through which i could face the gaze of death and the beauty of life simultaneously."
17168,law,"in the light of this love and this passion for life, we were able to discover the space between deaths and ways to reveal the criminality of the law to which we had been subjected."
17169,execution,"—hafiz, the green sea of heaven  e i was doing the dishes when i saw that lucid image of hamid’s execution."
17170,situation,i was in the dark about hamid’s situation.
17171,insane,"was i dreaming without knowing it, or had i gone insane and begun seeing images?"
17172,execution,"somehow it seemed so real, as though i were witnessing hamid’s execution while he was trying to reach me beyond the physical distance, perhaps to say goodbye."
17173,taken,"i had worn the ring since my wedding; during the last seven years, i had never taken it off my finger, and this was the first time it had been damaged."
17174,hole,"and finally i felt it; it was there, after all those games they played with me, but each time since i had not felt it; i somehow did not believe his loss, but now here it was, that hole in my heart."
17175,inside,but my heart was so filled with love and our shared experience that i felt him inside and tried to convince myself he was still alive.
17176,prisoner,"three years later, when i was released, i met a former male prisoner who was in the same ward with hamid at the time of the mass execution."
17177,taken,my knees gave way as i heard that the day hamid was taken was exactly the same day i had seen those images of him.
17178,death,"did he feel disappointed that i wasn’t responsive, or was he able to relate to my refusal to witness his death?"
17179,power,"i was physically far away from hamid, and i missed the power of his love that was breaking all the walls of time and space to reach me."
17180,death,yet the burden of the responsibility of living in accordance with the meaning of his life and death felt heavy on my shoulders.
17181,death,"was i, too, like roudabeh and others, seized by the gaze of death, by the image of his moment of dying, without being conscious of it?"
17182,insane,"she took the journey to the world of the insane, from which she had tried to stay so remote."
17183,prisoners,her conversion from islam to marxism made her perceived by both collaborators and the prison officials as even worse than those nonreligious prisoners whose families were not religious.
17184,imprisonment,"she was almost disowned by her family for becoming a leftist, and her imprisonment worsened this distance between her and her family."
17185,criminal,kobra was doubly criminal because of her personal background as a muslim who had become a leftist and her affiliation with an organization that had shifted its ideological position from islam to marxism.
17186,prisoners,"kobra was arrested in 1981, when the wards were extremely overcrowded and prisoners of different ages, organizations, and tendencies were squeezed into the same ward."
17187,ward,kobra  137  this deviance contributed to her seclusion in the ward.
17188,prisoners,"for resistant prisoners, the struggle against this isolation was a very challenging yet essential task."
17189,prisoners,"from 1981 to 1985, the collaborators were dominating prisons and creating an extremely unbearable situation for other prisoners by scrutinizing every move they made and reporting them to the interrogators, thus putting the prisoners under more severe torture and heavier sentences."
17190,prisoners,the regime’s brutality along with these difficult conditions in the wards led many of the prisoners toward a tactical retreat.
17191,prisoners,these prisoners would pretend that they had converted to islam and that they were no longer activists.
17192,power,"this tactical maneuver, in turn, intensified the collaborators’ power and perpetuated collaboration."
17193,ward,"in 1983, when i was arrested and sent to this ward, i was forced to live in a room in which everybody was either a collaborator or pretended to be one."
17194,prisoners,"at the time, among about five hundred prisoners, i was the second person in the entire ward who did not pray and took a direct stand against the regime."
17195,jail,this was harder on the mothers of young children in jail.
17196,ward,the ward to which i had been sent had twenty-eight children from infancy to seven years old.
17197,arrested,these were children who were either born in prison or arrested along with their mothers and had no one outside who could take care of them.
17198,jail,"in jail, too, i became very attached to them, and they also felt the bond."
17199,prisoners,"as time passed, those prisoners who had survived execution and madness, at least for the time being, learned more about themselves, their strengths, and new methods of resistance."
17200,prisoners,the antagonistic relationship between the adamant prisoners and the collaborators eventually led to increasing divergence among prisoners.
17201,prisoners,this encouraged the prison officials to begin their policy of segregating the resistant prisoners from the rest.
17202,prisoners,"as a result, the tension in the wards was relatively reduced, since the guards were unable to scrutinize the prisoners’ lives as closely as the collaborators did."
17203,prisoners,the prisoners were demanding better treatment while refusing to accept the regime’s imposing rules in prison and the conditions for their release.
17204,prisoners,"these actions, which often included hunger strikes, refusal to attend forced public recantations, or other occasions that mandated prisoners’ presence, were severely suppressed, and prisoners were often brutally punished."
17205,prisoners,the defeats and the extreme pressure that followed incited many prisoners toward less direct actions and opinions.
17206,prisoners,"after experiences like the dastgah in ghezel hesar, from which very few prisoners emerged as noncollaborators or sane individuals, it became even clearer that one’s resistance under torture in the early stages of one’s arrest did not necessarily guarantee its continuation under more extreme and prolonged conditions of hardship."
17207,inmates,among those who had given in and turned against their comrades after their experience in the â�dastgah were those whose resilience under torture at the time of their arrest  kobra  139  bought them great respect in the circle of their fellow inmates.
17208,prisoners,"this collaboration sometimes cost prisoners’ trust of one another, the lack of which influenced every aspect of their lives and relationships to one another."
17209,prisoners,"from 1984 until 1986, several movements by women prisoners were crushed, and many of the women agreed to the regime’s conditions to recant and be released."
17210,state,kobra was among those who chose to state her opinion directly whenever she was asked.
17211,situation,"as the government was establishing its technologies of power more solidly by suppressing nearly all the opposition groups outside and inside prison, her analysis of the situation was becoming more radicalized."
17212,prisoners,"she had a difficult time sleeping in a room with other prisoners, many of whom would speak, scream, or make other noises while asleep, especially during and after the summer of 1988."
17213,deprivation,"sleep deprivation, the prison’s constant pressure, and her failure to face reality pushed her further into withdrawing into herself."
17214,confinement,"after a fight with one of the guards, she was sent to solitary confinement, where she was deprived of her thyroid medication."
17215,confinement,"140  kobra  when kobra was returned to the ward, her abnormal behavior, which had begun while in solitary confinement, entertained the guards so much that they could not deprive themselves of the opportunity of watching our reaction to our first encounter with it."
17216,ward,"she was brought back to the ward a few days after the first group of women, who were being whipped during prayer times, returned."
17217,inmates,"staring at her fellow inmates, she cried out: “why aren’t you ready?"
17218,gate,"people are coming to open the prison gate, and you are sitting here so passively?” confused and surprised, we tried to calm her down, while the guards closed the door, taunting and laughing at her hysterically."
17219,imprisoned,"you are ignoring them, since you have been so afraid for so long that you prefer to stay passive and imprisoned."
17220,cell,"the guards, who had had enough of the show, took her back to her cell, beating her as they walked her away."
17221,inmates,"two months afterward, some of the inmates returned from their solitary cells, where they had heard kobra’s voice and the guards’ conversations about her."
17222,cell,she was constantly beaten and chained to the heater in her cell.
17223,where,"finally, she was driven to the point where her insanity was proved to prison officials, and she was hospitalized."
17224,imprisonment,"in 1989, when she was totally out of control, they delivered her to her family, who sent her to a mental hospital, from one type of imprisonment to another."
17225,prisoner,she had been given a job at a private company where a few other former inmates were also working for a previously leftist political prisoner under the shah’s regime.
17226,jail,"in between those periods of insanity, when others thought of her as normal, was the time for her to remember her episodes of madness while in jail."
17227,state,"our seemingly personal knowledge and habits are always shaped by overarching institutions such as family, religion, education, and the state."
17228,imprisonment,"ironically, this tendency became a driving force pushing her further from the mainstream and hence toward further imprisonment within the boundaries of these norms."
17229,insane,"her embarrassment grew, especially since she saw her fall in the eyes of those who had once deserted her but were now caring for her as an insane person."
17230,insane,every memory she gathered of her insane behavior in prison pushed her one more step toward her “ultimate fall from existence.” the mirror she had held in her mind was shattered when she saw how far she had wandered from her ideal image of herself.
17231,prisoners,"those of us who had known kobra’s  144  kobra  earlier attitude toward social and sexual propriety and heard of her behavior during her insanity, when she undressed in front of the guards and acted in sexually suggestive ways, taboo behavior among political prisoners, the enormity of her humiliation may be deciphered, and hence her suicide."
17232,death,"for kobra, from madness to death, the leap was too short."
17233,death,the connection between madness and death seems strange; they appear so close and related yet simultaneously detached from each other.
17234,death,could we argue that the reason an insane person does not commit suicide is the result of this very connection that exists between madness and death?
17235,insane,could it be true that an insane person is already separated from this physical world and hence unable to actively think about eliminating life?
17236,inmates,this question preoccupied me and other fellow inmates since often insanity seemed to have been cured only to lead to the person’s suicide.
17237,case,"whatever the reason, i never came across a case of someone in the throes of madness successfully committing suicide, while i could enumerate a list of those who were treated by professional therapists, only to take their own lives later."
17238,torture,yet she was a woman of strong determination who had survived severe torture and passed haji davoud’s tests in the dastgah and had not been defeated.
17239,prisoners,"however, like pori, she also gradually lost trust in other prisoners and joined those few prisoners who had gone through the â�dastgah; for she, too, had seen her friends’ betrayal, and her faith in others had faded away."
17240,prisoners,"most prisoners believed that it was sanaz who was ignoring marjan, and  kobra  145  that marjan was still pursuing her friendship without a positive response."
17241,war,"in the spring of 1988, the eight years of bloody war between iran and iraq ended."
17242,war,"the end of the war was immediately followed by an attack on iran’s southern border by the mojahedin, now based in and supported by iraq."
17243,prisoners,"while the attack brought nothing for the mojahedin but a humiliating defeat, for the islamic republic it provided an excuse and opportunity to solve the persistent problem of political prisoners, an opportunity that the iranian government had impatiently anticipated."
17244,prisoners,he was referring to the execution of thousands of prisoners following the attack.
17245,prisoners,"for the islamic republic, political prisoners were the embodiment of a complex dilemma, since their very existence was a challenge to the totalized divine system the regime claimed to represent."
17246,prisoners,"yet neither infliction of pain on prisoners’ bodies nor theological persuasion was effective in returning some prisoners’ souls to god, which for the regime really meant to acquire support for the islamic republic."
17247,prisoners,"the majority of prisoners who were affiliated with the mojahedin organization were immediately called from the wards, summarily tried, and executed in large groups."
17248,prisoners,"regimes of torture were intensified against the rest of us, assuring either acquiescence or execution for the vast majority of iran’s remaining  146  kobra  population of political prisoners."
17249,executed,they then moved to leftist men and tried and executed many of them.
17250,execution,"as we learned later, apparently the disagreements between khomeini and montazeri led to changing the plans about leftist women’s execution."
17251,sentence,"instead, they began calling women in small groups and trying them together in trials of no more than a few minutes’ duration, except that the sentence was to be whipped five times a day, five lashes each time, until the person agreed to profess her faith in islam and agreed to pray."
17252,death,the choice was either to be whipped till death or agree to pray.
17253,court,"as the prisoners were ushered into court in random sequence, each of us had to contemplate the consequences of our individual and collective decision to convert or to embrace death."
17254,death,"how, as political beings, could we use both our biological existence and our pending death to our advantage?"
17255,prisoner,"a fellow prisoner, monireh baradarn, who initially wrote under the pen name m. raha, poses the following questions in regard to marjan: “had she believed the horrifying events that we could not get ourselves to believe?"
17256,ward,"repeatedly, she ran to the ward’s gate to see whether her name had been called."
17257,torture,"after a while, she became nearly obsessed, perhaps not so much with the fear of death than with the horror of torture."
17258,torture,"every noise, object, and space hinted at the possibility of imminent torture and hence augmented her torment."
17259,ward,she heard the strikes of the lashes in the sound of the pots in which food was carried to the ward.
17260,jail,"in the opening of the gate to the yard, one of the few pleasurable sounds in jail, marjan’s ears heard the echo of gunfire that killed prisoners."
17261,taken,her existence had been taken over by the presence of dreadful ghosts.
17262,prisoner,"she became a prisoner of horror; she stood at the door all day long, with her ear attached to it, and anxiously awaited her turn to be taken as the next prey of the lashes."
17263,sentences,"our screams, moans, and fragmented sentences disrupted our sleeping hours."
17264,prisoners,many of the prisoners were unsuccessful in this effort and either submitted to the regime’s conditions or slipped into the worlds of madness or death.
17265,charge,"every night, for two hours, each of us was in charge of looking after her."
17266,death,yet at that moment all we thought about was saving her from death.
17267,death,"we felt obliged to preventâ€her death, despite the pain that this effort inevitably brought about."
17268,wall,"we would chase her to the bathroom stall where we would climb up the wall of the next stall to watch her, so committed we were to our job of rescue."
17269,toilet,"she was on the floor of the toilet, pale and still with her eyes colored by fright."
17270,torture,"in my dreams, i wonder if she is upset that we did not try harder to convince her that the torture was not going to last forever, that we had to hold on to hope in order to survive?"
17271,freedom,"what was our task: to prolong her misery, to let her exercise her freedom, or to try to integrate her into our normalized yet extreme order?"
17272,power,"5  innocent cruelty yousuf  the government of men by men—whether they form small or large groups, whether it is power exerted by men over women, or by adults over children, or by one class over another, or by a bureaucracy over a population— involves a certain type of rationality."
17273,power,"consequently, those who resist or rebel against a form of power cannot merely be content to denounce violence or criticize an institution."
17274,question,the question is: how are such relations rationalized.
17275,inside,his presence animated the evil inside them.
17276,power,"not merely an outlet for the frustration that was accumulated in them from the past, yousuf also presented them with the temptation to exercise the  yousuf  153  power they were lacking in so many respects in their current lives."
17277,power,"in exaggerating yousuf’s weakness, they took pride in their own comparatively manly power."
17278,building,"these men, who had all migrated from the same village as yousuf’s, were construction workers, building luxurious houses in the rich neighborhoods in the north of tehran where pretty, half-naked women were playing around in their swimming pools."
17279,where,"after work, the men went back to their room where the rotten smell would have given them headaches, if their sensitivity had remained intact."
17280,where,"his abnormality, both physical and mental, was quite mild when he was in the village, where his deviance from the norm was nearly unnoticed or ignored."
17281,where,"however, in the crowded, alienating city of tehran, where everything moved and changed so rapidly and where people’s integration into its gigantic yet extremely constricted urban boundaries was so complex, yousuf’s “tame” character made his exclusion from this community almost inevitable."
17282,where,"the paradox lay in the particulars of where and when he was raised, and ironically in the mildness of his abnormality."
17283,building,he was lying down in the large meadow in his village watching the white clouds building their beautiful castles.
17284,where,yousuf was awakened and pulled back to this world of speed and complexity where he was struggling to establish his footing.
17285,power,"let the river wash its evil power away,” my mother had advised."
17286,where,"she nevertheless had tried to convince my father not to go to work, but he teased her and left to do his job at the railroad where he attached the train cars to one another."
17287,power,"he, however, denied it, for in his view, dreams did not have the power to foretell one’s future."
17288,where,ganly goul was where two rivers in our village branched off.
17289,stretch,"while the rivers stretch out their arms to bear life, their nefarious mouth swallows young couples."
17290,death,"violence, death, and love spurt through them and into the whole village so that whatever people eat has the flavors of love, creation, and destruction."
17291,death,"as in the rivers, and in the villagers’ bodies, life and death, love and hatred, and creation and desolation cohabit."
17292,power,is it the power of all these disastrous qualities offered to the rivers that provokes their evil powers?
17293,arrest,"e almost seventy-two hours after my arrest, i finally fall asleep while my feet and my body are in unbearable pain."
17294,cell,"yousuf  161  they have finally brought a wheelchair to take me to the interrogation, but in the cell i have to manage to move without it."
17295,torture,"i am not sure, for in iranian prisons (unlike abu ghraib or guantanomo) dogs were not included among the torture techniques."
17296,jail,"but i am now in jail, and in the world of dreams, where everything is possible."
17297,disaster,"however, i do not recall asking myself why we did not recognize that the ashes of destruction and disaster would be coming back to us through the river that ran through our land, and therefore into whatever  162  yousuf  we saw, ate, and drank."
17298,cell,"it is hot, and the light in the small cell is hurting my eyes."
17299,where,where is the sun of my dream?
17300,prisoners,"escape from prison, which in reality is so incredibly unlikely, constantly emanates in prisoners’ dreams, especially while under torture."
17301,state,dreams and imagination create a state of being and experiencing that makes the impossible the subject of everyday occurrence.
17302,prisoners,they are essential elements that help prisoners survive the dread of torture.
17303,prisoner,"what seems clear to me, however, is that when hope vanishes, for a prisoner left with a ravished body and soul, it vanishes both from her dreams and reality."
17304,death,"gulping the water, frozen and paralyzed, he stared at death spreading over him."
17305,death,"when they took him out, forced him to throw up in order to be able to breathe, and helped him to walk home, yousuf walked mechanically and mindlessly and in the absolute silence of death."
17306,death,he now possessed the powers of death and madness.
17307,taken,"the evils of the river had taken him over, enacting themselves through him."
17308,arrested,"i was arrested during this phase of his enforced calmness in which he remained for a while, but he never resumed that sense of normalcy that his family desired to see in him."
17309,imprisonment,"during those nearly two years of my imprisonment, my family’s remarks were limited to some general comments about his situation: “he is calm and back in the village."
17310,prisoners,the way that everyone seems to have played a part in drawing yousuf to his final destination reminds me of the massacre of political prisoners in the summer of 1988.
17311,prisoners,the prison officials pursued a policy of having everyone’s hands in the system covered with prisoners’ blood.
17312,crime,"this collective involvement of all the prison personnel in the process of torture, execution, and getting rid of their dead bodies was rationalized as a safety valve for those who were the main agents of this crime."
17313,crime,"it was to keep everyone silent about the massacre, for if they spoke, the secret of their own role in the crime would be revealed."
17314,prisoners,"we overheard this from the guards, who were talking about a time when one of them had tried to get out of the task of shooting prisoners or carrying their corpses, and the response from the higher-ranking officers had been that nobody’s hands were to remain clean."
17315,prisoners,"with censorship lifted from the newspapers, we learned that the release of political prisoners was a central slogan of the demonstrations."
17316,prisoners,"then came that evening in 1978, only three months before the revolution, when my name was announced along with those of a majority of other prisoners, on the list of those to be released."
17317,question,the waves of the revolutionary movement were too strong and influential to allow my parents to question my decision to join the demonstration.
17318,taken,"but contrary to dervishes’ voluntary relocation, yousuf was taken to these places without his consent."
17319,where,"his parents were under pressure both financially and emotionally since in a small village where everyone knew one another, his madness was well known and spoken about by all the villagers."
17320,death,"was he annoyed that they gazed at him without communicating anything to him but coldness, silence, and death?"
17321,taken,"there was, however, a childish manner in him that reminded me of him before he had taken this journey to the other territory."
17322,where,"being left alone in the house for a short period, they went to the basement, where they noticed that several pigeons in their cages were scratching themselves, or so the parents believed."
17323,where,"we spent a couple of hours together, during which he asked me where i had been."
17324,prison ,he could not refuse doing what i had asked him since i had come from prison —how much this annoyed me!
17325,inside,i envisioned him shaking inside but afraid of being considered less of a man if he refused to join others to mock and humiliate him.
17326,torture,i felt ashamed for even comparing their innocent games to torture.
17327,torture,how frightening and disheartening it is to be able to trace torture in such ordinary contexts and situations.
17328,prisoners,it was frightening for me to admit how yousuf’s experience in being dropped from the bridge and his loss of sanity in the face of death resembled the experiences of many prisoners who were taken for faked executions.
17329,power,"your chador, or even your hair under it, could be burned by the bullet, you could even get a shallow scar, but it would be only a game for them, a game of power to break you down under such intense pressure."
17330,where,"while blindfolded, you would never know where, when, or if they were shooting."
17331,where,"e when we were in elementary school in a very small town in azarbaijan and were punished for being late in the morning, we knew when and where our principal would hit."
17332,question,he never bothered to question why we were late.
17333,awaiting,"we would stand in a line among others who had come late or had not worn their white collar, part of our school uniform, awaiting our turn to be beaten, while watching others’ hands turning red and swollen."
17334,punishment,"one day, my sister, who was only in the first grade, could not hold her hands still, and her punishment began increasing."
17335,torture,"my little sister’s frightened eyes, and her hands that pulled away any time the ruler moved toward them, were replicated in roya’s effort to escape her ceaseless fear of torture."
17336,punishment,"picturing all these scenes of “innocent” cruelty and institutionalized, systematic punishment and torture testifies to how deeply rooted violence is embedded in our societies and in the history of humanity."
17337,torture,"as in the case of ordinary violence, the language of torture might differ from one context to another, but its prevalence is astonishing."
17338,torture,torture and its technologies are shared and exchanged on a global scale.
17339,torture,"the uniqueness of torture, however, can be traced and examined in the cultural, social, and political settings in which it is deployed."
17340,arrested,174  yousuf  i was a first - year u ni v ersity st u dent  when i was arrested by  savak during the shah’s regime.
17341,torture,"protecting the well-being and the rights of its citizens was a goal trumpeted by the state, and torture was perceived as a means to accomplish this end."
17342,arrested,i was reported as a potential dissident and was therefore arrested.
17343,torture,i watched my interrogators addressing one another as “doctor” and talking about torture as a necessary surgery that removes the infected parts from the body.
17344,prisoner,getting information from a prisoner was likened to the procedure of removing a tumor from a person’s body.
17345,torture,"these torturers were experts, trained in the best schools of torture to perform a precise, calculated, and spiritless implementation of their tasks."
17346,torture,"in the torture rooms, or as they called them, “laboratories,” advanced technologies of torture were tested."
17347,cell,"i still sweat, recalling the look on my father’s face when my interrogator told him that he had been watching me sleep half naked in my cell."
17348,torture,this was the paradox of torture  yousuf  175  and interrogation; it interfered with and penetrated into the most intimate and personal aspects of a person’s life while remaining extremely impersonal in its nature.
17349,tortured,"under the shah, the tortured were the torturers’ subjects in their laboratories."
17350,arrested,"when i was arrested for the second time, it was under the regime of the islamic republic, which claimed a radical shift from the westernized regime of the shah to the early islamic governance where the ruling class was supposed to be also a religious guide for people, who were called ommat, the community of muslims."
17351,evin,"as agents of the secret police, our captors who drove hamid and me to evin prison addressed one another as brothers."
17352,punishment,"those who rebelled against this community were either infidels, thus outside the community, or disobedient children whose required punishment was to return them to the right path or to eliminate them to preserve the unity of the family of islam."
17353,where,"i recall that about a year or so after the 1979 revolution, a young man where i worked expressed his romantic feelings for me and asked me to marry him, while calling me sister."
17354,prisoners,"the voices of those prisoners who, while under torture, would beg the brothers to stop the beatings cried out the paradox of this strange, superficial relation between the torture and the language used by the torturer."
17355,punishment,"on the other hand, it covered up the impersonal and brutal nature of torture under the guise of mere punishment by the parent or older siblings to discipline disobedient children."
17356,torture,"indescribable agony seized me as i sat in the wheelchair right after torture, facing a written form on which i was asked if i believed that â�torture  176  yousuf  existed under the islamic republic."
17357,question,the question made me so furious that any response to it seemed humiliating.
17358,question,the experience of answering yes to this nonsensical question and being beaten again did little to reduce the bitterness i felt at being forced into such an ironic position.
17359,prisoners,"from the first day, a battle began between those prisoners who resisted addressing the prison officials and the interrogators as their sisters and brothers and the prison officials who fought to force them to utter these words, while they called prisoners names and dirty words, making their reference to them in familial terms even more bizarre."
17360,punishment,"the pain inflicted on prisoners was not torture, but tazir or hadd, islamic terms for regulatory punishment."
17361,power,"the fight extended even to our everyday language where the prison officials would insist on referring to our daily chores in prison as “housekeeping” in opposition to our term, “labor.” none of these contradictions, despite their intentions, could obscure the power struggle that lay beneath them."
17362,torture,"under the islamic republic, however, guards avoided even touching our hands, as a principle, though during torture, all these rules were thrown out the window."
17363,stir,that men could  yousuf  177  be with several women did not stir up their blood as much as the idea of women being involved with more than one man.
17364,torture,"this was the common language and practice with which the torture spoke itself and was performed, a language of power, humiliation, and domination."
17365,power,"the labyrinths of these power struggles, which were so systematically manifested in relation to prison, also wove their webs through every stitch of the social fabric."
17366,power,y o u s u f ’ s e x perience  was one illustration of these interwoven power  games.
17367,death,"i, too, had journeyed through the realms of violence, despair, fear, and pain where i had come so close to madness and death that my blood was frozen in my veins."
17368,death,"my parents, however, were worried that i was exhausting myself by the demonstrations, where i faced gunfire and death, and by trying to understand yousuf beyond or through his world of madness."
17369,imprisoned,"everybody was convinced that he would benefit from being sent back to his home where he could be relatively free, since in tehran he was nearly imprisoned."
17370,imprisoned,"my parents felt it was unfair, for “why should they always take the responsibility for every member of the family?” my father complained that when i was imprisoned, he was not even able to share with his family his horrifying experiences of having his young daughter in such an awful place."
17371,guilty,"he blamed my cousin for his irresponsibility in breaking his promise to take yousuf to the village, while my cousin was convinced that in fact the guilty one was the bus driver who had promised to watch him but had failed to do so."
17372,guilt,did they ever unconsciously wish for his death to relieve them of their guilt over him and his travails?
17373,jail,"in 1999, when i initially began to write about jail, with no intention to write about him, or without having even thought about him, his seemingly forgotten story struck me in a dream, in one as invisible and as insignificant as his place in my life seemed to be."
17374,insane,"my cousin paid the driver to deliver yousuf, for he did not want to waste time and his peace of mind to go all the way to the village with an insane person."
17375,authorities,"like my cousin, this yousuf, too, is considered as other to the society, for his leftist views that the mother finds at odds with the ideas of the authorities and the majority of iranians at the time."
17376,power,"night after night, the government-run television and radio asked mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters to turn in the deviant members of their families to government agents, for the love of god, islam, khomeini, and the islamic republic, all collapsing into one another to mean the new regime in power."
17377,execution,"the rumor was spread that she had been promised that her son would only be punished, not killed; hence after learning of his execution, she lost the capacity to live with her guilt of betraying her own son and with the grief."
17378,case,"in the case of my cousin, nobody learned what happened to him."
17379,death,"did he walk toward soldiers in a demonstration without realizing it was toward death that he was walking, for he had already been captured by death through madness?"
17380,death,"did he starve to death or die from lack of water, as had imam hussein, the third imam of shi‘i muslims who in 681 was killed by yazid, the caliph, along with seventy-two of his companions because the enemy had deprived them of water, for whose thirst and death yousuf used to cry so sincerely?"
17381,executed,i used to ask myself similar questions about hamid: was he really executed?
17382,imprisoned,"6  maryam a god who cried  listen to the song of the reed, how it wails with the pain of separation: “ever since i was taken from my reed bed my woeful song has caused men and women to weep.” —rumi, in the arms of the beloved  it was one of those hot summer afternoons in ghezel hesar in 1985, when even the air seemed imprisoned."
17383,prisoners,the prisoners lacked the energy even to wipe away their sweat.
17384,situation,"conversation, which in a normal situation might shorten the day, was abandoned."
17385,state,"in the humid cells, as we lay motionless, in a state between sleep and unconsciousness, time and space escaped their normal frame of existence and reference."
17386,evin,"i remembered that, while in evin prison in 1983–84, we used to laugh at one of the regime’s ideologues who insisted on proving that being a devout muslim does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of believing in a scientific explanation of the cosmos, assuming his opponents suggested it did."
17387,stretch,"to illustrate, he explained that the reason the people in the south of iran sleep in large beds is that the weather is hot there, so they need 185  186  maryam  to stretch out."
17388,where,"in the northwest of iran, where he was from, people used smaller mattresses since it was cold and they automatically cpmpressed themselves to stay warm; hence, they do not need large beds."
17389,stretch,"a wish vaguely crossed my mind, only on the surface, as light passes through thick fog: how wonderful it would have been if we in fact had more space to really be able to stretch out."
17390,state,"in that hallucinatory state, this tall, thin young woman with her short, dark hair, in her white shirt and black pants, looked more like a young man than a woman."
17391,state,her performance was so incredibly magnificent that we were torn from our illusory state.
17392,possession,"a form of possession, an artistic act, or just sheer  maryam  187  madness—whatever it was totally baffled us."
17393,imprisoned,"a hardworking but poor man with a sick wife and eight children, he was struggling for his family’s survival and worried about his oldest daughter, maryam, who was imprisoned."
17394,where,"she was still in a different time frame, in her past, but exactly when and where were not yet clear."
17395,where,"she began with fragmented episodes of her life in her high school, in an art class where she was a stage actor."
17396,interrogation,she was taken to the interrogation and .
17397,freed,"in the brief intervals of biting her hands, she freed her scream, which was growing harsher and lower."
17398,ward,the whole ward was silenced and dismayed.
17399,torture,"waking up, she had found herself naked, covered in her blood, still tied up to the torture bed with an aching body."
17400,rape,"although she spoke in her own voice, and sometimes even used the pronoun i, the way in which she was telling her story after the rape and her crying seemed as though it had happened to another person, or to the person who had died within her that day, after the rape."
17401,cell,"we found out that maryam was left in the room for three days, which was something she had later learned through a woman guard who came to take her to her cell."
17402,ordered,"as soon as the guard had touched her body, she had begun to remember everything, but the guard had slapped her on the face and ordered her to stay silent about it."
17403,inmates,"one of my fellow inmates remembered hearing her after these events, screaming for days and nights and finally speaking nonsense."
17404,cell,"she had now recognized the woman beside her cell, who in her frenzied speeches had talked about her interrogator raping her."
17405,cell,"the guards had chained her in her cell, covering her mouth except at mealtime."
17406,ward,the whole ward was disrupted by the noise of this thunder that the angry god was provoking.
17407,ward,"so, when the head of the ward, a collaborator, homa kalhor, came in and tried to forceably take god down, we were still astounded by maryam’s fascinating talent and creativity in generating such powerful scenes one after another."
17408,ward,we had all forgotten about the heat and the trivialities of the ward.
17409,cell,"we watched this beaten, defeated god, who finally cried and escaped to the corner of the cell, where she was followed and beaten again."
17410,ward,"while dragged on the floor outside the ward, her bleeding head and leg left a trace of blood behind, the only sign of that crazy god who cried on that hellish day."
17411,inmates,"we learned from one of our fellow inmates, who used to live in the same neighborhood with her, that maryam was a very intelligent person and a good student."
17412,insane,"for those of us who had seen  190  maryam  maryam as merely an insane person and did not have any interaction with her prior to that day, the evening of this theatrical madness raised a lot of questions."
17413,arrested,"for instance, i wondered why she would let moses instead of mohammad speak through her, when she was a muslim (she was arrested for her affiliation with mojahedin)."
17414,where,is there a specific space where the realm of art ends and we enter the world of madness?
17415,where,where does one draw the line between imagination and phantasm?
17416,where,"living in prison, in the world of deprivation and absences, necessitates that one live beyond the images and objects, or rather in the world enriched by one’s imagination where desirable objects are created in their recognized absence."
17417,power,"it requires an ability to consume images, reshape them, destroy them, and live without them, with the power to create a world without any material grounding."
17418,death,the art of living in prison becomes possible through imagining life in the very presence of death and observing death in the very existence of life.
17419,death,it is embracing and flying on the wings of death as though it is the bird of freedom.
17420,arrested,"—rumi, in the arms of the beloved  after months of living furtively, since the beginning of a wave of crackdowns on all dissidents in the summer of 1981, bleeding in our hearts  maryam  191  from the news of our close friends’ executions, saying good-bye to our beloved ones every morning as if for the last time, and awaiting our turn, finally one evening in the spring of 1983, there came a knock on our door, and hamid and i were arrested in a small rental apartment in a poor neighborhood of tehran and were driven to evin, a notorious prison."
17421,torture,"yet before i was taken to the torture room, in between the slaps on my face and the kicks on my legs, in between those breaths of fright and uncertainty during which my heart experienced extreme sensations from pounding as fast as african drums to total breathlessness, i had time to think (did i really think?)."
17422,death,"time stopped, and i felt death’s ghost flying over my head."
17423,torture,"our resistance, in refusing to submit to the torturers’ desire to break us, overturns, or at least restrains, torture’s absolute destruction."
17424,injustice,"through our resistance, we enliven the struggle against the normalization of injustice, humiliation, and the attack on dignity and the enslavement of our minds and bodies."
17425,cell,i opened my eyes in a small cell.
17426,toilet,"a toilet and a sink in a corner bound me to that place, and i wondered for how long."
17427,interrogation,it was only a small opening in the metal door that connected me to a narrow hall and to the guards; the door was never opened to me unless i was called for interrogation.
17428,prisoners,"although separated from other prisoners, i knew that many others were locked in their cells trying to fathom the meaning of what had happened to them and ways to cope with it, as i was."
17429,prisoners,"on the wall, the prisoners before me had carved their names and inscribed some dates long past."
17430,cell,"maryam  193  blowing your soul into your fingers forced to live in a place where only four steps take you to the other side of the cell, your eyes hungrily swallow the faint light that passes through the bars and plays hide and seek with you on the wall."
17431,imprisoned,your imagination is what you possess and cannot be easily imprisoned; it is your territory of freedom and an essential element that keeps you from drowning in an impossible situation.
17432,cell,"lying on imagined clouds, you take off from your small, bizarre cell to the heart of the sky, where you are able to see children still playing, laughing, and growing."
17433,power,"after all, what is supernatural power if not the ability to live and love, surpassing the horror of death, hatred, and despair?"
17434,cell,"like the prisoners in plato’s allegorical cave, you are compelled to live in your cavelike cell where the outside world seems so removed and illusory."
17435,torture,"you announce a hunger strike for which you go under another phase of torture, and you become a creator by using your hands and your fingers as vehicles by which your mind takes the imagined journey to the outside world."
17436,situation,"through them, you learn about your capacities in spite of the limitations of your situation."
17437,torture,"you become alive by giving birth to these  194  maryam  inanimate objects, while the language and the voice that torture aims to eliminate continue in them."
17438,prisoners,"this is how prisoners become artists and the art in prison comes into existence, not so much for its aesthetic quality but for its existential purpose."
17439,cell,"e after four days of torture, finally hamid was taken to his cell."
17440,torture,it was the first night out of the torture room.
17441,arrest,"the evening before his arrest, we had gone to our favorite park, where after a long hike, holding hands, we sat by the river and listened to its music."
17442,torture,"the day after, even before dark, we were in the torture room."
17443,cell,"—rumi, in the arms of the beloved  alone in his cell, hamid had announced a dry hunger strike that deprived him of prisoners’ usual pleasure of spending time eating or even drinking tea and water."
17444,arrest,"with his broken body and his torn clothes, his memories and his socks, which had remained untouched since his arrest, for he could not put them on those injured, swollen feet, were the only possessions left for him from the outside world."
17445,where,"my feet might not walk again, but i make these socks walk for me where my heart wants to be.” in our first meeting, after a year, when hamid sneaked in the wallet he had sewn for me out of his socks, he explained to me how he had taken them apart with his injured hands, twisted the threads together, and knitted a wallet for me with no access to any tool."
17446,prisoners,"for most prisoners, the period under intense torture is rarely the time for creation."
17447,confinement,they basically strive to imagine freedom and life beyond their solitary confinement.
17448,power,an enormous power is required to concentrate on making something while pain is so intense.
17449,state,"however, a person who achieves this state of living beyond pain gains a remarkable capacity to alter extreme suffering."
17450,torture,"through this creation, one not only communicates with others but also articulates phenomena that are essentially in negation of all that torture seeks to destroy: love, resilience, passion for life, and creativity."
17451,torture,"the same body that under torture seems one’s enemy, in the process of creating, returns to us and helps us feel ourselves again."
17452,prisoners,"—foucault, “on the genealogy of ethics”  it is the art of living and the power of resistance in an inhumane situation that gives birth to the delicate handicrafts produced by prisoners."
17453,prisoners,"locked up in their small cells, unable to move their injured feet, prisoners preserve their soul through nourishing their creativity, against the ravages of time and death."
17454,prisoners,"in the world of isolation and forbidden love, loved ones become the source of imaginative power for prisoners."
17455,prisoners,"prisoners engrave their names on such things as pebbles, coins, or woven wallets."
17456,prisoner,"the work of art in prison signifies the prisoner’s refusal to become a totalized, faceless cipher among others."
17457,prisoners,"in their struggle against submission, prisoners employ and reshape objects that cry out their resistance to becoming imprisoned souls and slaves of imposed identities."
17458,prisoners,"the possibility of a departure is embedded in the labor, desire, and imagination invested in producing this art, which creates life in the midst of the prisoners’ deadly situation."
17459,prisoners,maryam  197  it is also for this very reason that some of the most intense battles between prison officials and prisoners were over the making of artwork.
17460,prisoners,endless rules were announced to forbid the production of anything that expressed prisoners’ creativity and artistic experiences.
17461,prisoner,"it was not merely the content of the art, but far more important perhaps, the very basic desire of the prisoner for making the art that these rules targeted."
17462,prisoners,"the argument was that by occupying themselves with these trivial things, prisoners were avoiding reflection on their past and therefore continued their enmity toward the regime."
17463,prisoners,"guards’ and collaborators’ scrutinizing eyes were present in every corner of the wards to catch prisoners while working on a little pebble, a bone, or a seed found in the meal, or other objects through which their creativity could materialize itself."
17464,prisoners,"in response to our constant complaints about not delivering our letters to our families, the prison’s director responded, “you are prisoners, supposed to be isolated from your normal life."
17465,prisoners,"certain prisoners were distinguished for their highly stylized and skilled letters, developing aesthetic forms while achieving the main goal of crossing the barriers of communication."
17466,execution,"—vera schwarcz, “the pane of sorrow”  the trees were upside down as i stared at the mirrorlike glass window of the meeting room when my father said, “they gave us a number, number fifteen, and told us to come back tomorrow to get news about your husband.” this meant that they were announcing his execution and delivering his meager possessions."
17467,ward,"silently therefore, i walked toward the ward as snow was washing my fiery face."
17468,law,"for three nights, i stayed awake and thought of writing a letter to my brother-in-law."
17469,ward,those seven lines wept my experience while i was able to walk in the ward without tears in my eyes.
17470,law,"to do so, i had to depart from myself, to think about my brother-in-law and his pain."
17471,death,"in convincing him of the  200  maryam  meaningfulness of hamid’s death, i was also convincing myself."
17472,death,"that was how i gave birth to a new self and survived the most horrifying death, dying inside."
17473,prisoners,prisoners who accomplish the goal of living through this hell and surviving with their integrity not radically damaged are creators of the art that is simply their lives.
17474,prisoners,committing suicide can be—not only physically but spiritually—the most inviting drive for prisoners.
17475,inmates,one of the most terrifying experiences in prison is to constantly encounter inmates who are seemingly alive yet utterly detached from life.
17476,prisoners,"these are prisoners who never attempt to bend the bars in order to have a glimpse of the sky, stars, or anything that belongs to the outside world."
17477,prisoners,it is the horror of realizing the danger of dying inside that urges resistant prisoners to hold on to whatever protects them from such a death.
17478,prisoners,being capable of laughter is one of those ropes that link these prisoners to life.
17479,prisoners,the art of creating laughter laughter was an essential element in prisoners’ lives.
17480,prisoners,“it was the victory of laughter over fear” that impressed these resisting political prisoners the most.
17481,prisoners,prisoners would talk about their fear of torture in such a comic way that it would put them at ease to laugh about it.
17482,torture,"as we focused on the irrationality of torture and the torturer, ridiculing our own fear and their worries, the boundaries of the rational and irrational collapsed."
17483,authorities,our jokes would target both the authorities and ourselves.
17484,situation,"through these humorous comments, both in our daily conversations and in satiric plays, we criticized ourselves and, though briefly, stepped out of our situation."
17485,prisoners,prisoners had to confront the alienation and the estrangement toward one another that the authorities were so vigorously trying to generate and reinforce by different tactics.
17486,prisoners,"the prison’s officials and the guards reported any close relationship between prisoners, separating them from one another or employing methods that used one against the other."
17487,prisoners,prisoners could not share their belongings with one another since sharing was considered a symptom of communist sympathies.
17488,punishment,"on many occasions, prisoners’ refusal to watch their friends being tortured led to their collective resistance and, consequently, collective punishment and torture."
17489,arrested,"the essential element of the art of living in prison was to be able to preserve compassion, care for one’s self and others in the world in which, in the words of shamlu, my favorite iranian poet, “they whip love on the obstructed road.”  bahar’s birthday in 1981, bahar was fifteen days old when she was arrested with her mother."
17490,prisoners,"on her second birthday, more than eighty prisoners in her room decided to celebrate the occasion."
17491,prisoners,some prisoners made the clothes while others did the embroidery.
17492,prisoner,"farangis, a seventeen-year-old prisoner who was arrested when she was fourteen and is now a painter, had prepared  202  maryam  a notebook in which she had painted pictures of animals, flowers, and trees that bahar had never seen in her life."
17493,prisoners,some of the prisoners excelled in decorating the stage by using simple materials.
17494,case,this was the case both in this regime and under the shah.
17495,ward,i still joyously recall a time in the new year of 1978 when the chief of qasr prison came to visit our ward and was astounded by our stage decoration.
17496,prisoners,"he could not believe that the furnished living room created by prisoners for our play about the life of an urban middle-class couple was made entirely from newspapers, plastic, and fabrics, dyed with pills or skillfully embroidered."
17497,prisoner,"in prison, everything from a peach pit to a bone to an empty can was considered precious, since these objects became the means by which the prisoner, the artist, communicated and created a new life."
17498,interrogation,"on our fewminute trips to the meeting rooms, on our way to the clinic or to interrogation, we highly cherished every chance we could get to grab some soil or anything that might be useful for our artwork."
17499,ward,we would conceal these under our chadors until we got to the ward.
17500,prisoners,mouloud was one of the prisoners who planted the morning glories in the yard in such designs that they could convey her feelings and ideas.
17501,death,"with their beauty, vitality, and color they were full of the force of life and even death."
17502,prisoner,"niko, another prisoner and a painter, would use the flowers and leaves to make color for her paintings."
17503,prisoners,"dates were almost the only supplemental source of energy, and prisoners treasured them whenever they were given the chance to buy them."
17504,prisoners,"the prisoners would wash the seeds, put them in some kind of container, and add hot water."
17505,prisoners,"after a few days, the prisoners would take the seeds out and rub them on any hard surface, such as the asphalt ground in the yard or a stone found either in the yard or in one of those trips out of the ward."
17506,death,"i n the winter o f 1 9 7 8 ,  just a few days before the iranian new year,  in qasr prison in tehran we were attacked by a death squad, the special prison guards of the shah’s regime."
17507,inmates,we informed our families by sending two of our fellow inmates to family visit while the rest of us also announced a strike on family visits.
17508,ward,"that same day we were taken, though temporarily, to a different ward where through its window we could see the sky."
17509,death,"that dawn remained in my memory, awash in gorgeous shades—a memory that allowed me to face death, promise to myself that no mat-  maryam  205  ter when, where, or how i die, i would live every day of my life “as if it were the last.” whenever my heart ached with loneliness, i remembered hamid and my other loved ones, like that sunrise, and i felt alive again."
17510,imprisonment,"the destructive impact of an experience as traumatic as imprisonment, especially under such conditions as the prisons of the regimes of the shah and the islamic republic, extends beyond the thick walls surrounding prison."
17511,prisoners,"the incessant pressure that prisoners experience, the ceaseless fright of impending torture and execution, drains the energy necessary to face the changes."
17512,prisoner,"these qualities, in turn, induce an attitude of conformity toward the very social norms against which a former political prisoner has been fighting."
17513,prisoner,learning how to refuse the tendency to remain imprisoned within the boundaries  206  maryam  of an immutable self is as imperative for the resistant prisoner as the refusal to submit to authorities.
17514,prisoners,"the loss of motivation to challenge oneself out of entrapment within oneself and failing to seek new ways of thinking and being are potent dangers that prisoners face even, or in fact more, after they leave prison."
17515,imprisonment,"when i initially began to write this text in 1999, i realized that my memories of my imprisonment were particularly triggered by my experiences in a new country, the united states, where i had simultaneously found myself a stranger yet at home, for it was here that i had once again fallen in love and lost my love."
17516,state,the failure had pushed me into a state of despair.
17517,death,"i had nearly forsaken the very basic principle of a creative life, to make the remaking of myself the task and the goal of my life in the face of death, and to be present to death and remember the dead."
17518,execution,every morning began with our anticipation of another group’s being called for execution or for whipping.
17519,power,"i was, however, caught by a strange power that i had attributed to these words."
17520,power,"i had even mentioned in my writing that he might never get the chance to read it, but scared of the power of the words, i avoided using words such as dead or executed."
17521,execution,"after i learned about his execution, i felt that the horizon of my imagination was diminished."
17522,jail,"and what about all those beautiful experiences i lived in jail, those joyous moments of the victory of love, resilience, and friendship over the dark forces of torture, violence, and hatred?"
17523,war,"i returned to my story, also in a different site, as marguerite duras has the protagonist of her movie hiroshima mon amour, a frenchwoman, tell the story of her traumatic loss of her german lover during world warâ€ii in hiroshima, the site of another trauma."
17524,racism,"i came to tell my story in the united states, a place with its own history of violence and suffering, from the earlier genocide of native americans, to the enslavement of african americans, racism, its wars on other countries, and an increasing divide between its haves and have-nots."
17525,where,"i had left the country in which my voice was violently silenced, where many of my beloved ones’ lives were taken from them simply over one word, no."
17526,where,"while in prison, where i could sacrifice my life and body over the words i consumed, i had fought against this silence."
17527,freedom,"it was there i had learned how to see and feel the spirit of the change in the air so that i could join and swim with others on the tide toward the ocean of freedom, even though it turned out to be so extremely short lived and fleeting."
17528,where,i felt mute where so much conversation was going on.
17529,where,"however, when i reached the last chapter, where i had decided that i wanted to convey hope instead of despair, i felt mentally paralyzed."
17530,imprisonment,"it was the fear of being trapped by my own words that was so incapacitating—the horror that unveiled the dread of imprisonment, as if the words were going to define me, control my life, or i were going to be possessed by them."
17531,justice,"in fact, i could never have been able to do justice to those voices."
17532,death,"i want to remember the humiliation, the pain, and the suffering to be able to live every joyous moment of my life as a moment to treasure, as if it were the last moment before death knocks on my door."
17533,where,"i am writing to release myself into the world beyond boundaries where the imagination expands horizons for creating new selves, the  214  epilogue  selves that have their roots in the past but are not chained to it."
17534,death,"being kissed by death so closely, i remind myself that life is not a given, nor is freedom, so that tasting life in all its flavors is my desire and mission."
17535,taken,"yet in the summer of 2002, i had taken the risk of visiting my family and my home country, ironically also after more than eight years, nearly the same length of time i had spent in prison before returning to my family and iranian society in 1991."
17536,imprisonment,"the transformations i encountered during my visit, which i repeated in a longer stay from 2003 to 2004 and later again for three months in the spring of 2005, were as drastic as the ones during the period of my imprisonment, if not more so."
17537,term,"with mohammad khatami in his second term of presidency, the iran to which i returned was entirely different from the one i had left behind in late 1993."
17538,prisoners,"arrests and imprisonments occurred, but neither in scale nor in the treatment and persecution of prisoners could one compare this period to that of 1980s."
17539,case,"in this particular case of loss of values, both religious and nonreligious parents seemed to agree, though each pointed the finger at the other side."
17540,power,"when faced by their children’s blame for having brought this regime to power, those who were not supporters of the regime, which now included a large majority of the population, especially in tehran, often distanced themselves by putting the blame on others."
17541,stretch,"they illustrated their transgressions in their language, artistic productions, jokes, clothing, and social manners, through which they were in fact able to stretch the boundaries of the norms and regulations a great deal."
17542,power,"among these, the ones with stronger positions of power felt great animosity, for they perceived these transgressions, the bending of their fixed rules and regulations, as threats to their totalizing power and an undermining of their authority."
17543,term,"popular support, to the extent to which we may speak of popular support here in the conventional sense of the term, relied on the years of a widening economic, and consequently sociocultural and eventually political, gap within society."
17544,state,even more important was dealing with the political ramifications of these apparently apolitical acts and forms of speech for the society and the state.
17545,law,"the more the regime lost its legitimacy and popularity among its citizens, the greater its need became to depend on dogmatic interpretations of islamic law and fixed social codes."
17546,state,every seemingly simple act of transgression undermined the monopoly of the state over both violence and the life and death of its citizens.
17547,state,"the state-run media and the internet access that was made possible through mosques or other religious institutions, often supervised by government agents, offered a particular lens through which the less privileged population saw the world."
17548,authority,"any movement to question its authority was portrayed and stigmatized as the embodiment of the wealthy, corrupt, westernized group of nonbelievers fighting the government, which is paving the way for imam mahdi, the last absent imam of shi‘i."
17549,penal,"under khatami, however, the penal system, despite all its cruelties, did not seem tough enough for those in the government who sought to eradicate their enemies, the people who simply read, wrote, or produced artistic forms of expression that did not fit within the limits of their views."
17550,power,what better opportunity to gain momentum than the u.s. involvement in two wars in the middle east and its constant threats at the time to bring ahmadinezhad and his allies to power?
17551,penal,"his shaky ground among the clergy and the people, combined with his desire to hold on to power until his last breath, drove the supreme religious leader khomeini to draw closer to the most conservative clergy and rely on the power of the revolutionary guard and an increasingly dominant and dominating penal system."
17552,state,"the more scandalous the treatment of terrorist suspects by the united states, the less shame on the iranian side in the face of the revelation of the iranian citizens’ subjection to the cruelty of the state and its paramilitary or non-uniformed agents."
17553,war,"a new reign of power began that immediately bore a terrifyingly uncanny resemblance to those dark years following the iran-iraq war, the reign of an incredible brutality toward any voice of dissent."
17554,incarceration,"that day in the meeting room, which in the united antisabotage committee was supervised by the interrogators themselves, mohsen sat in his mother’s lap and began singing a childish song for me, the first he had learned, in which a thief is advised not to shoot the person who is advising him, for it would lead to his incarceration."
17555,thief,"with his words emerging through his teeth, in an angry tone, and with eyes that even terrified me, rahmani told mohsen, “motherfucker, you little ant are threateningâ€me with your gun.” in the song, ironically, it is the thief who uses the gun, not the child, but somehow rahmani had read mohsen’s song as a preplanned threat on himself."
17556,incarceration,“i will show you what incarceration means.
17557,jail,"and now he is really in jail, arrested in relation to the events following the disputed presidential election in iran in june 2009."
17558,imprisoned,he is no longer a child; he is now married and imprisoned along with his wife.
17559,imprisonment,"epilogue  219  when i was released from my second term of imprisonment in 1991, he was already sixteen years old and no longer a child so attached to his maternal aunts and uncles, almost all of whom, including me, left him at about the same time in the early 1980s because of the crackdown on the opposition."
17560,imprisoned,"they were either imprisoned, had fled the country for exile in europe or the united states, or lived as fugitives."
17561,imprisonment,"now he told me, “now that i am a grown-up and have learned how to handle my life on my own, what do i need you for?” this was, of course, more than painful to hear, but what i could hear was the fear of being attached once again, as he had been after i returned from imprisonment under the shah only to leave for an even longer period."
17562,imprisoned,"yet, like so many young people who used to blame their parents for sacrificing their lives without thinking about those who loved them, whose blood is now shed on the streets, who have now crowded the jails once again, mohsen, too, is imprisoned and tortured simply for daring to think and to speak up."
17563,execution,"it was the night of the same day i was working on the section of this text where i had a vision of hamid’s execution and his attempt to communicate with me, striving to reach out to me beyond prison walls."
17564,execution,"220  epilogue  i called my mother, hoping she would say, “no darling, it was just a dream.” but my mother was crying the way i had only seen her cry when she heard of hamid’s execution."
17565,torture,"they had brought mohsen for his first visit with his family, but right after severe torture and three days of sleep deprivation with no food or water."
17566,jail,"she was the only one of my siblings who was old enough to come to visit me in jail, and now she had to visit her own son in jail."
17567,jail,he does not know how to be in jail.
17568,torture,"we were the children of a time when we had known the price of saying “i love you” was being murdered or being chained in a torture chamber, when the idea of political reform in the system seemed entirely impossible."
17569,situation,not only did many people seem to believe that reform was a possible means of bringing about some desirable changes but they in fact did not see any other way out of the situation.
17570,power,"yet, no matter the child of what era one may be, the desire to be free, to care to know, and to love seems to never cease, nor  epilogue  221  does the will of the totalitarian regimes and technologies of power to silence dissident voices."
17571,torture,"in 2010, however, my writing is immersed in the pain of all those bodies and souls, including my beloved nephew and his wife, undergoing torture."
17572,torture,"if this writing can reveal something of our resilience and determination to withstand injustice and the destructive force of torture and violence through re-creating our love and remaking our life, i will have achieved more than i could have imagined."
17573,ward,"acknowledgments  in march 1978, we were temporarily transferred to a new ward, also located in ghasr prison, supposedly because the well in the yard of our ward was clogged."
17574,imprisonment,"here, in this temporary ward, i would have the strangest visit ever with my family in more than a decade of my imprisonment under the regimes of shah and the islamic republic."
17575,where,"on the day of our meeting, at nine in the morning, a guard called my name, but i looked at him with confusion because i did not know where i was to meet my family."
17576,ward,"there seemed to be no meeting room attached to this ward, like the one in the permanent ward."
17577,guard,the guard told me to go to the room across the hall and climb up to the third story of the only metal bed in the room and look out the window.
17578,where,"as i looked through the window, i saw, on a wide dirt road, my father nearly running while looking around in confusion, evidently not knowing where to go, and my mother trying to keep up with him, perhaps both waiting to see an entrance to a meeting hall."
17579,arrest,"my father was exemplary in his resistance to living an undignified life but, since my arrest, how often he had endured humiliation for my sake."
17580,imprisonment,"yet, without my parents’ love, their incredible humanity, and their trust in me, i could have neither overcome the torture and imprisonment of those many years nor been able to write about my experience."
17581,prisons,"when in 1999 i initially wrote these fragmented stories of lives in â�iranian prisons—lives that had been ruptured, cut short, or lived in insidious proximity to, and at the verge of, madness and death—my narrating voice vibrated with hesitation and burden that stemmed from the loneliness of the voices, of my own and of those whose stories i was trying  acknowledgments  225  to tell."
17582,imprisoned,"the families of those imprisoned, tortured, driven to insanity, or killed by the state were stigmatized and lived under constant scrutiny in a state of near terror."
17583,imprisonment,"many, including myself, who had been subjects of imprisonment and torture, left our home country, family, and the mass graves of our loved ones to face the challenges of a new life in an unfamiliar place and with a language that we had to learn as adults."
17584,state,"most of these survivors and their families never ceased to fight to keep the memories of resistance and the dead alive, yet their voices were either too far away or too low to be heard amid the state propaganda and everyday noises."
17585,war,"it is with dismay, however, that i realize, as i am bringing this text to an end with the hope of a new beginning, that the generation born and raised after the revolution, or even after the iran-iraq war, has now populated prisons their parents once occupied."
17586,torture,"they, too, experience the undignified and cruel treatment of torture chambers."
17587,executed,this is due to the unwavering struggles of the families of the executed dissidents.
17588,suppression,"however, the new dissident movement that has resurfaced since the midto late 1990s has been critical in summoning the ghosts of the revolutionary period and in exposing the suppression of the early 1980s."
17589,imprisoned,"here they were themselves tortured, imprisoned, raped, and killed for speaking their minds, asking for their vote, or freedom of expression."
17590,justice,"while the regime officials have strived to keep the veil as tight as possible, the ghosts of justice, those whose lives were so unjustly annihilated, have nonetheless haunted the islamic republic and kept it restless, alert to their haunting presence and to the questions of justice that they raise."
17591,imprisonment,"former political prisoners have also published a growing number of memoirs outside iran about the experience of imprisonment, each opening up a window to the dark, secretive maze of this monstrous system."
17592,taken,"writing about prison, i know firsthand, is a daunting task, and i am extremely grateful to those who have taken the steps to give voice to these silenced stories."
17593,justice,"most particularly, i am grateful to those generous souls who move beyond their own pain to listen to the sufferings of others and are capable of opening their embrace to whoever joins the fight for justice."
17594,state,"particularly intriguing is the way some individuals, especially young people, have begun to hear from and converse with the ghosts, in contrast to the way the state and those with older attitudes often impose their words on the dead or summon selective voices at the cost of silencing others."
17595,death,"it is to these refreshing voices that i owe the strength to finally let go of this book, hoping that, in light of this new attitude, it may be read, despite its flaws and shortcomings, for its efforts to tell a more complex story of violence and resilience to survive it, even at the cost of letting go of life when it may bring death to others."
17596,freedom,"even though my analysis of its dynamics led me to the horrifying prediction of yet another, at least momentary, defeat for the voices of freedom, i allowed myself to hope otherwise."
17597,crimes,"i had seen more than my share of the brutality and lies of the regime, but to witness the vicious crimes that it committed in the last year was even beyond my darkest prediction."
17598,war,"what was even more shocking was the fact that some of the subjects of these brutalities were the children of those killed in the iran-iraq war, recognized by the regime as martyrs, or former war veterans, the former supporters of the regime."
17599,state,"this ruthless suppression illustrates how deeply violence permeates  acknowledgments  229  the fabric of the society and seems indispensable to masculine power, be it that of the state, political parties, or individuals."
17600,state,the history of state violence in the world has many such examples to offer us.
17601,torture,every page offers testimony to the power of love that makes endurance of torture possible and heals the wounds of the soul and the body.
17602,freedom,"the book in its entirety is a witness to the desire for freedom that outlives the desire for self-preservation or conformism, as are the lives and/or deaths of the subjects of this book, and the spirits whose struggles have been currently adding new pages of human dignity to our recent history."
17603,death,"if seemingly dead poetry could enliven our sometimes fatally injured souls, those who, in shamlu’s words, “made their death a revolutionary song” render our entire existence luminous."
17604,imprisonment,"i also watched these resilient souls in 2009 during a hunger strike in berlin in the rain and cold, in protest of imprisonment, torture, and execution in iran."
17605,where,"the recognition i received from the department of anthropology at uc, berkeley, where my text was selected as the best honors’ thesis of the year in 1999, boosted my confidence in communicating this unusual story to a western audience."
17606,situation,"again, i am grateful to all my colleagues and many others whose names i have not mentioned here, but their presence has made me feel at home in my new job and situation."
17607,imprisonment,"not even once during all those years of my imprisonment did she pressure me to do anything against my will, even though this meant more suffering for her."
17608,state,"although she was illiterate, what she taught me about love and resilience, and even her beautiful version of faith, which so radically differs from that of the state, has allowed me to see the complexity and beauty of our humanity in the face of all the monstrosity of our world."
17609,law,"to all my siblings, and my brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, whose names i cannot mention here, i owe every minute of living this rich life of love and compassion."
17610,law,"i go to sleep wishing that one day i can hold my motherin-law in my arms and thank her for being such a gracious soul, and her children and grandchildren who still relate to me as if i am involved in their everyday lives."
17611,inside,he has never left me; he has in fact become the conscience inside me at those moments when my own seems to collapse.
17612,inmates,"notes  prologue page 4â•… cheshmhayashâ•… it is true that sometimes inmates did not tell the entire story of the activities for which they were arrested, but persecution over trivial issues such as goli’s were not rare occurrences."
17613,prisoners,"so prisoners themselves referred to taboota or dastgaha, the plural terms used in this book."
17614,torture,page 6â•… enhanced interrogation techniquesâ•… this term has been used by the government of the united states to legalize and exercise torture without naming it so.
17615,torture,"following september 11, 2001, the united states performed enhanced interrogation techniques and exceeded them in ways that shocked even those for whom the brutalities of torture were too familiar."
17616,torture,"as i think back, it occurs to me that since the training and technology for the techniques of interrogation and torture previously utilized by the shah’s regime were imported from the united states, so were the new ones, perhaps in accordance with the advice of the u.s. agents."
17617,torture,"he writes: “bottom line: not only do waterboarding and the other types of torture currently being debated put us in company with the most vile regimes of the past half-century; they’re also designed specifically to generate a (usually false) confession, not to obtain genuinely actionable intel."
17618,police,"run by savak, the shah’s secret police, it reported on these dissidents, who wasted their energy thinking they were fighting the regime while they were in fact entrapped in the savak net."
17619,power,"agamben, homo sacer: sovereign power and bare life, trans."
17620,prisoners,"all the interrogators had pseudonyms by which they were known, at least to prisoners."

17622,prisoners,he uses the example of a rumor in a small village in spain under franco’s dictatorship about a truth-telling machine that was supposedly used by interrogators to obtain information from prisoners.
17623,jail,"in light of the recent events in iran, i fear that someday she may end up spending years of her life in jail and return, if lucky, to a new family member whose birth she too will have missed."
17624,torture,"notes to pages 39–59  239  page 39â•… soudabeh ardavanâ•… soudabeh ardavan’s book of illustrations about torture in iranian prisons, yaadnegaarehaaye zendaan (reminiscences of prison years), was published in sweden in 2003."
17625,prisoner,"she was herself a prisoner for eight years, and we shared years in similar wards."
17626,ward,"there are also several prison memoirs that deal with this particular ward and the experiences lived within it, but all are published in farsi and are works in progress."

17629,inmates,"page 44â•… kinshipâ•… in a documentary film by pantea bahrami, and in love i live, a set of interviews with former iranian women political prisoners, mina akhbari speaks of a strong bond that she feels with her former fellow inmates, a bond that she says remains strong even if they do not see one another for years."
17630,torture,"page 57â•… escape the tortureâ•… in her discussion of freud’s reading of trauma in his beyond the pleasure principle, cathy caruth brings up the interesting point that “the literary resonance of freud’s example [a story told by tasso in his romantic epic gerusalemme liberata] goes beyond this dramatic illustration of repetition compulsion and exceeds, perhaps, the limits of freud’s conceptual or conscious theory of trauma.” as caruth asserts, what is “striking in the example of tasso is not just the unconscious act of the infliction of the injury and its inadvertent and unwished-for repetition, but the moving and sorrowful voice that cries out, a voice that is paradoxically released through the wound.” caruth, unclaimed experience: trauma and the possibility of history, yale french studies 79 (new haven: yale university, 1991), 2."
17631,torture,page 66â•… impairment in perceptionâ•… elaine scarry speaks of the “obliteration of the content of consciousness” as one of the elements of torture.
17632,tortured,"pain, in her words, “annihilates not only the objects of complex thought and emotion but also the objects of the most elemental acts of perception.” it goes so far as to impede the tortured person’s “ability simply to see.” scarry, the body in pain: the making and unmaking of the world (new york: oxford university press, 1987), 54."
17633,prisoner,"page 69â•… source of painâ•… scarry, in the body in pain, points to this reality when she argues that “the torturers, like pain itself, continually multiply their resources and means of access until the room and everything in it becomes a giant externalized map of the prisoner’s feelings” (55)."
17634,power,"page 70â•… totalizing and individualizing systemsâ•… michel foucault uses the terms “totalization and individualization” and argues that “power is not exercised simply as an obligation or prohibition on those who ‘do not have it’; it invests them, is transmitted by them and through them; it exerts pressure upon them, just as they themselves, in their struggle against it, resist the grip it has on them."
17635,power,"lastly, they are not univocal; they define innumerable points of confrontation, focuses of instability, each of which has its own risks of conflicts, of struggles, and of an at least temporary inversion of the power relations.” foucault, discipline and punish: the birth of the prison, trans."

17641,state,"page 83â•… lost her wayâ•… i am reminded of the words that describe the crimes in the wards as contagious: “do not glory in your state, if you are wise and civilized men; an instant suffices to disturb you and annihilate that supposed wisdomâ€of which you are so proud; an unexpected event, a sharp and sudden emotion ofâ€t he soul will abruptly change the most reasonable and intelligent man into a raving â�idiot.” michel foucault, madness and civilization, 212, quoting swiss physician andré matthey."
17642,torture,"page 87â•… persecution and tortureâ•… elaine scarry in the body in pain suggests that “the presence of pain is the absence of world” and that “the pain, like the interrogation, is a vehicle of self-betrayal” (46–47)."
17643,jail,"while i agree with scarry’s points, my experiences in jail led me to realize that what pains one individual may not pain another in the same way or even with the same effect."
17644,torture,"what is more important is that for some, the possibility of losing the world may be much more painful and frightening than the pain of torture."
17645,torture,scarry argues that the notion of betrayal does not take into account that what cannot betray is that which is absent and argues that the memory of the world ceases for the person under torture.
17646,torture,"however, i have seen and believe that sometimes there are other memories much more deeply engraved in one’s body and mind, and the pain of their loss, such as the loss of the self and the community, may surpass the pain of torture."
17647,torture,"there are individuals who would rather endure the pain of torture, even die under it, than drag others into it."
17648,torture,the world for these people does not become absent even while they are under the excruciating pain of torture; for them the real torture is to lose themselves and the world.
17649,prisoner,"page 88â•… torture’s victoryâ•… in her powerful rendition of torture and resistance, shokufeh sakhi, a former political prisoner herself and now a ph.d. candidate at york university in canada, cites a collaborator: “they [the islamic torturers] see a metaphysical power in the cable, a supra-human power."
17650,prisoner,"the entire body of the prisoner must be touched by the cable for the miracle to occur: that is, the person is changed from being a filthy, illegitimate creature who would be burned in the fires of hell into a clean, pure and legitimate creature who will go to heaven.” paper presented at the isis conference, “on the ethical meaning of torture and resistance,” toronto, canada, summer 2008, http://www.dialogt.org/english/shokoufeh%20sakhi2.htm."
17651,prisoners,"page 89â•… resistant prisonersâ•… again, in her reading of the citation from we lived to tell: political prison memoirs of iranian women (toronto: mcgilligan books, 2007), shokoufeh sakhi emphasizes the sociality of the impact of the tortured person’s reaction, including her or his resistance."
17652,torture,"she writes: “i contend that, beyond and aside  242  notes to pages 91–95  from obtaining information, etc., it is the ethical humanity, the socially responsible being, that torture seeks to foul with its rancid touch."

17657,inmate,"(shamlu, “āy eshgh,” in collection of poetry)  notes to pages 96–123  243  the particular verses recited by this woman inmate are these: my hands and my heart trembled of the fear that love becomes a refuge instead of a flight that love becomes a place to escape, instead of a flight."
17658,prisoners,"for the prisoners, redness in this poem symbolized courage and revolutionary ideals, while blue indicated honesty and purity of the heart, the person, and the cause."
17659,prisoner,"for this prisoner, her breaking under lashes and her submission to profess her faith in islam and pray indicated the failure of her revolutionary spirit and ideals."
17660,death,"page 97â•… escaped the sufferingâ•… this reaction reminds me of the work of nancy scheperhughes, death without weeping: the violence of everyday life in brazil (berkeley: university of california press, 1993), where she discusses the violence inherent in the everyday life of poverty being of a kind wherein the very possibility of death as a mundane, uneventful occurrence in the everyday—indeed, even a kind of mercy for an otherwise cruel existence—also measures the abjectness of life within that existence."
17661,freedom,"according to him, “madness threatens modern man only with the return to the bleak world of beasts and things, to their fettered freedom."
17662,liberty,"it is not on the horizon of nature that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries recognized madness, but against a background of unreason; madness did not disclose a mechanism, but revealed a liberty raging in the monstrous forms of animality.” foucault, madness and civilization, 25."

17665,situation,"page 123â•… not able to dieâ•… in the sickness unto death, kierkegaard defines despair as “the situation of the moribund when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die” (13)."
17666,criminal,"page 133â•… space between deathsâ•… i am borrowing this from veena das’s insightful reading of lacan’s interpretation of antigone’s story, in which lacan argues that differentiating between two deaths, the death of a brother and a husband or a child, makes it possible for antigone to “voice the truth of the uniqueness of being.” it is in speaking from this “zone between two deaths,” das suggests, “that the unspeakable truth about the criminal nature of the law” might be exposed."
17667,death,"page 135â•… chance of bidding farewellâ•… this reminds me of another phrase, “the moment of his death actually escaped me,” a phrase that is an invocation of cathy caruth’s reading of freud’s meditation of a father’s dream about his son’s burning while he falls asleep watching over his ill son."
17668,death,he thus misses the very moment of his son’s death.
17669,execution,"the moment of hamid’s execution escaped me but not in the same way as it escaped the woman in hiroshima mon amour, who so near her lover’s body could not “feel the slightest difference between his dead body and [her own].” caruth, unclaimed experience: trauma and the possibility of history, 38, 39."

17674,state,"she argues that “the shift in the image of the ideal woman from ‘modern-yet-modest’ at the turn of this century to ‘islamic-thus-modest’ within the present [islamic] paradigm could only take place because a crucial  246  notes to pages 147–160  shared social boundary regarding modesty was retained between the two.” she, however, suggests a paradigm shift and argues that to understand “the workings of that common boundary, we need to differentiate and investigate theâ€significance of each paradigm.” najmabadi, “hazards of modernity and morality: women, state and ideology in contemporary iran,” in women, islam and the state, ed."
17675,torture,"page 147â•… horror of tortureâ•… the term “naked horror” used by binswanger in “dream and existence” best describes what marjan was captivated by, due not to the “fear of annihilation” (312) but to the horror of sheer violence and the anxiety about the loss of the self that could follow."
17676,prisoner,page 147â•… prisoner of horrorâ•… binswanger’s words in “dream and existence” could have been literally written about marjan when he states that the subject for whom dread is internalized is imprisoned by her dread and thus “desperately beats at the walls of its prison” (314).

17678,power,"page 166â•… collective involvementâ•… there is also another reason for this tendency to act collectively in relation to violence that has to do with the power of mimesis, which allows the role of an agent and individual responsibility to be obscured and renders it easier to act violently."
17679,crime,"in collective acts of violence, either a single or a few individuals are singled out as the agents of the crime while others simply claim to have followed orders, as in nazi germany or south africa and many other similar situations, or an unaccountable guilty collective is identified without the possibility for any real identification."
17680,power,"page 171â•… prevalent and horrifyingâ•… in his discussion of “pathological forms” of power, or “diseases of power,” michel foucault argues that the reasons these regimes “are so puzzling for us is that, in spite of their historical uniqueness, they are not quite original."

17683,freedom,"page 190â•… imagination and phantasmâ•… as foucault asserts, “to imagine is not so much a behavior towards others which intends them as quasi-presences on an essential ground of absence; it is rather to intend oneself as movement of freedom which  248  notes to page 192  makes itself world and finally anchors itself in this world as its destiny.” michel foucault, “dream, imagination and existence,” introduction to michel foucault and ludwig binswanger, dream and existence, ed."
17684,imprisonment,this differentiation between the imagination and phantasm is what makes the former the embodiment of the possibility of creation and the latter the subject of imprisonment by the power of morbid images.
17685,power,"“the value of a poetic imagination,” foucault believes, “is to be measured by the inner destructive power of the image” (72)."
17686,power,page 192â•… giving ourselves awayâ•… foucault writes: “the relationship between â�power and freedom’s refusal to submit cannot therefore be separated.
17687,power,the crucial problem of power is not that of voluntary servitude (how could we seek to be slaves?).

17777,state,democracy exists when the people control the state: when that happens the government is forced to respect and listen to their people.
17778,state,"but in iran, how could the people have any power if they depended on the state for their wealth?"
17779,authority,"he looked proudly upon the motto that was scrawled on the walls of every army barrack in the country: “for god, for shah, for country.” it was a slogan that praised the three pillars of iranian society: faith first, then the king, whose authority rested on his role as defender of the shiite religion, and finally the nation, which existed thanks to his protection."

17788,situation,"abbas finally took the situation into his own hands, with his usual efficiency."
17789,where,"so simin was forced to give up her rose garden and the small plot where she cultivated fava beans, eggplants, tomatoes, and radishes."
17790,law,"and no one protested the least bit when abbas explained that it was necessary to sign over to her their inheritances, because the law permitted a woman to inherit only a small amount of the husband’s estate—certainly not enough to ensure her a peaceful life."
17791,officers,"furthermore he divided the food rations that the military provided to its officers into two parts, one for his mother and his brothers, and another for himself, his wife, and their two children."
17792,serving,"when she began again to receive guests, simin customarily offered, on her most splendid serving tray, the chocolate bars that he had given her."
17793,death,but everything changed after hossein’s death.
17794,arrested,"javad was still in high school when the father of his best friend was arrested and accused of fighting for the tudeh, the iranian communist party."
17795,war,the tudeh had been founded during the second world war by a group of marxist intellectuals who had been imprisoned by reza shah.
17796,power,"the shah’s son didn’t have enough power to eliminate them, and at first had allowed the party to practice freely."
17797,building,"thanks to russian support, the party had grown its own base, building consensus beyond the antimonarchist intellectuals in the capital, particularly among the oil well workers in the southern part of the country."
17798,illegal,but in 1949 the shah blamed the tudeh for the failed assassination attempt against him and declared them illegal.
17799,war,"even more severe measures were adopted after the fall of mossadegh, as a way to placate the united states, which at the time was in the middle of the cold war."
17800,dictatorship,"the tudeh continued to operate in shadows, however, and to attract global attention to the shah’s dictatorship."
17801,taken,"this, after all, was the route that javad had taken: no one had stopped him before it was too late."
17802,freedom,"abbas had defended javad when he was acting out as a kid, but the result was that he had now become a spoiled, bratty young man who went around challenging their leader like some kind of freedom fighter."
17803,death,"the rift that broke between them after the death of their father had become, in a single instant, an abyss so vast that it would swallow every bit of affection they had ever shared with each other."
17804,death,"it’s no fun.” the truth was that, since hossein’s death, my father had become terribly bored by our regular meetings with their family."
17805,where,"i just always feel like i don’t have enough time to get everything done.” “come with me—i’ll show you what a good time is.” she then dragged me on a marathon tour of shop windows, until we stopped to rest and restore our energy in a chelow kebabi, where parì satisfied her desire to review all of our past culinary experiences."
17806,arrested,"didn’t you see that, just yesterday, they arrested ten students?” “my father’s right."
17807,taken,it got so bad that abbas said he couldn’t believe that he had taken care of javad all these years.
17808,punishment,"it was august 19, the anniversary of the coup d’état, and he didn’t miss his chance to repeat the story of the pen and the punishment of the traitor."
17809,where,"“first of all, mossadegh wasn’t a traitor, he succeeded where reza shah failed: he nationalized the oil industry and fought to free us from foreign influence."
17810,locked,"you know that without the pahlavi, iranian women—god bless them—would still be locked up at home, hoping their husbands didn’t forget about them?” reza shah had understood the importance of modernizing the country, and he’d sent many young people to study abroad in europe, to become the professors of the future intellectual elite."
17811,disaster,it seemed an omen for an impending disaster.
17812,court,"i made an appointment to meet her at café naderì, but when i went to leave the court i found her waiting for me at the door."
17813,arrest,"“anyway, the shah canceled the rate increase, but then he decided he’d better arrest all the demonstrators."
17814,case,"someone who at least could find out something about his case, if only to calm my mother down a little?” parì chewed nervously on her lip."
17815,court,"but what i do in court has nothing to do with this kind of thing, and i don’t know anyone."
17816,prisoners,the opposition are ‘special’ prisoners and they aren’t processed through the usual channels.” “of course.
17817,where,it’s just i don’t know where to turn.
17818,cell,and deep down he thinks that javad deserves to be locked away in prison.” at the time i couldn’t really understand what it meant to be locked away in a solitary cell.
17819,wall,the floor is covered with wall-to-wall carpet encrusted with dust and excrement—it appears not to have been washed for years.
17820,inmate,"a spoon and a bowl of milk, belonging to some previous inmate, completes my inheritance."
17821,police,"one night, while a group of students from the university of tehran protested the closing of a progressive newspaper, the police and the lebas-shakhsi entered the dormitory, wounding a number of kids and killing one of them, ezzat ebrahimnezhad."
17822,convict,"i was the lawyer chosen by his family to discover and convict whoever had ordered the assault, and the person who had opened fire."
17823,court,"the witness had evidence of everything he alleged and wasn’t forced to retract anything, but the court chose to incriminate me for having entered false testimony rather than listening to his testimony."
17824,police,it was never a good idea to accuse the police of anything in the islamic republic of iran.
17825,cell,my cell faces an empty corridor.
17826,guard,"i don’t have a cushion and when i ask for one, the guard tells me that it’s not permitted."
17827,arrested,"when they arrested me they confiscated everything i was carrying: a pen, notebook, glasses, and, of course, my watch."
17828,arrest,"i desperately needed to reason, to take account of things, to know what time it was and how much time had passed since my arrest."
17829,suspect,but soon i begin to suspect that they’re deliberately substituting dinner for breakfast to make me lose track of time and go insane.
17830,guard,"once in a while the peephole opens and from the outside a guard watches me without saying a word, only to humiliate me and see me fall deeper and deeper into despair."
17831,detainees,but soon i remember that they’ve installed video cameras in the isolation cells to monitor the movements of the detainees.
17832,cell,once a week a female guard leads me out of the cell to take a shower.
17833,cell,"the next day i’m forced, without gloves, to wash my cell, the bathroom, the bathtub, and the corridor."
17834,torture,"with that glimmer of rational thought that still gives resistance, i try to convince the guards to have the cleaning done before i take my shower rather than after, but it’s not possible to alter this absurd torture."
17835,interrogation,every night a different guard brings me into the interrogation room.
17836,torture,only after it’s over will i learn that psychologists call solitary isolation “white torture.” javad remained in prison for a year.
17837,freedom,javad was released without knowing to whom he owed his freedom.
17838,torture,"in prison they had whipped the soles of his feet as a form of torture: as soon as the wounds showed signs of healing, they’d reopen them with more violent lashes."
17839,serving,"she dusted off her magic culinary utensils and organized a large family lunch, serving all of javad’s favorite dishes."
17840,locked,"to avoid simin’s constancy, he spent much time out of the house, wandering about without any specific destination, or he locked himself in his room, stretched out along the horrible wooden board that he’d chosen to serve as his bed."
17841,detention,"if this battle was his destiny, sooner or later it was likely that he’d be forced into hiding or arrested again: better then to be prepared and train himself right now, in body and spirit, for the trials of another detention—so this meant adapting his bony back to the wooden board."
17842,torture,"after prison he felt like a man: he had submitted to his isolation and reclusion in silence, he had forgotten hunger, he had resisted torture."
17843,sentence,"finally he realized that the problem was his prison sentence, and it’d be difficult to find anyone who would give him a second chance, at least in tehran."
17844,police,"he was certain this would always be the case: wherever he went, the secret police would be keeping an eye on him."
17845,death,"after his death, what was a humble village was transformed into the most important holy site for shiites; for twelve hundred years it has been visited by millions of pilgrims."
17846,state,"a great center of religious studies, mashhad had been the site of numerous revolts during the reign of reza shah against those who, like ataturk in turkey, promoted the laicization of the state."
17847,state,"reza shah had been the first ruler to open the sanctuaries to tourists; he also reformed the civil code by adding laws of european origin, transferred judicial power from the religious leaders to the courts (thereby breaking strongly with sharia law), returned the country to its pre-islamic origins by restoring the persian calendar and, in 1935, changing the official name of the nation from the state of persia to iran."
17848,inside,"inside the haram-e motahhar, the sanctuary’s core, dozens of beggars approached with outstretched hands."
17849,where,simin headed straight for the fountain where the pilgrims washed their hands and feet before entering the sacred areas.
17850,ordered,we rejoined the ordered procession of pilgrims who every day visited the mausoleum to beg for the imam’s protection.
17851,inside,"as soon as my eyes, dazzled by the sun, grew accustomed to the light inside, i spotted the enormous golden memorial chapel that protected the tomb from human contact."
17852,where,"“all right, where are we going next?” parì proposed going to tus to visit the tomb of the poet ferdousi, author of the epic national poem the shahnameh, or book of the kings."
17853,taken,i knew her well enough to understand that she was taken aback by alì’s refusal.
17854,inside,"finally, after a long silence, parì found the words for what she wanted to say: “it’s really a sin to waste such a beautiful day closed up inside a mosque."
17855,taken,a mullah had taken him under his wing and gave him the kind of attention that he had never received at home.
17856,taken,"he’d taken his books and his pamphlets, he stuffed in his suitcase whatever old clothes he could still fit into, and he left, leaving behind only a card: maman, there’s nothing for me in tehran."
17857,where,"religious groups and students boycotted the vote; in response the army occupied the university of tehran, where hundreds of students protested, shouting, “yes to reforms, no to the shah!” with the white revolution, mohammad reza risked alienating a number of allies."
17858,establishment,"nor did the clergy accept the establishment of an “army of knowledge,” a group of young diplomats sent throughout the countryside to teach peasants how to read and write, work traditionally overseen by the mullahs and that assured them a solid base of influence."
17859,arrested,"though he was arrested many times, he didn’t stop his attacks and expressed rage when mohammad reza agreed to concede diplomatic immunity to all americans in exchange for new arms shipments."
17860,imprisoned,"the demonstrators in 1963 were imprisoned, tortured, and killed."
17861,state,"the enemies of the sovereign fell into three categories: nationalists, who had inherited mossadegh’s liberal ideas; communists, who joined various local organizations; and religious advocates, who were opposed to the laicization of the state and to the emancipation of women."
17862,power,"the shah, who owed his power to his support of the united states, observed this first group with the greatest suspicion, fearing that they might align with the american government and overthrow him."
17863,state,"in any case, the islamic groups appeared the most innocuous: being opposed to the laicization of the state, they could neither align themselves with liberal america or atheistic ussr."
17864,law,the funeral rites in his honor concluded with a clash between the crowd and law enforcement.
17865,freedom,"protests followed, one after the next: the intellectuals demanded freedom, the religious advocates rose up in favor of the exiled khomeini, and the workers went on strike, testing the strength of the national economy."
17866,power,"on september 8, 1978, after a particularly effective demonstration, the shah ordered the military to shoot into the crowd, a day that would henceforth be known as “black friday.” afraid of the power of the religious groups, he tried to further marginalize khomeini by having him expelled from neighboring iraq."
17867,conviction,"after years of silence and forced support, i had become optimistic, while at the university, with the conviction that we might be able to accomplish something."
17868,power,"though i had yelled then against the increase in enrollment taxes, by 1978 it seemed that we—that all of us—had the power to change the country."
17869,liberty,"with my husband and some friends, we joined the marches and shouted our slogan: “independence, liberty, the islamic republic!” at the time i really believed that an islamic republic would bring us independence and liberty."
17870,death,"now that same mullah was walking with a self-assuredness that bordered on haughtiness, shouting, “death to the shah!” alì followed him like a shadow."
17871,question,"why don’t we give you a little bit of a trim?” every time javad saw him he asked the same question, moving his fingers to imitate the scissors."
17872,death,"they had woken her up in the middle of the night, terrified to death of what might have happened."
17873,ordered,"he changed his advisors, he accepted some demands, but then he ordered the troops to fire on the crowds."
17874,law,"to calm the waters, bakhtiyar promised to suspend martial law and advised the shah to leave the country temporarily."
17875,where,"when sullivan passed the message to him, mohammad reza told him, “ok, but where should i go?” the americans, his former supporters, didn’t want to risk alienating the revolutionaries and pushing them toward an alliance with the soviet union."
17876,where,"in the middle of january 1979 the shah left for egypt, where he visited president anwar el-sadat."
17877,where,"by that time his health had greatly deteriorated; the shah left the united states and returned to egypt, where he died on july 27, 1980."
17878,state,his friend sadat honored him with a state funeral.
17879,authorities,"in iran the authorities had closed the airports to try to prevent khomeini’s return, but just two weeks after the shah had left, on february 1, 1979, the ayatollah landed in tehran."
17880,guard,"he assumed control of pahlavi’s wealth, with which he maintained the pasdaran, the new revolutionary guard that he wanted to align with the military."
17881,institution,"the supreme leader, who was also a religious leader, had effectively gained control of the government’s legislative, judicial, and executive branches, and had no need to bother with the parliament, the people, or any other institution, even though article 5 established that the people needed to elect the leader with a majority vote."
17882,power,the guardian council wields enormous power.
17883,power,furthermore the council has veto power over any law passed by parliament that it believes to violate the constitution or islamic principles.
17884,law,"since there have always been divergences of opinion among the various schools of islam, it’s easy for the guardian council to justify rejecting any law they don’t like."
17885,freedom,"it’s no surprise that such a self-referential constitutional arrangement hasn’t brought democracy to iran, nor is it surprising that the islamic republic has killed every hope we have had for freedom."
17886,ordered,after summary trials that ignored the most elementary rights of the accused—like the right to self-defense—it ordered supporters of the previous government to be shot.
17887,situation,"then came the situation with the kurds: using the secessionist claims of the iranian kurds as a pretext, khomeini condemned hundreds of people to death."
17888,taken,among the first measures taken by the islamic republic’s new government to bring about this longanticipated transformation of iran were the legalization of polygamy and the decree that women must wear the veil.
17889,situation,"when we still believed in the revolution and sung hymns to khomeini, she was the only one who said,  with eerie prescience, “you’ll see, the situation won’t get any better."
17890,authority,"they’ll even outlaw the few types of alcohol that we’re still allowed to drink.” alì, however, believed that we were witnessing the fulfillment of his dream for iran: khomeini had installed the velayat-e faqih, “guardianship of the jurist,” an islamic authority that determined the rights of citizens."
17891,power,"the soviet union sent in troops to prevent the fall of the regime but the persecuted mujahidin held their power, becoming the most feared islamic group."
17892,law,and he hadn’t even studied law; in fact he didn’t even have a diploma.
17893,law,"he had advanced degrees in philosophy, law, and economics; he taught at the university; he wrote about human rights; and he knew english and french perfectly."
17894,war,"he drove around by himself in an old peykan; the new procurator, by contrast, had a bulletproof foreign car and was escorted by twenty members of the pasdaran, as if we were at war."
17895,serving,"after receiving my college degree, a doctorate, and serving ten years on the bench, i was reduced to the level of a secretary."
17896,where,"now it was where the warriors of faith gathered: every day at noon, the revolutionaries competed in displays of religious zeal."
17897,criminals,"after the small-talk came the threats: the era of the shah was over, criminals and miscreants would be shot."
17898,state,whoever didn’t obey the rule of the state would be eliminated.
17899,law,"well, here’s your daughter-in-law, fariba.” “hello,” said fariba nervously."
17900,law,simin froze for a second before she greeted her daughter-in-law in a faint voice.
17901,law,"“javad hasn’t told me anything—a little strange that i didn’t know i had a daughter-in-law until today, no?” simin’s disapproval couldn’t find hiding."
17902,where,"javad pushed fariba ahead of him down the hallway, glancing toward the living room where parì was laid out on the divan, reading a book."
17903,insane,"he snuck quietly over to his sister, like he was playing some big practical joke, and after taking a deep breath, he exclaimed, “sister, meet my wife!” “have you gone insane?"
17904,where,"where’d you come from—?” parì jumped to her feet, shaking her short bob, as if to wake herself up."
17905,locked,she locked herself in the kitchen and didn’t come out for hours.
17906,law,that girl is her daughter-in-law.
17907,guilt,"“i think,” she added, “that she feels a sense of guilt about our father."
17908,death,"since his death, my brothers have gone their separate ways."
17909,locked,"well, you see, it’s as if each one of them has locked himself in a golden cage—beautiful, strong, and as safe and secure as any ideology."
17910,guilty,"maman is incapable of this, and she feels guilty about it.” there was an uncharacteristically melancholy note in the voice of my radiant, irreverent friend."
17911,guilty,"she had a guilty expression on her face, as if she was confessing some fantasy of which she was ashamed."
17912,law,"blushing a little, she said, “i’m becoming a pretty mean sister-in-law, huh?” “shirin joon, where are the flowers?” my mother asked."
17913,where,"“hey, alì, where’s your mullah?” realizing that he wasn’t going to respond, javad continued, “when are you and your beard going to come visit me?"
17914,law,“have you met my daughter-in-law?
17915,executed,"just one month earlier his only son, morad, had been executed for having collaborated with the mujahidin-e khalgh, the “army of the people”—religious extremists faithful to marxists principles and opposed to being governed by clerics."
17916,ordered,"as soon as the clerics took over, they ordered a massive purge of the mujahidin-e khalgh; in 1981 they tried to eliminate every member of the party."
17917,sentence,"having made a full declaration of war, the mujahidin allied with saddam hussein’s iraq, antagonizing the iranian people and effectively signing their own death sentence."
17918,conviction,"she wore a chador that covered her entire body: such a garment was called a “veil by constriction, not by conviction.” all you could tell was that she was short, but under that huge cloak she could conceal all other traits."
17919,question,"now fariba prays constantly, fasts during ramadan, attends religious meetings, and looks with disdain on all her old friends—” “and on javad?” i interrupted, unable to hold back the question."
17920,law,"she didn’t try to select their spouses, but she expected to be consulted and to approve of her future daughters-in-law."
17921,serving,"she wouldn’t interfere in the choice of the dowry, praising whatever glasses, serving trays, linens, and kitchenware the daughter’s mother might choose."
17922,law,"she had for some time been copying her secret recipes into three small leather-bound notebooks, which she planned to give to the three daughters-in-law upon returning from their honeymoons."
17923,question,"it was out of the question that fariba, even when she was still close to javad, might take part in such a tradition: good soldier that she was, she had little time for cooking."
17924,serving,"his mother complied by serving steamed rice with a few vegetables, yogurt, and a little meat."
17925,wall,a large photograph of the wedding hung on the wall.
17926,law,"from that simple gesture i could tell that she loved her young daughter-in-law, despite her meager culinary gifts."
17927,law,“see what my sister-in-law is doing to me?
17928,locked,"she was determined not to end up, like them, locked in a golden cage."
17929,law,"here i was, despite my experience, having to take a clerical job, while alì, who had never even seen a law book, would be an investigator?"
17930,law,"since when can a judicial investigator not have a law degree?” “since the procurators don’t need to have one either,” said parì, with impeccable logic."
17931,killing,"the anxiety is killing her.” “what’s wrong, parì?"
17932,arrested,she had the same tense expression on her face as when they had arrested her brother.
17933,power,"and since khomeini took power he had been rooting out, one by one, his former supporters, purging the enemies of allah and of iran."
17934,arrested,they’re either arrested or they vanish.” parì couldn’t go on.
17935,arrested,when i hear the phone ring i always think that it’ll be someone telling me that javad has been arrested.
17936,authorities,"” i knew that the new government, promising clemency, had ordered the members of the party to turn themselves over to the authorities immediately."
17937,jail,"i don’t want him to end up on the ‘ramp of repentance.’” political prisoners were sent to a jail in evin, north of tehran."
17938,gate,"before one reached the prison gate, there was a very steep incline; to taunt the counterrevolutionaries, the prison guards told them that the ramp would make them repent, even before they got to the prison."
17939,jail,"even if he were sent to jail, he wouldn’t rat on his fellow travelers and he wouldn’t renounce his beliefs."
17940,torture,not even under torture.
17941,police,"he’s already been close to death, with the savak.” the savak, an acronym for sazeman-e ettela’at va amniyat-e kehvar, the organization of national security and information, was the secret police during the time of the shah."
17942,prisoners,"their methods included electroshock therapy, beatings, and red-hot irons; sometimes they pulled out prisoners’ fingernails."
17943,police,"horrific as this might seem, such tactics were not particularly novel—they were employed by secret police all over the world, long before the savak, and the same atrocities are still committed to this day."
17944,prisoners,"for this reason one couldn’t appeal to their religious values: they represented a force of good that transcended such earthly concerns as misery, so they didn’t hesitate to torture their prisoners with astonishing cruelty."
17945,power,they were also drawn by the bitter and inebriating seductions of power.
17946,where,"instead i asked, “has javad thought of leaving town?” “and go where?"
17947,cell,"much later, parì told me the truth about their marriage: the tudeh—to which they both belonged at the time—had asked them to wed, so that they could run a clandestine cell together."
17948,where,"they sat me down in the living room, where three trays filled with various types of pastries awaited me."
17949,state,"after the islamic revolution, a law was passed that gave the state the right to claim all property belonging to iranian citizens who had been abroad for more than a year."
17950,sentenced,property belonging to citizens who were being sought by the state or had already been sentenced to prison was confiscated and appropriated immediately; in other cases the measure was temporary.
17951,law,"when the person returned to the country, he could reclaim possession of his property, as long as he covered the enormous costs of “management.” the law was intended to discourage expatriation, but it wasn’t effective: almost four million iranians fled the country, abandoning their homes and their possessions, even their loved ones."
17952,state,"it said that abbas had to appear within a week, otherwise the state would be forced to take the necessary measures, etcetera."
17953,law,i need to study the law and find out if there is any precedent for this.
17954,taken,"she had taken the news of her illness with a sense of resignation, almost serenity."
17955,taken,"abbas had taken her to the hospital, caressing her thin fingers and speaking to her until the doctors came to take her away."
17956,wall,"strangers would soon move into his home, redecorate the rooms, perhaps even knock down a wall or two, and he couldn’t do anything about it."
17957,where,they had only needed a single night to erase every trace of abbas from the house where he had lived for twenty years.
17958,war,"after the beginning of the war with iraq in 1980, food had been rationed and essential goods were in short supply."
17959,war,"every word needed to be carefully chosen to avoid denunciation and suspicion, and everyone had to praise the revolution and the war without hesitation."
17960,illegal,"even today, the regime’s agents will burst into people’s homes and confiscate illegal antennae."
17961,building,"besides the legal problems this creates for the tenant, the building owners must also pay enormous fines."
17962,state,"but in the villa on the caspian sea, unpestered by state officials, my sister had an antenna and we could get a signal from most international channels."
17963,torture,but soon we realized how critical the situation was for iran—far worse than what we had imagined—and the news reports became a daily torture.
17964,war,"men both young and old enlisted, eager to fill the ranks of an army that had been decimated—first by the postrevolutionary purges, then by the number of those who had been lost in the war."
17965,taken,"he had taken mariam and ruhollah with him, settling first in ahvaz, the capital of khuzestan province."
17966,police,"he feared a new police crackdown on dissidents, and instead returned to rasht."
17967,guilt,"then we ran to call friends and relatives in the attacked areas to find out if they were ok. we hadn’t been able to leave behind our uneasiness and stress, and we felt a gnawing sense of guilt for having extricated ourselves from what otherwise might have been a very different fate."
17968,where,does everyone who lives in tehran have a villa where they can run to and hide?” she stared at him uncomprehendingly.
17969,guilt,"i felt slightly reckless but at the same time i’d finally freed myself from that subtle, gnawing sense of guilt."
17970,arrested,"“they arrested javad,” she blurted out, and her body went limp—emptied of the news that she had bottled up for days."
17971,police,the police attacked the party’s central location: two are dead and the others are in prison.
17972,where,javad is with them.” “where have they put him?” parì shrugged.
17973,escaped,"when he saw that the apartment where they had lived had been destroyed, he escaped for pakistan—for baluchistan."
17974,jail,but i can’t bear to imagine what might happen to him in jail.” she had tears in her eyes.
17975,imprisonment,"she was thinking, like me, about how her brother had declined during his first imprisonment."
17976,war,“now we’re at war.
17977,where,do you know any judges who might be willing to see me and at least tell me where javad is?
17978,detainees,"those now in charge obey every order and have no power, especially when it comes to political detainees.” i felt extremely uncomfortable."
17979,situation,in the past years the human rights violations reported in iran had been so egregious that the united nations had asked one of their own representatives to observe the situation firsthand.
17980,pen,"i took a piece of paper and a pen from my office desk and began to write in farsi, while parì translated into english."
17981,war,i had written that i knew javad well and that he had nothing to do with the war; he was the director of cultural affairs for his party and he had been arrested for his political beliefs.
17982,prisoners,"he had been denied every basic human right granted to prisoners, including the right to consult with a lawyer, and the right to see his family."
17983,war,"in iran the level of oppression had never been so high; using national security  and the war with iraq as a pretext, the state monitored the telephone lines and the mail."
17984,taken,"extreme measures weren’t taken against everyone, of course, but those whom the regime suspected of being in contact with international organizations were under close surveillance."
17985,state,"i couldn’t be certain that the state censors had intercepted my mail, but my letters for javad ran the risk of not being delivered."
17986,charges,the charges need to be written on paper.
17987,crimes,he’d do anything to expose the regime’s crimes.” i thought about it for a minute.
17988,justice,“for once it won’t be ruined by your obsession with saffron.”  16 the doctor’s justice  javad’s story was not an exceptional one in khomeini’s iran.
17989,arrest,i received a sad reminder of this one morning not long after i heard the news of his arrest.
17990,arrested,"my mother called me, overcome with anxiety; without even bothering to say hello, she said: “shirin, they arrested the doctor.” the “doctor,” as we called him, was my uncle."
17991,war,"the government was in a perpetual state of alert, especially since the outbreak of the war, and any type of behavior could be subject to misinterpretation."
17992,criminal,"the allegation that someone was participating in a coup d’état was the most common outcome: when in doubt, the state saddled every criminal, whether guilty or simply suspected, with this gratuitous accusation."
17993,jail,"the slightest suspicion, unsupported by any evidence, was enough to arrest an innocent man, keep him in jail for months, torture him to obtain improbable confessions, and execute him."
17994,justice,"then there were those cases in which the government would change its mind and plead “miscarriage of justice.” the government had already done this numerous times, pardoning itself for unjust executions and celebrating the victims as martyrs—as if they had chosen to die to satiate the paranoia of the government."
17995,war,the victim’s family received a pension equal to that received by families who had lost a son in war.
17996,case,we had to intervene right away to determine the specifics of the case and exculpate him.
17997,pleading,you know how to calm him down.” my mother was pleading now.
17998,guilt,"i felt a terrible pang of guilt at the thought that i was, in some way, lying to my father."
17999,arrest,"friends and relatives had heard about the arrest and they’d called to find out what had happened, and show their solidarity; to keep this from baba she was forced toward vagueness with them and finally to end the conversations abruptly."
18000,freed,fortunately they’re freed as soon as the judges realize the error.
18001,guilty,it’ll be easy to prove that he’s not guilty.
18002,where,"i’m just amazed at what an ugly country we live in, where an old professor can’t enjoy his pension in peace."
18003,situation,"what will the next generation ever do to fix this situation?” “take care of their uncles, no?” i said, trying to make light of the situation."
18004,guard,"the meeting had been rushed, and a guard hovered around them for at least ten minutes."
18005,arrested,he explained why he was arrested.
18006,arrested,"in this man’s address book they had found my uncle’s telephone number; naturally he was deemed a suspect and arrested, along with everyone else whose name was listed."
18007,situation,"in a different context i might have laughed at the absurdity of the situation, but now i became filled with rage at this blatant violation of human rights, the precariousness in which we all found ourselves, and the realization of how far our judicial system had fallen."
18008,state,we started to worry and soon slipped into a state in which we began to expect the worst.
18009,evin,“he works at evin prison.
18010,prisoner,he knew that the doctor was a prisoner there so he paid attention whenever his name came up in conversation.
18011,death,he’s just learned that the doctor is on the list of those condemned to death.
18012,execution,"his execution is imminent.” my father, turning pale, collapsed into his chair."
18013,evin,a week later we were invited to evin to see the doctor.
18014,justice,"evidently iran’s “justice system” was functioning fine, as long as you knew who to pay."
18015,freed,"they’ve freed him, they’ve freed him!” my father and i watched her incredulously."
18016,prisoners,“at evin there’s a small hospital for the prisoners.
18017,prisoners,at first i wanted to refuse—the idea of collaborating with the pasdaran horrified me—but then i realized that i could alleviate the suffering of the prisoners.
18018,tortured,"they’d been tortured, you see."
18019,facility,while i was working at the hospital the head physician happened to stop by the facility and he recognized me.
18020,law,"he had been a student of mine at the university and has since enjoyed a good career, helped along the way by his father-in-law, a mullah in khomeini’s circle."
18021,justice,"“i didn’t even have time to call you before i left.” there wasn’t much to be proud of in the way that justice had been administered, i thought bitterly."
18022,execution,"as a child i had only understood the literal significance of this ancient persian proverb, but as an adult i intuited what it actually meant: the experience that we accumulate day by day causes us to know and accept strange, even incomprehensible realities—like that of a man arrested by mistake, spared from execution by a bribe, and released by a stroke of luck."
18023,evin,"17 the visit to evin  as my family and i were trying to rescue the doctor, the letters that i’d sent for javad started to work."
18024,prisoner,one day parì received a message on her voice mail that informed her of the date and hour in which she could visit the prisoner.
18025,war,"because of the rationing and the war, this gift cost a small fortune, but when it came to her children, it was worth it."
18026,charges,"that morning she took great care with her dress, despite having already decided to wear a chador: it seemed important to ingratiate herself with the guards and demonstrate to them that she was the irreproachable mother of a son who was an honest man, despite the charges against him."
18027,prisoners,"like prisoners, simin and parì had to walk up the ramp of repentance."
18028,state,this is now state property.
18029,prisoners,don’t you know that prisoners can’t receive gifts?
18030,prisoners,"then a guard ordered them to enter the visiting room; the earlier group was just leaving, relatives bending to hear one final detail before the gray curtain lowered completely and the prisoners disappeared from the other side of the glass."
18031,wall,"it was a dark room, four meters wide by twenty meters long; in the middle there was a wall, the upper half of which was a pane of glass, and on either side there were booths less than a meter wide, which were separated by thin partitions."
18032,detainees,"visits lasted just a few minutes: the detainees on their side of the wall, their relatives on the other—physical contact was not allowed."
18033,pleading,"javad didn’t respond, only slightly shook his head, as if her pleading had nothing to do with him."
18034,wall,"when his mother’s prayers rose to a single, monotonous lament that flowed without interruption from one side of the wall to the other, he finally said, “parì, maybe you can explain to maman why i can’t.” “javad, javad, think of your youth."
18035,torture,"the party bosses are old, but even they resist torture."
18036,cell,since he’d been locked in a solitary  cell he didn’t realize how many of his fellow travelers had since surrendered.
18037,evin,"as soon as they were out of evin, they both felt the impulse to ruffle their clothes and veils, trying to shake off the prison smell."
18038,where,"i was always moved by the intensity of the ties that form spontaneously in eastern cultures, where a distant kinship or an even more fragile pretext is enough to establish a sense of common purpose."
18039,where,"the next day arya picked me up to take me to san diego, where abbas was living."
18040,term,"the american word “business” recurred frequently in his speech, though he seemed unaware of the fact that he was introducing an american term into farsi."
18041,where,his associate had recently financed a new investment: they had bought land in the los angeles suburbs where they were constructing a series of small houses that they expected to sell at a high profit.
18042,where,"here it’s not like iran, where everyone gets married because their parents expect them to."
18043,wall,the white wall in front of me was dominated by photographs of hossein and simin’s wedding; directly beside it were photos from the wedding of abbas and touran.
18044,where,"abbas kept a photograph of her as a young girl on the bedside table, on the side of the bed where she had slept."
18045,building,"he wanted him to move into a small house that he was building, but abbas opposed the idea in a tone that forbade any further discussion."
18046,state,"abbas’s efforts to give the room a sense of order and cleanliness, a representation of his last shred of dignity, made me much sadder than the apartment’s general state of neglect."
18047,death,"abbas spoke to me a long time about touran’s illness, about her death and the void that it left behind; he told me about the debts he incurred trying to pay for health care, of his financial problems and his continuous sacrifices."
18048,guilt,"abbas, one of the shah’s most faithful generals, was left with a sense of guilt for what he now considered to have been desertion."
18049,trial,"abbas realized, too, that the second he set foot in iran he’d be executed without a trial."
18050,taken,“my only regret is not having taken with me a handful of dirt from my house.
18051,wall,"perhaps, when it’s my turn, we’ll both be able to return together.” abbas was staring at a fixed point on the wall over my shoulder, the cup of tea going cold in his hand."
18052,death,"they also were yelling, ‘death to the shah!’—those traitors."
18053,state,"you know that the french, americans, and british treated him as if he were already head of state?"
18054,ordered,"“they ordered us to suppress the demonstrations, but what could we do?"
18055,ordered,but nobody ordered one.
18056,escaped,"they escaped, and none of them stayed behind to collect the bodies."
18057,ordered,“then they ordered us to stop shooting.
18058,death,"if he had remained, he might have been able to defend the monarchy, or else died a hero’s death."
18059,killing,"if he remained, we would’ve continued to shoot, killing even more young people."
18060,tortured,"the dissidents, or those suspected of dissidence, are captured, tortured, killed."
18061,ordered,do you know how many executions have been ordered since the revolution?
18062,situation,"we met to discuss the political situation, and our options for defeating the revolution."
18063,situation,"“one of the men among us that day, however, was huyser— general huyser—sent from the united states to make sure that the situation was kept under control."
18064,war,"defections in the barracks don’t matter, but if the army gets involved, a civil war will break out.’ “no one spoke."
18065,war,we have to prevent a civil war.
18066,killing,"“when i left, i thought about killing myself."
18067,power,“the iranian people had been worn down by too many years of violence and abuses of power.
18068,where,"and the shah trusted him and said only, ‘very well, but where should i go?’ even huyser tells the same story."
18069,sentences,"look here.” he opened general huyser’s book, mission to tehran, and pointing to the underlined sentences, repeated, “see, he admits it."
18070,term,"they were called “shahollah,” the shah’s party, in contrast to hezbollah, the party of god—a term that we used to describe khomeini’s most rabid supporters."
18071,where,"abbas’s thoughts had never evolved past the military academy, where he had ingested the throne’s propaganda."
18072,insane,"why—what did you think?” “i think it’s insane, abbas khan."
18073,pen,"when parì cleared out my apartment, did she take mossadegh’s pen?"
18074,taken,he was satisfied with the direction his life had taken.
18075,war,"he wrote about little ruhollah’s progress, his wife’s volunteer work, though not much about the war—he knew most things wouldn’t make it through the censors."
18076,arrested,"but after javad was arrested again, he wrote less frequently, worried that he might be “contaminated” by his traitor brother."
18077,death,"it was easy to forget that he was risking his life every moment, that the men under that blue sky were fighting with real weapons and bled real blood, that they were fighting to advance the front—or simply just to avoid death."
18078,war,"the iraqi military, which had a superior air force, body armor, and heavy and light artillery, created problems for iran’s defense; in the first months of the war iran was forced to surrender the cities of abadan and khorramshar."
18079,escaped,"mariam and ruhollah had escaped those huge attacks of the first two years unharmed, and now, with the shifting battle lines and the iraqi’s partial withdrawal, they almost felt safe."
18080,building,"two houses had been demolished; they collapsed into a nearby building, and then poured onto the street."
18081,ordered,"alì ordered his division to dig out the site, but after a day and a night of searching the solders were showing signs of giving up."
18082,camp,"he took off his helmet and said, “let’s go back to camp.” he hadn’t even found a piece of fabric, a trinket, or a splinter of furniture that he could put in his pocket and carry with him onto the battlefield."
18083,death,"he threw himself into the arms of death, but death didn’t want him."
18084,ordered,"her apartment was too small so she decided to rent a large, unfurnished room, and ordered a hundred folding chairs."
18085,taken,"the photo was taken at a three-quarter angle, with abbas in uniform, staring straight ahead."
18086,war,the ranks of the military had been decimated by the new regime’s “purification” efforts and by the war.
18087,death,"javad was in prison, alì was at the front, borna and arya were in america; simin was in intensive care after suffering a heart attack at the news of abbas’s death."
18088,war,"“we’re trying to stop saddam hussein’s army.” they had entered a new phase of the war; after iraq’s initial advances, khomeini was recapturing his lost territories, and he had indignantly refused the united nations’ peace plan, hoping instead to spread further his islamic revolution."
18089,death,"my mother enveloped parì in a heavy embrace: “i never thought i’d be around to witness the death of one of your brothers,” she whispered."
18090,where,"“when you want to talk, you know where to find me,” i said."
18091,where,"abbas went to put it in the living room, on a bookshelf, where arya kept his bills and other mail."
18092,death,"his whole childhood flashed by in a few pages, some of them taken after touran’s death."
18093,building,"the two boys grew up, and there they were on their first day of college, standing in front of the building, just as their mother had always wanted."
18094,taken,"waking up at such an early hour every morning, all year long, had taken a toll."
18095,wall,he glanced at the clock on the wall.
18096,taken,after putting the plate into the dishwasher he returned to the living room and started searching for the old photographs he’d taken with him from tehran.
18097,death,"i’m crying for arya, who adored him and whose conscience will always bear the weight of his father’s death.”  21 something warm  parì walked the “ramp of repentance” for the second time at the beginning of 1988."
18098,evin,"like her mother when they visited evin before, she could be humble when it was expedient."
18099,power,he was one of the many mullahs who had ascended to a position of great power thanks to old friendships.
18100,crime,“he has committed an extremely serious crime.” “serious?
18101,prisoner,"before parì had left the room, he had already turned to another prisoner’s file."
18102,justice,i couldn’t bear working for the ministry of justice after my demotion and i’d asked for an early pension.
18103,ordered,"a guard ordered parì to enter a square room, its windows coated by a layer of filth that had built up over the years, through which the sunlight barely passed; on the windowsill there was a vase of gray-orange plastic flowers."
18104,convict,"he was even thinner than before and he wore dirty convict overalls; his feet, in a shapeless pair of slippers, dragged across the ground."
18105,wall,"it was painful to look at him, but at least this time there was no wall between them, no gray curtain."
18106,guard,the guard stood next to them.
18107,guard,"“can you leave us alone?” “this isn’t your house,” responded the guard."
18108,wall,“we give the orders here.” he stepped a few feet back and leaned against the wall.
18109,crime,"he said that you should ask for forgiveness, because your crime is very serious.” he raised the corner of his mouth in a weary attempt at an ironic sneer."
18110,crime,"in no other country in the world is this a crime.” he spoke clearly, in a defiant tone, making certain that his words would be cleanly recorded by the microphone."
18111,freedom,"do you think there is freedom, or truth, in those pages?"
18112,evin,he had the same absent look as when he’d left evin the first time.
18113,torture,"“don’t you torture me, too.” at this point the guard went over to javad and made him stand up."
18114,guard,"“what did he mean?” the guard asked parì, when he returned."
18115,question,"“what?” the pasdar curtly repeated the question: “when he said ‘something warm.’ what was that supposed to mean?” if she hadn’t been behind the walls of a prison, beside a revolutionary guard, parì would have burst into laughter."
18116,question,"some heavy clothes.” she had to repeat the same thing to other, higher-ranked pas-daran who, after consulting with each other, kept asking her the same question, despite the fact that her response never changed."
18117,detained,"they thought that javad’s statement was some kind of code, and they detained her for two hours in the office."
18118,detainees,a couple of months later they removed javad from solitary isolation and led him into the courtyard with five other detainees.
18119,wall,two guards ordered them to line up against a wall.
18120,guard,twenty days later parì opened the door and found herself in front of a revolutionary guard.
18121,where,"if you follow this instruction, you will be told where the remains have been buried within a year from now."
18122,executed,"parì sat her mother down on the sofa in the living room and told her, without crying, that javad had been executed."
18123,prisoners,they were executing so many people that they couldn’t even figure out what possessions belonged to which prisoners.
18124,authorities,the authorities had sent her a backpack belonging to another man.
18125,prisoners,"just one week earlier, three thousand political prisoners had been killed."
18126,execution,"it wasn’t the first mass execution, and it wouldn’t be the last, but this recurrence of persecution had scared even some of the cleric’s supporters and functionaries."
18127,prisoner,the only response from the tribunal that had issued the death sentences was to affirm that every executed prisoner’s case had been examined by khomeini himself.
18128,law,"after more than ten years of patience and inactivity, i was able to return to my original passion: the law."
18129,lawyer,"i wouldn’t be a judge, of course, but at least i’d be a lawyer."
18130,law,i had just been awarded permission to practice law again.
18131,justice,my father had taught me about justice and fairness and i had passed the same values on to my daughters.
18132,law,"and so i returned to work, fighting like a bulldog—which is what they once called javad—to reclaim a small corner of the law."
18133,death,simin never recovered from javad’s death.
18134,war,"after the end of the war in july 1988, he had been rewarded for his services with commendations and medals, and they’d installed him in a government office, where he had a view of the entire city."
18135,wall,"on the wall there hung a gigantic portrait of khomeini, who had died before he could realize his dream of a united states of islam."
18136,war,"his one attempt to export the revolution had cost iran more years of war, and had cost alì his family."
18137,war,but there was something next to the portrait of khomeini that caught his attention—a painting of a violent war scene.
18138,death,everything that he believed in had collapsed with khomeini’s death.
18139,where,don’t you think you deserve to live in a place where happiness is possible?
18140,arrested,"what about her?” “her brother was arrested for belonging to the tudeh, too."
18141,suspect,"did they suspect him, too?” “i don’t know."
18142,state,the revolution has already torn apart so many families and has reduced the country to a state of exhaustion.
18143,execution,"after javad’s execution, they started to ostracize me."
18144,question,but there’s also the question of my colleagues.
18145,conviction,"she listened and nodded, though with little conviction."
18146,power,“i’ve been put in charge of the new power plant.
18147,situation,"you know i never wanted this job, but i thought that, given the situation in tehran, it might be better for all of us to leave town for a while.” i was dumbfounded."
18148,war,"ever since the war with iraq had broken out, the regime had fought relentlessly against editors, journalists, and writers—against anyone who could make their voice heard through the written word."
18149,war,and the situation didn’t improve after the war ended.
18150,situation,"the regime’s newspapers denigrated its members and the kayhan publication scornfully referred to us as “ancient café partisans.” this term, in vogue since the shah’s time, was an allusion to the refugees who discussed the miserable iranian political situation while lounging about in cafés, delighted by the sound of their own polemics."
18151,court,"someone tried to sue the newspapers for libel, but no court would take the case, and obviously no newspaper would publish the association’s responses or protests."
18152,death,"lying in full view, next to the body, was a bottle of liquor that was thought to be the cause of death."
18153,arrest,"the body of another translator, ghaffar hosseini, was discovered by his neighbors in an advanced stage of decomposition; cardiac arrest, concluded the doctor."
18154,police,a little while later several police cars arrived.
18155,state,"upon giving their statements, the victims were told not to say anything to anyone about their “accident.” after this episode, we all knew that death was following us like a shadow and we lived in a continuous state of alert."
18156,sentenced,the iranian authorities therefore formed a special operations team that was charged with secretly executing those who could no longer be publicly sentenced by the tribunals.
18157,death,"if the verdict was death, the special operations team—made up of agents trained in high-level military tactics, like bombing a  car moving at 130 kilometers an hour—got involved."
18158,conviction,"not only had they been trained in the use of sophisticated weapons, they also had a blind obedience to every law written in the name of islam, and the conviction that killing dissidents and dying for islam would open the doors of paradise for them."
18159,death,"even today, despite numerous theories, no one knows the names of the judges who signed those death warrants."
18160,where,"on august 6, 1991, shahpur bakhtyar, the last prime minister to be nominated by the shah before the revolution, was assassinated in his parisian residence, where he had lived with a security detail."
18161,police,"on august 9, 1992, the police discovered in bonn the dismembered body of ferydoon farrokhzad, a famous iranian showman and singer who was the brother of the famous poet forough farrokhzad."
18162,murder,at the murder scene they found a very large shirt that didn’t belong to the victim.
18163,crime,"following an investigation the german police concluded that the assassin, after having committed the crime, had probably decided to change into a new shirt."
18164,arrest,"the german police managed to arrest one of the attackers, an iranian."
18165,trial,the trial provoked major attention in newspapers and on television all over the world.
18166,sentence,"the attacker was given a life sentence, but the most significant finding of the case was that the person behind the assassination was the iranian minister of the interior, alì fallahian, who was then placed on an international most wanted list."
18167,crimes,"compared to the rest of the iranian clergy, he was considered a moderate, and brought about greater freedoms of expression, allowing the press, finally, to denounce the political crimes that had occurred."
18168,tortured,"on september 12, 1998, in kerman, the bodies of hamid haji-zadeh, a teacher and poet, and his son karoun, who was only nine years old, were found tortured and cut into pieces in their beds."
18169,trial,the eighteen members of the special operations team were arrested and put on trial.
18170,case,i represented the forouhar family in the case of the hezb-e mellat-e iran party secretary who had been assassinated along with his wife.
18171,trial,the trial created a huge uproar and the entire leadership of the ministry of public security and the secret services were forced to resign.
18172,sentenced,"but they were too important to be kept in prison; despite being sentenced to life, they were all pardoned and released."
18173,situation,"in 1992, when i was speaking with my husband in the kitchen, the seriousness of the situation was not yet clear and my only thought was that i didn’t want to be away from my friends."
18174,guilty,i felt terribly guilty about the idea of having to sacrifice my friendships just to live in a place that wasn’t so dangerous.
18175,court,"i began to fight back as if my husband were an adversary in court, knocking down every one of his arguments."
18176,situation,he was convinced that the situation had become too desperate.
18177,death,"by this point i’d learned how to recognize the envelopes, but even though i had a good idea of what they said, i opened each one, in the hope that i’d find some reason not to be afraid, that they weren’t in fact what they seemed to be: death threats."
18178,locked,"once more i’d have to be locked up at home with my books, unable even to see friends."
18179,guilt,i felt a deep sense of guilt as i hung up the phone.
18180,situation,by the beginning of june the situation became intolerable.
18181,law,"i was losing my father, my teacher, the guide who, since the beginning of my law career, had helped me to solve important problems that came up, while preventing me from committing the kinds of mistakes caused by inexperience."
18182,law,shirin!” shouted my brother-in-law.
18183,law,my brother-in-law gave me a sedative and my suffering ceased in a brief period of oblivion.
18184,locked,"for the next several months i locked myself in at home, refusing to see anybody."
18185,state,in this state it was impossible for me to return to the city where my husband had been working.
18186,abuse,in the late nineties i was invited to a seminar on child abuse that was being held at oxford university; i would speak about my work defending the rights of children in my country.
18187,locked,"i remained undecided for several days, then i thought back to our friendship, to her family, and the thing we had always said about her obstinate brothers—they had locked themselves in their cages."
18188,inside,"from the outside the house was as gray and dull as all the other houses in the neighborhood, but inside the rooms were illuminated with vivacious colors: curtains, rugs, and upholstery in every hue of orange and red, and a profusion of large, soft cushions covered the beds and couches."
18189,death,"“if you knew anything about art history, you’d know that, with few exceptions, artists become famous only after their death."
18190,death,you’ll see she’s wearing black in all the paintings made after her husband’s death.
18191,taken,"“how i missed you!” “after all the chic restaurants i’ve taken you to,” said parì, “have you no shame?” mcdonald’s actually had symbolic significance for us."
18192,chain,"in iran, after the islamic revolution, all of the chain restaurants had been closed, because they were considered a cornerstone of american culture."
18193,where,at first the people didn’t bother to protest: in every iranian city there were plenty of places where you could find better hamburgers.
18194,war,"i didn’t really want to ask her if we could eat at mcdonald’s, but i confessed my nostalgia for those years at the university, when we’d walk through the streets with books under our arms, chatting with each other and our fellow students; when a man was only able to have one wife, and the mullahs were merely religious figures; when we didn’t have to wear the veil, and there weren’t separate seats for women and men; when the  revolution, the war, our personal troubles were still distant, and it was normal to go to the movies, to have fun, sing and be happy."
18195,question,"i hesitated a moment before asking my question, but it was our last chance to break the silence of the last few years."
18196,situation,the situation at the university had become unsustainable.
18197,ordered,"soon after that, word went out that parì was promoting marxist teachings during her classes—despite the fact that she didn’t even teach classes anymore—and so the committee responsible for purging heretical professors ordered that she be fired."
18198,wall,her framed medical degree had been torn off the wall and was lying on her desk.
18199,police,but after two hours she decided that she still wasn’t ready to surrender: she marched determinedly to the nearest police station and reported the incident.
18200,police,the police inspected her clinic and took a statement.
18201,officers,the officers made no effort to calm her down and told her that it would be best for her to leave town.
18202,situation,"“do you want to?” “i’d like to very much,” she said, drying her tears, “but i’m in a delicate situation."
18203,where,i had no idea where he was going.
18204,death,"he said that after khomeini’s death, everything became corrupt and they lost sight of their goals."
18205,escaped,"anyway, it doesn’t matter anymore.” “at least he escaped in time.” “i hope you’re right."
18206,ordered,"parì was urgently asking for my help: one of the regime’s new, vast bureaucracies had ordered her to provide evidence that she still lived in tehran and, therefore, had the right to keep her property."
18207,case,"in her brother’s case, the government declared that it was authorized to confiscate all properties belonging to supporters of the shah; in parì’s case, the government would be taking possession of the property of an expatriated citizen."
18208,situation,the most amazing thing about the situation was the irrationality of the seizure process.
18209,state,that way they achieved their desired result—eviction—and at the same time allow the state to make the argument that this result could have been avoided.
18210,taken,"everything suggested a combination of poverty and decorum—except for the lovely geranium that peeked out from the windowsill, the petals of which brushed against a photo that must have been taken at least fifty years earlier, of a woman in a wedding dress."
18211,injustice,for him this was much more than an injustice.
18212,taken,in his eyes i could see that he had taken this as a personal failure.
18213,war,"the first of the five had been the victim of germ warfare during the iraq war, and was now in a vegetative state, living in a tehran rest home."
18214,imprisoned,the third had renounced his past and become a dissident; he had been imprisoned for a few articles he’d written that were critical of the regime.
18215,where,"the fourth had been elected to parliament, where he constantly fell asleep during the sessions and had no clout."
18216,state,"he seemed the very picture of an executive, a man responsible for administering the will of the state."
18217,crime,if you break any of these laws you are considered to have committed a crime and can be certain that you’ll be punished.
18218,possession,"parì had to transfer her property into the possession of someone she trusted, who then had to move into the apartment."
18219,lawyer,"i couldn’t believe it—here i was, a lawyer, and i hadn’t figured it out myself, while a man who spent all day caressing his tasbih had."
18220,law,"seeing how perplexed i was, akbar said, “every law has its unwritten clauses.” “i know.” “so you know that those unwritten clauses tell you how to bypass the law.” i wanted to object, but i nodded, conceding the argument."
18221,authorities,"i contacted the elderly cousin that we had chosen to take possession of her property and the two of us signed all of the necessary documents—the one intended for the authorities and the private one, for the two of them, that declared the apartment, and everything in it, belonged to parì and that the cousin had no other property rights."
18222,taken,"when i entered his office, akbar told me he’d learned, happily, that the apartment had been taken care of."
18223,where,“far be it for me to tell him where he should live.” akbar played with his tasbih.
18224,death,"he kept going on about how, after khomeini’s death, the islamic republic went off on the wrong path."
18225,inside,"but i’ll let you know what he says.” she called me a few weeks later to confirm that alì had no intention ever to step inside iran again, at least not while it was still an islamic republic."
18226,torture,"he said that he couldn’t give parì his telephone number or his address, because that would be dangerous for both of them, if they did try to torture her to get information."
18227,where,"then you visit relatives and friends, and the children visit the most elderly family members at their haft sin, where more blessings and gifts are exchanged."
18228,taken,"in those last relatively calm years before the deaths of abbas and javad, simin had taken to celebrating the third day of nowruz with a huge party at her house that quickly became a required stop for all of her friends and relatives."
18229,ordered,"the ritual began with her and parì going shopping: the two women visited all of their trusted stores and ordered lamb of the highest quality, chickens from the countryside, the whitest, finest rice, raisins, large grapes, almonds, and crunchy pistachios, and many pounds of tomatoes, celery, eggplants, fava beans, and peas."
18230,death,"after abbas’s death, simin gave up celebrating nowruz, using her heart attack as an excuse, and the large reunions at her home became a distant memory."
18231,authorities,"fortunately her return avoided any conflict, and there were no problems with the authorities."
18232,ordered,"following simin’s example, she ordered enough food for a feast and spent almost a week cleaning, reorganizing the apartment, cooking, and reorganizing again."
18233,wall,photographs of hossein and simin hung on the wall in silver frames.
18234,death,"she always told me, ‘parì, i don’t want the door to my home to be shut after my death."
18235,charge,"“congratulations on the prize,” she said, immediately taking charge of the conversation."
18236,authorities,"we’ve already made a formal request to the authorities, but no one has bothered to give us any response.” behnaz’s eyes were fixed on mine."
18237,authority,obviously the same authority figures who had ordered those people’s deaths—and who were reluctant even to allow them proper burials— would never allow such a monument to be erected at a mass grave.
18238,lawyer,"i felt, as a lawyer, that i should tell my client this, but i wondered how best to convey myself."
18239,injustice,"then i thought of javad, his impudent smile and dark, luminous eyes, and of abbas, the victim of an equal, but different, injustice."
18240,taken,"in reality, she’d taken her grief and her nostalgia with her; it was only that in london she couldn’t give voice to all of those feelings."
18241,power,"here, in tehran, the past had returned with all its power; she had the same sad, proud look in her eyes as behnaz."
18242,authorities,"i said simply, “i don’t have a good relationship with the authorities."
18243,where,"i stayed alone in my office, arranging the large basket of roses and carnations, wondering where all of this would lead."
18244,authorities,"but seeing that the authorities didn’t allow the planting of flowers to be used as a memorial to the dead in khavaran, it seemed right to honor them with something else: a monument."
18245,arrest,“what happens if they arrest me?” she asked.
18246,torture,they could torture me.” i understood where this was coming from—i was well aware that her visits to javad had left an indelible mark on her.
18247,where,there was a quiet restaurant where we often went to escape from our routine and from the oppressive climate of the capital.
18248,inside,the air in tehran is so dirty that about sixty days a year the government releases advisories cautioning children and the elderly to stay inside their homes.
18249,arrested,"at dinner, we discussed parì’s concern that she might be arrested at the airport."
18250,cellular,he reached into his pocket and pulled out his cellular phone.
18251,cell,"are you giving me a present?” this was his plan: since a cell phone could pick up voices even if it laid tucked inside a handbag, parì could take it with her to the airport, and call us as soon as she got close to the passport control."
18252,cell,she only worried about the cell phone.
18253,cell,"and a generous one, too: though he pretended it didn’t matter, a week without his cell phone was no small thing to him."
18254,cell,"then she rested the cell phone in her bag and i waited, listening."
18255,cell,then the rustling sound of the cell phone jostling in the bottom of the handbag.
18256,awaiting,"six hours later the points of jack’s mustache peeked out from the crowd awaiting arriving flights at heathrow, and he brought her home safely."
18257,arrested,suddenly i was alarmed: perhaps our trick had been discovered and they’d arrested her at the airport.
18258,executed,"if only i’d figured out sooner that she’d been abducted, i could’ve intervened before they executed her, but now i had no idea where she might be or how to find her."
18259,question,"then the secretary responded that she first had to understand exactly what my question was; if it contributed to the common good, she would connect me to the appropriate department."
18260,case,"in any case, she said, the mayor was not available to see me."
18261,where,"next i went to the ministry of the interior, where an employee told me what i already knew, which is that the issue pertained to the department of city planning and that i should inquire there."
18262,city council,they told me that my request was still being processed by the city council and that i needed to wait three more days for their response.
18263,state,"ahmadinejad looked for any excuse to start a conflict with the west; for example, one of the first things he said after his presidential inauguration was that the state of israel must be “wiped off the face of the earth.” as tehran’s mayor a man like him would never agree to meet me."
18264,fugitive,"28 the paris sky  alì was adjusting to his new life, even though it felt incomplete—he lived like a fugitive, and felt constantly on edge."
18265,law,"he had studied french for long enough to gain admittance to a law school, and moved to paris."
18266,bastille,"alì had run into him one day in the place de la bastille—or more precisely on a small side street, lined with restaurants, where he’d decided to splurge on a nice lunch."
18267,where,"finally, after a momentary hesitation, he recognized alì and invited him to his table, where he was drinking an orange juice."
18268,where,"then again, i’ve changed names so many times that i don’t even remember what i’m supposed to call myself now.” he had lived for a year and a half in spain, where he worked as a waiter in a popular restaurant, and for the past five months he’d been in paris under a new identity."
18269,fugitive,"alì felt relieved; seeing an old friend who, like him, was living as a fugitive."
18270,building,"about a week before my conversation with jack, siamak had gone to visit alì at his pension, greeted the old woman who lived on the first floor of the building, walked up to the third floor, and knocked on the door, using the agreed-upon code."
18271,case,"“your brother left me your number, saying that i should call you in case of an emergency.” parì didn’t know who it was, she’d never heard this voice before, but in her mind’s eye she immediately  pictured a small old woman with a slow gait and a sympathetic face, just as alì had described the proprietor of the pension."
18272,police,she had let the police open the door.
18273,state,"parì thanked the woman and hung up, cutting off her confused explanations and apologies for the state of her health, heart, nerves."
18274,death,"she thought no one could feel so resigned to death, unless she had died many times already."
18275,police,a few days later the police put together the facts.
18276,building,when she left the building she was swallowed by a fog that covered the entire city.
18277,arrest,"she squinted, and remembered when she told alì the news of javad’s arrest."
18278,death,“lots of brave soldiers risk death every day on the front.
18279,death,her friends and relatives had recently found out about alì’s death and the thought of yet another wrenching loss hung over us like a shadow.
18280,death,you should at least know his true assassin: the islamic republic.” then she told the story of his death.
18281,wall,i was facing the wall where the family portraits hung.
18282,wall,“the wall is full.
18283,where,"let’s hope no one else dies: i wouldn’t know where to put another photo,” said parì quietly."
18284,lawyer,"“so, miss lawyer, i’ve noticed that there’s still no monument."
18285,injustice,"he had said, “if you can’t eliminate injustice, at least tell everyone about it.” we couldn’t build a monument to the memory of javad and those who, like him, were victims of the regime."
18286,injustice,they were victims of equal injustice.
18287,poverty,shahin: a life of wealth and poverty  4.
18288,sink,"— saadi, translated by m. aryanpoor      1   reflections   rubber gloves, a sink full of suds, a pile of dirty dishes."
18289,hole,"the eyes look deep into my soul, and i am reminded that despite the warmth of my family around me there is still a hole in my life."
18290,inside,"bring your face closer so i can kiss you.’  i leant closer and, crying inside myself, said, ‘i love you, nana-gha."
18291,imprisoned,you are imprisoned.
18292,inside,"and inside yourself you may become dead.’  she was no longer looking at me, but staring straight up, in her own world."
18293,poverty,poverty.
18294,taken,"my mother always believed that this was because she had taken her baby outside in the middle of a very cold winter, with much snow all around; it was only for a few minutes but long enough for the child to catch a bad cold from which she never recovered."
18295,death,"after each death shahin would cry and cry, but asghar showed no empathy."
18296,death,"conditions like neonatal jaundice, which rarely if ever lead to death in modern times, often caused infant mortality."
18297,death,"after the third death, laya and shahin travelled with aboo, laya’s third husband, and two neighbours to mashhad, an ancient and spiritual city in the far north-east of iran."
18298,taken,"the next advice offered to shahin came from a neighbour, who declared that her wedding to asghar had not taken place at a ‘good’ hour."
18299,where,"from the gardens of the hospital where she worked, she collected khorfeh (purslane), a slippery, tasteless, wild vegetable."
18300,building,the building had been designed and built by my father and was jointly owned by him and ahmad.
18301,building,"middle class iranian architecture can be quite restrained, largely because heavy concrete bricks are used as the main building material."
18302,inside,"rendered inside in white, both levels were divided down the middle, from front to back, by wide, tiled hallways."
18303,where,"this tragedy weighed heavily on the whole family, with everyone blaming themselves for not knowing where zari was."
18304,where,"they went to the orphanage, where all the children had shaved heads and identical jackets."
18305,toilet,"notwithstanding aboo’s promises, and though he cared for his adopted daughter, it was my mother and laya who took on most of the work of looking after this tiny child who was not yet toilet trained, was painfully shy and had clearly been neglected."
18306,abuse,soosan would stay in our household for seven years before my uncle ahmad grew tired of the abuse that she was suffering and decided she should return to an orphanage.
18307,where,after numerous enquiries to orphanages and government departments i discovered where she was and drove to see her.
18308,death,~  with the death of zari i was shahin’s only surviving child until my brother hossein was born (healthy) two years later.
18309,taken,"the next day, four months after soraya had become sick and my mother had first taken her to see a doctor, soraya died."
18310,toilet,years later my mother told me that she felt like a toilet into which asghar would empty himself.
18311,term,"four months into her term, she decided to abort the pregnancy, remembering that laya had told her once that she could use ‘date grass’ – a tough, dark green grass with wood-like blades about 15 centimetres long – if ever she wanted to do this."
18312,transferred,ahmad was a paramedic and captain in the army and had been transferred to a base in the city of kermanshah for a few years.
18313,where,"that evening when asghar arrived home he said, ‘where are you?"
18314,sentence,"to which he would reply, ‘so what?’  it was strange to hear my father speaking softly as he always spoke at a high volume during the day, usually with swear words laced through every sentence."
18315,taken,"occasionally all the bedding would be taken to a man called a panbeh zan, or ‘cotton beater’, for refreshing and cleaning; when they came back they felt soft and smelt lovely and clean."
18316,wall,"the only other thing on the wall would be a free calendar that my father was given each year, probably by a supplier."
18317,wall,"uncle ahmad, his wife mahin and two of their sons had the same amount of space as we did, but a wall had been built, dividing it into two separate rooms."
18318,wall,"it had side tables and a dining table and chairs, and was nicely decorated with vases and fresh flowers and pictures on the wall."
18319,taken,i was just as taken by froozan’s daughter as i was by her.
18320,wall,~  across the hall from my family in the basement of the takht-e tavoos were two rooms: the space was identical in proportion to ours but a wall divided it into two separate rooms.
18321,wall,so they knocked down the wall and window and replaced them with that large roller door.
18322,power,"one of the men turned off the power at the switchboard, drenching the scene in almost total darkness."
18323,where,"amazingly, there was not a lot of heat damage as, for all the noise and acrid smoke, the fire itself had mainly been contained to the bench where it had started."
18324,wall,he had a ladder and stuck two sheets of paint swatches high on the wall.
18325,nazi,"my cousin nazi and i were watching him, fascinated by similar swatches spread around the floor."
18326,wall,he asked us if we wanted to see the colours on the wall.
18327,nazi,afterwards he did the same thing with nazi.
18328,poverty,"3   shahin: a life of wealth and poverty   my mother’s mother was alam-taj, the daughter of a well-connected craftsman and furniture maker, eisa khan."
18329,roads,"she and alam-taj went to live with fatemeh’s sister robabeh, who was also from a wealthy background, having married a high-ranking government official in the ministry for roads (razarat-e rah)."
18330,where,"alam-taj soon became pregnant and, with her husband, moved back to her father’s house where she would be able to receive a high standard of medical attention."
18331,poverty,"because it did not stop him working, the family weren’t driven into abject poverty, but it did mean that he was laissez faire in ways that held the family back."
18332,death,"invited by some neighbours, she attended taziyeh, a traditional persian passion play about the life and death of husayn, grandson of the prophet mohammed."
18333,where,sometimes she stayed at farzaneh’s home where she did some housework and helped with younger children.
18334,where,"once they took her to café majles, where only the elite gathered."
18335,building,"eventually we turned off the road and drove through two enormous wrought iron gates, down the main driveway and onto a large circular drive, stopping in front of a vast building that i would soon learn was the main house."
18336,where,"walking through the front door, i didn’t know where to look."
18337,taken,"today i can look at pictures of the sa’ad abad palace (the home of qajar monarchs and 20th century shahs) with its sparkling, mirror-lined pillars, walls and ceilings, and its glistening chandeliers, and i am taken back to this room at golnar’s house."
18338,inside,melahat told me it was hardly ever used as they had baths inside.
18339,building,"it was near another building, oval in shape, which was where melahat and her siblings had their rooms."
18340,building,"one of my most vivid memories of this building was of the bathrooms, which smelt rich with the fragrance of soaps and perfumes."
18341,building,for the same reason i always allowed melahat to take the lead in how we spent our time – going through her wardrobes or wandering the grounds or visiting the kitchen or another room or building.
18342,case,in any case i eventually realised that intellectually at least we were on a par.
18343,taken,"sometimes at the end of staying over with melahat, i would be taken home in one of hadi and golnar’s two cadillacs."
18344,serving,"also collected were a samovar, a tea set, two bowls, a set of plates, a large serving dish, a cooking pot."
18345,case,"my mother never forgot that there were no coloured lights decorating the venue, as was normally the case at an iranian wedding, the lights being an indicator of the happiness in the air."
18346,locked,"shahin remembered only one time when she and asghar went out together, to the cinema, after which laya locked them out of their yard."
18347,gate,asghar was forced to jump over the gate so that they could get in and go to bed.
18348,where,‘where are you going?’ said laya.
18349,law,‘what does your daughter-in-law think she is doing touching my radio?’ he said.
18350,where,she retreated to her bed where she cried and cried.
18351,toilet,"their room measured two by three metres and, like all the other houses in ghal-e, it had no electricity or running water; they used a toilet shared with seven other similar ‘homes’, including laya’s."
18352,taken,"in poor health and with no income, alam-taj was again taken into the care of her aunt robabeh."
18353,where,"the two women had great respect and love for each other – while bickering often – and lived out their days in a single room with almost no belongings, conditions a long way from where either of them had started."
18354,sentences,i remember him laboriously writing words onto a sheet of paper as my mother dictated simple sentences.
18355,transferred,"for the last two years of primary school a number of the girls, including me, transferred to a smaller all-girls school."
18356,situation,"this was the perfect situation for shahin to demonstrate her determined side; while my mother was often reserved and always reticent about causing trouble or inconvenience to anyone, when it came to pursuing opportunities for her children to have a better life than her own she became a tigress."
18357,case,"she went to work, begging the school’s principal to give me a place and even visiting the ministry for education to argue her case."
18358,question,it was best not to question.
18359,where,"to get to the shops shahin needed to walk back to takht-e tavoos, near our old house, where there was a bus station."
18360,where,"groups of boys dressed in floral shirts and flared jeans would whistle at us from where they sat on the bonnet of a bmw, or hoot their horn as they cruised slowly by in a red mini minor, setting us off into giggles."
18361,inside,"just as we reached the car and were about to get inside, a voice at our backs turned us to ice."
18362,where,"with wide eyes, elahe slunk away from the car and over to where he stood."
18363,where,i would walk the rest of the way to our old house where laya was still living; i sometimes stayed with her for a night or two.
18364,where,no one in the car said another word before the boys let me out where i asked them to and then drove away.
18365,escaped,back at school i discovered that elahe had escaped with nothing more than a stern talking to.
18366,situation,"shahnaz was the couple’s only child – a rare situation in iran at this time – and she would often tell me how much she was loved, though only now, in her home, did i get a true sense of what she meant by this."
18367,where,"together you are like two mermaids.’  shahnaz asked where her mother was, and was answered by mrs shirazi’s voice coming from her bedroom."
18368,where,eventually mrs shirazi came out to the sitting room where by now all of us girls were gathered.
18369,where,"‘please don’t,’ i said, then dropped my head, having no idea where the courage had come from to say that."
18370,inside,it wasn’t me who spoke up – it was someone else speaking from a place deep inside me.
18371,inside,i churned inside.
18372,inside,"and i realised how submissive my mother was, yet how she retained, inside her, a strength that my father could not sense and would never break."
18373,roads,"the roads were not good and the journey took around eight hours, yet my father, sitting in the comfortable driver’s seat, refused to stop unless absolutely necessary."
18374,law,"he takes his wife and his brother-in-law with him but drops his mother in the centre of the street,’ she sneered when she arrived home."
18375,offence,"my father took offence when he overheard pooran’s elderly mother say, ‘happy me that i don’t have a donkey and don’t know how much hay a donkey eats.’ in other words, she was glad it was not her who had to worry about all these extra mouths."
18376,hole,"she had fallen into a dry metre-deep hole on the pavement, completely (and typically) unguarded and unmarked."
18377,situation,study would also give me time away from home and help me forget the realities of my mother’s situation.
18378,where,"where our family were probably regarded as a bit chaotic in takht-e tavoos, what with zari’s drowning, the garage fire and asghar’s taxi business operating at all hours, after a few years in the manb-e abb house we were now well regarded."
18379,where,"he asked shahin where she had been, and while she tried to hide it, it wasn’t long before he worked out what she had been doing."
18380,law,"i took a bus to the suburb of gholhak, in the north of tehran, where my uncle ahmad’s brother-in-law hormoz worked at a branch of the post office."

18383,building,the computer department shared a building with the administration section on one side of the site.
18384,building,the iranian gate was some distance from my building whereas the american gate was right beside it.
18385,gate,"(sometimes in winter, when i was running late, the guard on the american gate would kindly let me in.)"
18386,authority,"nothing changed, of course, and eventually i learnt that the commander wasn’t actually very senior, despite appearances, and had no authority to make decisions."
18387,guilty,"i also played a lot of solitaire on my computer, feeling guilty at times about earning a good salary for what felt like minimal work."
18388,case,"in contrast, we iranians did not have a uniform which, in my case, meant wearing attractive clothing most of the time."
18389,guard,"in persian, the man said he was a guard and that we should terminate our conversation immediately."
18390,serving,i bought serving dishes and crockery.
18391,where,"(my mother would later bring one of these sets to australia, where i still have it.)"
18392,where,"eventually elahe and her partner arrived and we drove up into the hills to their home in pune, a couple of hours from bombay, where i spent a beautiful month."
18393,death,"the crowd is pushed tightly together and everyone is pumping their right fist in the air as they shout ‘death to america’ over and over again, loudly and in unison."
18394,building,near the us embassy we would get off the bus and follow the crowd to the front of the embassy building.
18395,death,‘death to america!
18396,death,death to america!
18397,death,death to america!’ over and over.
18398,situation,it is important to understand that this was not an unusual situation for an iranian household.
18399,police,we were living under a leader who had used a secret police force (known as savak) to suppress dissent and who had presided over an increasing gap between the broad population and an ever-smaller trusted elite.
18400,freedom,"without political freedom, we had not even the faintest idea of what it would be to live in a democracy."
18401,state,one of our friends came to our house in a very excited state.
18402,power,"the government of prime minister shapour bakhtiar, with the support of the imperial army, held on to the remnants of power for only a few weeks, despite bakhtiar being well liked by the general population."
18403,term,"use of this term is also a sign of respect, and as such i prefer not to apply it to khomeini, a man who became responsible for the deaths of a great many iranians.)"
18404,imprisonment,"while my family were still ambivalent about the shah’s departure and the revolution as a whole, i do remember a nagging sense of comfort that perhaps this would also be the end of savak and the constant unspoken fear that to do or say something against the government would lead to imprisonment or worse."
18405,justice,as a student in the 1940s he had become a champion of the poor and an advocate for a traditional form of islam with an emphasis on social justice.
18406,jailed,"as a teacher, he spoke out against the excesses of the iranian monarchy; this led to his being jailed for eight months in 1952."
18407,jailed,"he was jailed again in 1964 and in 1972, then placed under house arrest."
18408,where,"in 1977 he was released and travelled to london, where he died soon afterwards of an apparent heart attack."
18409,freedom,"shariati was idolised by educated young iranians, particularly university students, who were disenfranchised by the shah and the lack of political freedom imposed by his rule."
18410,guard,we had no understanding then of what real democracy is or how to guard our personal freedoms.
18411,arrest,there was an enormous sense of excitement at these meetings – simply the freedom to hold a meeting without the risk of arrest was something new to us.
18412,power,"the removal of the shah from power had brought an end to hundreds of years of rule by monarchy, and an end to autocracy (if only briefly)."
18413,hole,"i clearly remember that the woman had a chamber pot for a toilet, and there was a hole in the bed to access it."
18414,poverty,yet for most people in my class this poverty was invisible.
18415,freedom,"it was originally called shahyad (meaning ‘remembrance of the shahs’) but was renamed azadi square (‘freedom square’, somewhat ironically) after the revolution."
18416,state,"the kurds are an ethnic people who have no official state of their own but whose traditional homeland, kurdistan, occupies an area around the border regions of northern iraq, south-eastern turkey and north-western iran."
18417,war,"at regular intervals over hundreds of years, ordinary kurds have had to escape oppression or war."
18418,war,war has taken everything from us.
18419,camp,for the next few weeks i stopped at the camp for a couple of hours after work each day and taught about a dozen young children their alphabet.
18420,camp,"while waiting for a taxi outside the camp after my teaching one evening, a black bmw pulled up and the man inside offered to drive me home."
18421,camp,from then on khosro kept coming to the camp quite often to help with my teaching and to drive me home.
18422,camp,not everything worked out at the camp as i had imagined – perhaps not surprising as i had dived in without completely thinking it through.
18423,camp,this was brought home to me all of a sudden on the day i arrived at the camp to be greeted by glares from one of the women.
18424,state,"after returning to iran, khomeini moved quickly to take advantage of the strong national sentiment against the shah and towards his idea of an islamic state."
18425,establishment,"in a referendum on 31 march 1979, over 98 per cent of voters supported the establishment of iran as an ‘islamic republic’."
18426,question,"the question put was a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, with no explanation of what ‘islamic republic’ would mean."
18427,state,the widespread lack of political awareness meant that few people thought to question this; most people had no idea that khomeini’s islamic state would turn out to be very different to anything they had imagined.
18428,prisoners,"iranians wanted freedom of the press, separation of the judiciary from the executive arm of government, a democratically elected parliament and an end to political prisoners."
18429,law,"liberty, human rights and the rule of law."
18430,sharia,what we got was a plague of theocracy and sharia law.
18431,state,"shariati advocated islam, after all, and we were now living in an islamic state."
18432,police,"i decided to keep my distance and follow to see where the girls were taken, which was an office of the komiteh, a sort of secret police also established by the new regime."
18433,freedom,"we learnt later that the girls were released, but it was the first sign that perhaps our new freedom would be short lived."
18434,law,"ultimately the protests were in vain, the wearing of a veil becoming law later in 1980."
18435,power,khomeini had come to power on a lie: a promise to remove the suppression that had been imposed by the shah.
18436,freedom,"instead of providing freedom he had done the opposite, replacing the shah’s rule with a much more oppressive and violent regime which continues to rule iran."
18437,police,"but any notion of free expression had been extinguished on that night in shoosh square, when what ensued proved to me that i did not have the bravery to pursue ‘counter-revolutionary type’ aims against a new secret police or army."
18438,murder,"it was all just a distraction from the real injustice that was going on – the murder of thousands of people including army officers, perceived opponents of the new regime and sympathisers of the previous one, including actors, artists and journalists."
18439,building,"i’m not sure that i ever understood precisely why we were doing what we did, but i spent several weeks of spare time at a department of health building close to central tehran."
18440,case,"but in my case my family background – in which, as we have seen, women were entirely subordinate – combined with a national culture in which young people were not encouraged to pursue their interests, and even if they wanted to, opportunities were limited."
18441,building,"coincidentally, the building in which we sorted medicines was also, at the time, the home of the australian embassy."
18442,where,"the more i thought about it, the clearer i was that australia was where i wanted to go."
18443,where,where i would go.
18444,situation,"he had a good education, and i could study some more and get my own phd; we could create a good situation together."
18445,building,~  by now i was living in an apartment in the building next door to my parents’ house – the one they had bought as an investment some time before.
18446,building,i used the upper storey of the two-level building.
18447,situation,but it was clear that this man did not want to appear to be taking any advantage of this situation.
18448,case,"although every iranian home would have ja namaz even if, as in our case, it is not used, reza’s action was a little surprising – it is rare for iranians to pray when visiting."
18449,case,"in any case, i had no idea what ‘love’ was supposed to look or feel like."
18450,law,"reza would come in a car with his brother-in-law mahmood to pick me up at noon, and we would drive the half an hour or so to karaj."
18451,law,"when they arrived a young boy, the brother- in-law’s son, was also with them."
18452,law,i immediately asked the brother-in-law to pull over.
18453,inside,i went inside and chose the largest arrangement of flowers that i could.
18454,case,"normally in a case like this, reza would bring the flowers as he was the male guest."
18455,where,"this was where reza’s parents lived; his father had been born in nishapur, 300 kilometres further east."
18456,law,they all kept saying how happy they were that i was to be their future sister-in-law.
18457,stir,"i wondered if reza might turn over and kiss me goodnight, but he did not stir."
18458,arrested,"at one point along the way – it seemed to be the middle of nowhere – our bus was stopped by members of the pasdaran, the same revolutionary guard that had arrested my friends in shoosh square a year or so before."
18459,taken,"they told us to get into one of a number of jeeps they had with them; we would be taken down the road to the komiteh station, which turned out to be nothing more than an abandoned house with no water and a number of broken windows."
18460,taken,"my bag was taken and searched, and i was relieved when the guard failed to find, at the bottom, a newspaper of the mek, a group that opposed the new regime."
18461,illegal,"while not yet illegal, having a newspaper like this among my belongings would not have been looked on positively by the pasdaran."
18462,guard,eventually the pasdaran guard ran out of questions.
18463,case,"i always felt i could argue my case with the pasdaran, but i wasn’t so sure about how my father would take finding out that i had been travelling with reza before we were engaged."
18464,authority,"it was the sort of lie that we were increasingly becoming accustomed to telling people in authority – anything to turn their attention to somewhere or someone else, as we were not protected by the rule of law."
18465,law,"finally, the officer had to believe my mother when she assured him that reza was her future son-in-law."
18466,building,the whole building shook.
18467,where,people who had been walking around froze where they were.
18468,state,everyone in the computer department seemed to be in a state of shock.
18469,where,"we were too frightened to go outside, but too scared to stay where we were as well."
18470,where,"it was one of those rare situations where rather than keeping to themselves, everyone was talking."
18471,inside,when i got home i rushed inside and told my mother to turn on the radio.
18472,war,‘there is a war!
18473,war,‘war?
18474,war,what war?’  ‘turn on the radio.
18475,war,the airport was bombed and we were dismissed early.’  we soon heard a formal announcement that iraq had attacked iran and we were now at war.
18476,taken,"there are some parallels with the at times violent disagreements between catholic and protestant christians that have taken place, especially in northern ireland, with many on both sides not really understanding why or what they are fighting – only that they are fighting ‘the other’."
18477,war,this particular war would continue for the next eight years and result in the death or injury of over a million people; there are still many crippled men leading difficult lives today as a result.
18478,war,the eventual peace agreement reverted the iran–iraq border to exactly what it had been before the war.
18479,war,"if anything, the only ‘achievement’ was to further entrench the khomeini regime due to the rise in nationalism that always accompanies a war."
18480,war,"at times it felt like we were living in a world war ii movie as air raid sirens would go off, sending us into shelters."
18481,power,"my father took a small oil lamp, which worried me a lot – power was cut off in the city if incoming iraqi aircraft were detected and i was concerned that a pilot might be guided by this tiny light."
18482,war,"however, as reza had not seen a lot of his family since returning from australia, he spent the early months of the war in karaj with his sister."
18483,case,"and in any case, he had nowhere to stay in tehran – staying with us for a length of time while we were engaged would not have been appropriate."
18484,war,"being busy helped me block the war out of my mind, safe in the knowledge that soon i would be leaving iran."
18485,case,"and, in my case, i would also go to australia."
18486,question,"it seemed to be something about english language tuition rather than chemistry, but i didn’t question its value."
18487,building,"it is quite a grand building and was regarded as an excellent hotel at the time, though probably not quite five star."
18488,case,and in many respects this was the case for me.
18489,where,"i detested smoking anywhere, but especially in my bedroom where i knew the smell of nicotine would get into all my rugs and the satin quilt and silk curtains."
18490,charged,"however, after living my childhood in an atmosphere charged with yelling, i was not in the mood to argue with my new husband so soon."
18491,question,initially i tried to avoid the question but he persisted.
18492,suspect,"i don’t know whether he did or not, but i suspect he did, as he was a good man."
18493,where,finally it was time for the cashier to close his office – at this time they only opened when a plane arrived – which left us stranded in the transit lounge where we spent most of the night.
18494,where,"we flew to singapore where, finally, reza received a temporary visa allowing him to enter australia for three months."
18495,where,"instead of flying straight to australia, we decided to try bangkok, where there was an iranian embassy."
18496,where,"as soon as we had checked in and reza had had a chance to buy his cigarettes, we took a taxi to the local australian embassy where my tourist visa application was again declined."
18497,where,"‘where else would we go?’  ‘i thought we might go to a hotel.’  ‘no, it would be better if we went to shakoor’s.’  okay, i thought."
18498,taken,"this inconsistency was like a red flag to the official, and we were immediately taken to separate rooms to be interviewed and have our bags checked."
18499,situation,i was never so thankful that i was able to speak english and could explain our situation.
18500,term,"it is an odd persian custom for those with a qualification to be referred to by their title rather than their name, and i had some small pride in using this term in relation to my husband."
18501,officers,"we caught a taxi into central melbourne and on the way i said to reza, ‘you know, the customs officers took that silk carpet.’  ‘really?’  a deep frown crossed his face."
18502,where,"another time we visited latrobe university, where reza said he had been studying."
18503,where,"after the interview i crossed the road to the park, where reza stood waiting for me, smoking."
18504,where,‘where are you going?
18505,where,that is where the australian prostitutes go’.
18506,guilty,"i felt shocked and guilty, my mother’s words – ‘don’t do something you have to apologise for’ – coming to mind."
18507,case,i’d had no interest in cooking in iran and in any case had not needed to as my mother cooked almost everything.
18508,exercise,"when we did have intercourse, perhaps only twice a year, it was a purely mechanical exercise, much as i had seen my parents perform in the gloom of the takht-e tavoos basement."
18509,guilty,the kettle that you want.’  immediately i felt incredibly guilty.
18510,guilt,it took some days for this guilt to subside.
18511,ordered,"reza ordered a taxi and we left for queen victoria hospital in melbourne at seven in the morning; reza sat in the front, i sat in the back."
18512,ward,i had not yet had any contractions so was taken upstairs to a ward.
18513,ward,"he held our baby and said, ‘ali, my son.’  when i was back in the ward reza went out to the myer department store and came back with an expensive-looking pram – navy blue, with large wheels – and a soft-toy koala."
18514,where,"a thick layer of dust coated everything except the couch, where reza had obviously spent most of the last two weeks."
18515,sink,"not only was all our crockery dirty, but it was all over the house – hardly a dish had found its way to the kitchen sink."
18516,where,it took a week before i got the house back to where it had started – it was nowhere near perfect but at least it was liveable again.
18517,exercise,"once a day, for about 15 minutes, reza would exercise: standing upright, holding his arms out to his sides and then repeatedly pumping his forearms up into a classic bodybuilder pose and back."
18518,exercise,"he did not use any weights, but somehow this single exercise, along with a diet of mostly salad and very few baked goods, was enough to keep him in shape."
18519,where,"‘iran – that is where you should go next,’ he said."
18520,where,he rarely left the house and when he did he never told me where he was going.
18521,building,"ali was my priority now, along with building a family life with my husband."
18522,case,"in any case, there had not been so much yelling or swearing lately; a lack of yelling and swearing was what i now understood as being as close to love and kindness as i would get from this man."
18523,war,"as well, iran was expensive – the iran–iraq war was still being fought at this time."
18524,where,"instead of flying straight home to melbourne, we once again flew to bangkok, where we expected to be able to work things out quickly as we had last time."
18525,situation,‘what is the situation?’ i finally asked reza one day as he sprawled in his chair.
18526,slam,"as tears started to well in my eyes, i looked back to see reza, at full height, step back and slam the door."
18527,case,"the indignity would be unbearable, and in any case i had no money."
18528,where,"as i prepared to go out, reza asked me where i was going."
18529,serving,"though our hotel was very basic, it was in the area of a number of high class hotels, and there were many beautiful jewellery and gift shops serving their european and american guests."
18530,building,"‘get fucked,’ he said, and stormed out of the building."
18531,taken,the day before i had taken ali to a doctor.
18532,freed,i felt like i had been freed from prison.
18533,inside,"returning home shortly afterwards, and not having a house key with me, i knocked on the door for reza to let us inside."
18534,taken,"he was very disappointed that not one lead had come from this long trip, especially after he had paid for all our travel and our hotel in bangkok, not to mention the effort he had taken to help us get our visas."
18535,inside,"inscribed on the inside cover were the words: ‘a present by mr ali on mother’s day for his kind and dear mother, darling sohila."
18536,suspect,i suspect he gambled any ‘profits’ away as quickly as they were earned.
18537,abuse,(i didn’t tell fariba about what was happening either – reza’s abuse of me was something i had to manage on my own.)
18538,term,"over the coming years he would use the term more and more, many times a day."
18539,case,this was the case even though we were still temporary residents.
18540,law,"fariba also said nothing, in keeping with the respect (at least outwardly) that she, and mansoor, always showed their brother-in-law, in keeping with persian tradition."
18541,civil rights,you are very lucky to have come to a country that values civil rights.’  again i said nothing.
18542,power,"in my mind, reza still had all the power in our relationship."
18543,law,"i had no familiarity with australian law, certainly no understanding that i had some rights of my own."
18544,case,"i thought simply that if he wanted to take ali and leave me behind, he could do so, as would have been the case in iran."
18545,custody,"divorce in khomeini’s iran was nearly always initiated by the male, and nearly always resulted in the male being granted most of the possessions and custody of any children."
18546,law,this is what had happened to a sister-in-law of mine.
18547,law,similarly i didn’t understand that reza’s violence toward me was against the law.
18548,murdering,"in iran he could have done almost whatever he liked with me, short of murdering me, and he would always remain above the law."
18549,case,"in any case, i would never press the point for fear of having him lose his temper or, worse, leaving me and taking ali with him."
18550,situation,"~  despite my salary, our financial situation hardly improved."
18551,where,"in late january 1985, just a few weeks after ali’s third birthday, i confronted reza once again about his gambling and where all our money was going."
18552,taken,"if not for ali, divorce would have been the sweetest word to my ears, but i was terrified by the prospect of having my son taken away from me."
18553,where,reza went off to the men’s bathroom while ali and i moved to the platform where our train was about to leave.
18554,where,"the doors closed and, as the train drew away, i caught a glimpse of reza coming down the ramp onto the platform, scanning ahead to where he obviously expected to see me waiting for him."
18555,where,the take-away store where mansoor worked was nearby so we went to see him.
18556,where,however reza knew where that was.
18557,where,"all of us were soon on a train back into central melbourne, where we learnt that due to a strike the overnight train to canberra was not running."
18558,where,"we took a room in a small hostel across the road from the bus station, where i wept all night."
18559,where,we had no choice but to return to melbourne where mansoor and i at least had some work.
18560,where,"it was bad enough that reza knew where i worked, and i was shaking when i returned to the wool corporation the next day, leaving ali with fariba and mansoor at the hostel."
18561,where,‘where is ali?
18562,where,"worried that he would cause a scene at my workplace, i told him about the hostel and where it was."
18563,taken,"drawn by the fear of ali being taken from me, i followed."
18564,taken,what if reza had taken ali?
18565,where,‘where will you go?’ i stammered.
18566,where,"‘where will you take ali?’  ‘i take ali,’ was all he said."
18567,where,"from this point on, reza started sleeping in our spare bedroom where there was less chance of his being disturbed in the mornings; ali and i slept in the main bedroom."
18568,situation,"apart from the change in sleeping arrangements, i was now left with my old self in my old situation, the ‘new’ sohila having been nothing but a fleeting fantasy."
18569,state,my state of pride and perfection and patience and tolerance is broken.
18570,where,where is the path to escape?
18571,where,where was the escape path indeed?
18572,death,"my ‘death in life’, as i saw it, continued."
18573,exercise,"the kananook unit had a small backyard, so reza started doing his 15-minute exercise regime outside."
18574,exercise,he now added chin-ups to his arm-pumping exercise.
18575,inside,"one day he came inside, closed the screen door behind him that led straight into the kitchen, walked across the room and stopped in the doorway of the living room."
18576,sink,"‘well, i want you to apologise.’  i ignored him and turned back to the sink."
18577,power,"only i have the special power to resist these things.’  so his laziness was, in his eyes, one ‘special power’."
18578,inside,"he (and i) would then stay closed up inside for the rest of the day with all his ordering around, machismo, bad language and smoking."
18579,suspect,there was no job; i suspect he returned home not long after ali and i had left.
18580,abuse,"the rest of that year is a colourless blur of train travel and work, arguments and ongoing abuse."
18581,where,"if reza was not on the sofa he was on the toilet, where he spent more and more time as he struggled with haemorrhoids."
18582,taken,reza had taken a knife to the red-and-grey cushions of the metal-framed chairs i had bought on hire purchase at myer not one month previously.
18583,where,"where the idea came from i don’t know, though it could have been from the play dough ali had as a toy."
18584,exercise,"the uncharacteristic inspiration came to him as he sat in front of the television flexing his hands, and for him it was the perfect exercise: one that could be done while doing nothing else."
18585,taken,"money was initially taken from what little we had left over from my salary and, later, our unemployment benefit after i stopped working with my second child."
18586,sink,"over the next two years we would sink nearly $20,000 into this idea."
18587,power,"his exercise of power over me was made stronger by the fact that i was now at home again full time, having taken a year’s maternity leave from the wool corporation (from which i would not return as reza refused to do anything to care for either ali or shirin)."
18588,where,we lived in a prison-like atmosphere where everyone is permanently on edge.
18589,toilet,ali and shirin could not watch cartoons as reza chose the tv channel and no one was allowed to change it – even as he spent long periods sitting on the toilet.
18590,exercise,"he goes to the tab, he does exercise with his grip strengthener, and he sleeps."
18591,sink,i made his soup 10 minutes late and he upended the whole pot down the sink.
18592,situation,"the truth is my situation is getting worse, from every angle."
18593,death,"he grabbed me and threw me on the grass and started to ask me why i was so mad and i said, ‘death has more value than this life’."
18594,inside,"[while this went on,] ali and shirin were left inside the house, then ali came out after us while shirin hid under her bed crying."
18595,imprisoned,once again i saw myself living out my mother’s imprisoned life.
18596,where,"after we had finished i decided to take ali and shirin to the small park next to our block, where i enjoyed a break from reza and the children enjoyed the swings and seesaw."
18597,where,where have you been?’ said reza when we returned.
18598,where,she will teach you a lesson.’  then i went to my room where i cried for the rest of the afternoon.
18599,where,"they returned with them to his flat, where they would stay; i joined them with the children a little later."
18600,abuse,"in part i had not wanted to worry her but, just as she had always done herself, i had also accepted all the abuse and poverty as unchangeable aspects of my life."
18601,poverty,"and they had talked to my siblings who, while not knowing everything, were old enough now (in their mid-twenties) to be able to read between the bruises and the poverty and have some idea of what i was going through."
18602,state,i would learn later that a letter from mansoor saying they needed ‘to see the state of sohila’ had been the catalyst for my parents coming to australia in the first place.
18603,poverty,"perhaps he sensed my parents’ unease at the poverty of our unit because at one point he said, ‘things will get better ."
18604,situation,the discussion around the table turned to my situation.
18605,torture,you can’t continue this life of torture.’  tears ran down my cheeks but i didn’t – couldn’t – speak for some time.
18606,custody,‘my friend at the hospital had an abusive husband and the courts gave her custody of her children.
18607,wall,i saw the smallest crack in the dark wall of my life.
18608,custody,"in all this time i had never really considered that australian law would be very different to the laws of the islamic regime, and that in this country it was possible for a wife to win custody."
18609,question,"the next week i would go to the monash medical centre with my mother, father and mansoor but thank god the doctor would tell me that an abortion was out of the question – at almost five months, i was much too far along in the pregnancy."
18610,where,‘where have you been?’  ‘to mansoor’s house.
18611,wall,"‘what did your parents bring from iran?’  ‘they brought some wall hangings, some dresses for me, and a pearl necklace.’  ‘didn’t they bring any gold?’  ‘no.’  ‘you’re lying.’  he turned away without a word, picked up a packet of cigarettes from the kitchen counter and headed outside."
18612,where,the three of us headed down the street for the short walk to kananook station from where we could catch the train to frankston.
18613,where,where are you going?’  my shoulders slumped.
18614,where,"when reza caught up to us i told him, as calmly as i could, where i was planning to go."
18615,toilet,a couple of evenings later reza went to the toilet.
18616,toilet,"they were hidden among various books in the upper part of a cupboard, but the cupboard was in a narrow hallway – made narrower by my growing belly – and right opposite the toilet door."
18617,toilet,‘what are you doing?’ my husband asked through the door of the toilet.
18618,toilet,"i bundled everything up together and hid them in a storage unit in the carport outside, a few moments before reza came out of the toilet."
18619,where,‘where do you want to go?
18620,deprivation,"had my father forgotten the swearing that had polluted my childhood, the lack of even acknowledging me for days at a time, the deprivation he had imposed on his wife, mother and children?"
18621,taken,"was it any wonder i had taken the first man who had come along, without pausing to think about who he might really be?"
18622,where,"‘how did my fashionable tehran daughter, who everyone wanted to see where she would go and what she would achieve, end up with this fate worse than my own?’  i burst out, shaking and screaming."
18623,court,"it is the convention in iran that if a couple wish to separate, the parents will step in and discuss the situation before things go to court."
18624,where,‘where have you been?’ reza snapped when i stepped into the living room.
18625,where,‘i told you where i was going.
18626,where,i had lunch with my parents and brother and sister.’  ‘where is my passport?’  the blood drained from my face.
18627,where,"trying hard not to stammer, i told him it was in the cupboard where it was normally kept."
18628,inside,why did you take my passport?’  out of nowhere i felt a strength growing inside me that i had not had for many years.
18629,taken,i have taken your passport and mine and left them with my father.
18630,inside,"but you cannot have the children.’  i held his gaze, suppressing the storm inside me."
18631,situation,"‘they will come next week and we will discuss the situation.’  ‘no one is allowed to come here,’ he said."
18632,prisoner,"perhaps my feelings were something like those of a newly released prisoner: free, but having no idea what to do with that freedom."
18633,authorities,reporting issues like mine to the authorities was not something many people did in iran.
18634,police,"to go to the police was to be looked down upon, even if you were the victim."
18635,police,my parents prided themselves on never having set foot inside a police station for any reason.
18636,case,the story of my next two months taught me just how different things were in australia as i drew assistance from numerous agencies and was amazed at times at how effective they all were at liaising with each other about my case.
18637,situation,"the next day i contacted community services (sometimes called protective services), told them about my situation and shared the anxiety i had for my children."
18638,court,"i also went to the frankston magistrates’ court to ask about taking action against reza, but they redirected me to the local legal aid office."
18639,police,to my surprise they also told me that reza had been to the police himself and reported me missing on the evening of the day i left.
18640,custody,"after sharing my story with one of their advisors, gisela, i was reassured that i would more than likely be able to obtain custody of my children and that i also had the right to remove my personal belongings from the kananook unit."
18641,police,i could seek the assistance of the police in this if need be.
18642,abuse,she also suggested that i file a complaint with the courts about reza’s abuse of me and seek an intervention order against him.
18643,where,mansoor took me to the hospital where a check-up reassured me that the foetuses were fine.
18644,custody,i should discuss custody of the children with reza and collect some of my belongings.
18645,police,"if he would not let me in, i would also have the right to call on the police for assistance."
18646,court,"gisela also suggested that i contact the family court, which is a federal (as opposed to state) court, to start formal separation proceedings."
18647,custody,an initial counselling session was set for mid-february at which reza and i could discuss matters such as property distribution (not that we had much) and custody arrangements.
18648,authorities,"i was still deeply worried about ali and shirin, but at least i knew i had support in my plight from my family, the authorities and the law."
18649,where,"‘where were you?’  ‘you know where i was,’ i said."
18650,wall,i don’t give you permission.’  my dad placed his hand on a small framed picture on the wall.
18651,wall,"now you will let us take it, and her other belongings.’  as my father lifted the picture from the wall, reza put out his hand to stop him."
18652,situation,"we drove to the frankston police station and, after explaining the situation, we were asked to return to the unit."
18653,police,a police car would follow in a few minutes.
18654,police,"my father waved to him and yelled, ‘the police are coming.’ mansoor parked on the street and he and my mother waited in the car again while my father and i greeted the police officers and walked the 50 metres up the driveway with them."
18655,officers,the officers explained that they could not break in themselves but as this was my home there was no reason why i could not enter via the window myself.
18656,police,i went inside – the bedroom was still crowded with boxes of reza’s exerciser plasticine – then opened the front door and invited the police officers and my father inside.
18657,police,"standing in his usual macho pose, he glared at the officers and said, ‘who said you could come inside the house?’  he reached toward me and tried to pull a bag out of my hands, but one of the police stepped in and stopped him, pushing his chest to hold him back."
18658,where,you reported your wife missing to me when you knew exactly where she was.’  reza went pale.
18659,police,"‘now,’ the police officer said, ‘your wife can collect her personal belongings.’  i walked out of the house and handed the bags to mansoor to put in the car."
18660,police,"we thanked the police for their help while reza, who seemed smaller, stood in the doorway glowering."
18661,escaped,"laya had finally escaped the pain of this life in september 1987, just a short time before i escaped reza."
18662,guilt,"we played doctors and nurses too, and felt a bit of guilt about that, as i recall – not that anyone ever checked on two young girls playing in their room."
18663,inside,"there have been millions of women like this in iran – they are the backbone of iranian society, ‘burning’ inside yet successfully bringing up their children and keeping the family safe."
18664,law,"the mother, a dominating and unkind woman, didn’t like her new daughter- in-law and it wasn’t long into the marriage that she was accusing laya of theft."
18665,law,"laya denied the accusation, but her mother-in-law had decided that it must have been her."
18666,where,where have you come from?’ said mehdi.
18667,city council,in tehran hedayat soon found work watering trees and gardens for the city council on a minimal salary of seven toman per month.
18668,wall,"ghal-e was almost cartoon-like in its external structure: a large walled rectangle of four hectares with circular towers on each corner, about 30 centimetres higher than the wall, and two smaller towers in the middle of each long side."
18669,inside,"inside, ghal-e was a gated community – the two ancient gates to the fortress, four or five metres high, were closed at night."
18670,wall,"groups of seven or eight huts shared a common wall and gate, a yard and a single pit toilet."
18671,toilet,"in summer there would be hundreds of flies buzzing around the toilet, while in winter you would need to carry a lamp to use it."
18672,inside,"the winters were very cold, with snow piling up so that residents had to force their doors open from the inside; there was always a wooden shovel, a paroo, on hand to remove snow from the roof and courtyard."
18673,death,"azrael, the angel of death, was always present as the people were so poor they could afford little or no health care."
18674,where,"as children, my father sometimes took us to one of these gardens where mulberry trees grew in two rows alongside a narrow creek."
18675,inside,"others, like hedayat, worked for tehran council or in one of the various stores inside ghal-e."
18676,poverty,despite the poverty there was a strong sense of community within the walls of ghal-e.
18677,hole,the men would dig a large hole that they would fill with wood – this would become the cooking fire.
18678,building,"he promised that if they provided him with household belongings like plates, bowls, fabrics and foodstuffs, he would return in a month and every family would, from that point, have their own self-contained building."
18679,toilet,no longer would they need to share a courtyard and toilet.
18680,city council,"his boss, mansor ol-mamalek, the manager of the city council, happened to pass by after inspecting the gardens."
18681,death,"there was no autopsy or investigation, but with hindsight it seems likely that his liver or another vital organ was badly damaged, leading to his slow death."
18682,death,"with the death of her husband, and despite the young ages of her boys, laya needed to find some work."
18683,where,daily washing was done from a bucket in the small private courtyard outside the home; only occasionally would the family travel by foot or bus to the nearby suburb of hassan abad where there was a public bath.
18684,inside,laya would then invite him inside.
18685,authority,~  laya was known to have a cheeky sense of humour and a limited respect for authority.
18686,war,"ozra pointed this out, saying, ‘if general parsa sees this, he will be angry.’  general parsa was the manager of the hospital, a formidable man who had only one arm, presumably the other lost to a war wound."
18687,detention,"‘i will put you in detention,’ said the general."
18688,punishment,"to be fair, laya’s brutality was typical of the treatment of children in iran at this time, and of methods of punishment which had been passed down the generations."
18689,inside,"as there was no school in ghal-e, he spent his days with the other kids either inside the walls of ghal-e or in the large gardens in the valley below."
18690,where,"laya returned from work one day and told asghar that the next day she would take him to haj esmaeil, the owner of a metal-working shop, where he could work as an apprentice."
18691,police,"he walked to the tea house and told haj that if he treated the boy in this way again, he would go to the police."
18692,case,"and in any case the other employees, who were all older than asghar, would also beat him."
18693,police,‘why do you hit the child?’ she grabbed haj’s collar and told him asghar would not return to work for a few weeks and in the meantime she would tell the police (though she did not carry out this threat).
18694,abuse,"later, he started making metal objects at home – shoe horns, barbecues, buckets, toy aeroplanes and other small items – until eventually he was given some work by a roofing contractor, a much nicer man who paid asghar properly and did not abuse him."
18695,where,there was much chatter as people worried about where they would go and what would happen to the jobs that so many of them had at the hospital.
18696,guard,"when they arrived at the gates of the palace a guard asked them what they were doing; after telling him their story, he said that they had the courage of lionesses."
18697,inside,with a sigh the assistant returned inside.
18698,where,"alternatively, they could move to the new suburb of nazi abad where they would get a larger block of land for just one toman per metre – again a very low rate."
18699,nazi,most people chose to move to nazi abad to be closer to amenities; laya and my parents were among this group.
18700,war,"he had been shot in that leg during world war i in tabriz, azerbaijan."
18701,court,"the next day i filed a complaint of assault at the frankston magistrates’ court and a hearing was set down for the following wednesday, 27 january 1988 – a date i will never forget."
18702,court,reza arrived at the court that day wearing a grey suit but no tie and with a lawyer beside him.
18703,power,but these symbols of power could not hide the fact that he was pale and nervous.
18704,law,this man who loved to parade his strength in front of me had become a mouse when confronted by the law.
18705,police,"after a police officer read my complaint to the judge, reza’s defence was that in the last seven years i had never accused him of assault before."
18706,court,the court also heard from the police officer to whom reza had falsely reported me missing.
18707,assaulting,"he was restrained from ‘assaulting, harassing, molesting, threatening or directly contacting’ me for one year."
18708,court,"i had represented myself at the magistrates’ court, which was not unusual for an intervention request."
18709,lawyer,"however, now that i knew reza had a lawyer i asked if legal aid could find a lawyer to assist me with future hearings."
18710,lawyer,"originally it was my intention to go along, but having made an appointment with a lawyer for the middle of that week, i changed my mind."
18711,death,"i wanted this trip to finish quickly.’ (when i first read this, years later after my father’s death, i cried and cried."
18712,lawyer,i wanted to be able to give the lawyer a complete picture.
18713,lawyer,"i woke up on wednesday, 3 february, feeling as optimistic as i had for a while and looking forward to meeting my lawyer at two o’clock that afternoon."
18714,police,he had told police that i was having an incestuous relationship with my brother and that i had indecently touched my son.
18715,police,"on meeting my lawyer, michael, he explained that the police had spoken to him and, while they needed to follow procedure and also interview reza and ali, they did not believe there was any reason to be taking reza’s allegations seriously."
18716,court,"the next day, one of the workers from community services took me and the children to the children’s court in melbourne – the court responsible for children at risk."
18717,custody,"on the basis of reza’s recent behaviour, including the lies he had told police and the intervention order, i was granted interim custody of ali and shirin for three weeks, pending a formal hearing."
18718,court,"as it turned out, we did not need to return to the children’s court."
18719,court,"on the day before that hearing date, at the instigation of my lawyer, reza consented via his lawyer to my having interim sole custody of ali and shirin until we attended a compulsory family court counselling meeting on 2 march."
18720,court,"the family law court in dandenong is a very plain, two-storey concrete and glass government building on a nondescript street behind the main shopping precinct."
18721,building,but as i walked out of the building he started following me.
18722,court,"i turned to go back to the court for help, but as i tried to walk past reza he took hold of my arm."
18723,court,i clambered back to my feet and started moving towards the court again.
18724,court,"i have nothing else to say.’  reza followed me, in silence now, back inside the court building."
18725,police,there i found two police officers and asked if they could accompany me to the bus stop.
18726,court,"fourteen months after the scene at the family court, on 1 june, 1989, my divorce was finally granted."
18727,court,"and in any case, since the incident at the court and the support i had from the police, i no longer held any strong fears of reza."
18728,authorities,extending my mother’s visitor visa was a formality but my father’s departure turned out to be a bureaucratic nightmare typical of what we expected from the iranian authorities.
18729,guard,"caught off guard by the embassy official, i denied the letter to the newspaper and said that i planned to go back to iran later but could not do so now because of my pregnancy."
18730,authorities,"i meant none of this of course, but even after seven years found myself switching back to the sorts of lies iranians had to tell routinely in their dealings with the authorities."
18731,taken,"(later i would realise that it would have been difficult in practice for reza to steal the children as i still had his passport with me, taken on new year’s day along with my own."
18732,lawyer,"in late 1989 my lawyer, michael, received a request from reza’s lawyer for the passport to be returned."
18733,industrial,"then, after everything he had been through, the flight was cancelled due to industrial action and he had to wait another week."
18734,abuse,my path away from constant fear and reza’s mental and physical abuse was not a road free of anxiety and wretchedness.
18735,taken,"i had very few belongings: from our unit i had taken only my clothes, my books and a few items that had been gifts."
18736,taken,she also worried about whether she would be able to leave australia with just a copy of the passport my father had taken with him.
18737,situation,i don’t think he could comprehend the situation and it became more and more uncomfortable for me.
18738,where,we made our way to the front door where i pushed the buzzer.
18739,abuse,"in fact, every time the five of us headed out to the shops or to visit property managing agents i had to steel myself for the likelihood of some form of abuse."
18740,police,out of fear and anger i finally moved away and went to the nearest police station where i burst into tears trying to explain what had happened.
18741,police,"the female police officer was very cool, showing no emotion, and looked down on me as if i was dirt."
18742,abuse,"a group of teenagers, boys and girls probably about 15 years old, started yelling racist abuse at us from the road at one end of the ground."
18743,where,"they pushed ali, just eight years old, to the ground a number of times, taunting him with comments about where he ‘came from’ and saying that he wouldn’t be able to keep up at school."
18744,where,"ali ran home and came in the door shouting, ‘mummy, mummy.’ we went out and found the trio not far from where they had assaulted him, but on seeing us they ran away before we reached them."
18745,possession,when the staff investigated they discovered the knife in the girl’s possession.
18746,abuse,"it was just as i had often allowed reza’s verbal abuse to go unanswered, and as my mother had often failed to respond to the cursing of my father when i was young."
18747,guilty,"i was allowing myself to feel embarrassed and guilty for no reason, in fact taking on the guilt that others should rightfully be feeling."
18748,court,"of course my college course only added to the load at home and the first few months of 1989 were a blur of more sickness in the twins, court dates, house hunting and assignments."
18749,freedom,it was more than a year since i had left reza and i was not going to give up the freedom i had gained by succumbing to domestic pressures.
18750,court,"the whole process took a little longer than six months, but in november 1989 we moved out of joy street and into a three-bedroom grey brick av jennings home in hartwell court in frankston."
18751,gate,"(the next year, when my parents visited again, my father made a gate in the fence, giving the kids direct access to the school grounds, and from that time on they were nearly always late!)"
18752,where,"this was one of about 30 houses owned by the co-op, and the main condition of occupying a house was that i had to attend two cooperative meetings each month where we would discuss maintenance needed in any of the houses, vacancies, budgets and so on."
18753,court,~  the move to hartwell court marked the beginning of one of the happiest periods of my life as my family and i settled into life there over the coming years.
18754,where,"both were motivated by what they now knew australia had to offer compared with iran, where life was becoming steadily more difficult."
18755,court,over time we came to know all the people in hartwell court.
18756,court,"there were many times, especially when they were younger, that the 15 children who lived in hartwell court all played a game together."
18757,court,"it was a very sad day when we moved away from hartwell court, with many tears shed."
18758,freedom,"oh, what freedom this gave me!"
18759,custody,"thinking for so long that, as my husband, he would have automatic custody of my children – as was the case in iran – was the main reason it had never crossed my mind to leave him."
18760,law,"perhaps, if i studied law, i would be able to help others in my position."
18761,lawyer,i was going to become a lawyer.
18762,law,my decision to study law was made at the end of 1990.
18763,law,it did not take long to establish that i could not simply walk up to the monash university school of law and expect to be admitted.
18764,state,"in fact, i found that without having completed the vce – the state’s high school certificate – i would not be able to get into any university course at all."
18765,law,"if my marks in that course were good enough, i would be able to get into law where, after four years of full time study, including taking the summer programs, i could get my degree."
18766,where,the tafe had a child care centre where i was able to leave the twins.
18767,law,now i was ready to finally go through those doors at the school of law.
18768,law,when i explained she told me not to worry – arts was as good as law.
18769,law,i must do law.
18770,law,she asked me why i wanted to study law.
18771,law,"i also told her that i was determined to get into law, and that if it wasn’t this year then it would be next."
18772,law,as i left the school of law that day i felt like i was on the set of a movie.
18773,court,"i screamed with joy when i got back to hartwell court, dancing on the table to a michael jackson song."
18774,slavery,"~  if my previous studies had been hard work, law was slavery."
18775,guilty,"even the most basic concepts were foreign to me: where australia operates an adversarial legal system (essentially ‘innocent until proven guilty’), iran operates an inquisitorial system (roughly the opposite)."
18776,law,the only exercise i could get was walking rapidly from the university car park to the law school.
18777,law,"in the second semester of 1995, my third year, i failed both constitutional law and equity and trust."
18778,where,"our christmas dinner that year would be mcdonald’s – or at least it was going to be until my next door neighbour silvana noticed and asked us to join her family, where we had a lovely time."
18779,court,"the final subject of my degree, held the following summer, was a ‘moot court’ exercise – a pretend court."
18780,case,it was the case of a boy who had jumped over a fence to retrieve a ball and been bitten by a dog.
18781,court,it took some minutes for the ‘judge’ to regain control of his court as it descended into laughter while i stood blushing and waiting for quiet.
18782,where,"on my graduation day in 1997, all my children came with me (where mostly it was parents attending the graduation of one of their children)."
18783,law,"~  as any lawyer knows, practising law isn’t as simple (or incredibly difficult) as gaining a university qualification."
18784,inside,"after your degree, you need to do ‘articles’ – essentially an on-the-job apprenticeship inside a legal firm."
18785,law,"for me, this proved even more difficult than getting into the monash law school."
18786,law,"over my last year at university i submitted 52 applications to law firms, large and small, inside and outside melbourne."
18787,court,"at one point i became so frustrated that i wrote a letter to michael kirby, then a justice of the high court of australia."
18788,law,all through that final year i would check the noticeboards in the law school.
18789,law,in november i noticed an advertisement on the board from someone looking for the assistance of a law graduate.
18790,where,"the address was an apartment in south yarra, not far from where i had first lived with reza over 15 years earlier."
18791,lawyer,"yuri asked me about myself and then explained his business idea, which was to offer companies a service whereby we would refer them to the appropriate lawyer to meet any specific need they had."
18792,charge,there would be no cost to the company; prime law brokers (the name of his business) would charge a marketing fee to the lawyer for our service.
18793,law,i told yuri that if he took me on i would do whatever was needed to make prime law brokers a success.
18794,sentences,"on top of those problems, i had a habit of leaving sentences incomplete which, again, was unprofessional."
18795,law,"during my law course i had spent time in community legal centres as a volunteer, but even then i never spoke to clients."
18796,law,yuri’s new idea was that we would offer law broking to the general public.
18797,criminal,"when the next issue of the phone book was published in a few months’ time, people would be able to call in, explain the situation that caused them to need a lawyer and then we would refer them, at no cost, to someone with the right speciality – family law, criminal law and so on."
18798,law,it was prime law brokers for the masses.
18799,where,"most of the work would happen at yuri’s apartment, where i would work alongside tamara, answering the phone, recording client details and entering them into a computer."
18800,question,"when i did get the greeting right – ‘prime law brokers, how may i help you?’ – i was concentrating so hard that i would forget to ask an important question, such as whether the caller would be able to afford legal assistance."
18801,question,"he hammered me about the way i answered the phone, or the way i spoke to clients, or a question i forgot to ask."
18802,law,eventually i suggested to yuri that frooshad come and join us; by now she was studying law herself but was keen to earn some money working part time.
18803,inside,"i was a great admirer of yuri’s entrepreneurial spirit but now, left to my own devices, i discovered that somewhere inside me was some of the same flair."
18804,law,the law institute of victoria became involved and started to pressure the yellow pages not to accept our advertising – something that could have closed us down almost instantly.
18805,law,"this was despite the fact that our service cost nothing for the client and actually fed work to lawyers and legal firms, and sometimes we even referred potential clients to the law institute (among other government or community organisations) if we were unable to help them or if they couldn’t afford to pay a lawyer."
18806,law,"even so, i still feel that we were poorly treated by the law institute."
18807,law,"~  as our interstate advertising had started to attract increasingly more calls, by 2000 it became necessary for me to travel to the capital cities in various states to meet with law firms."
18808,law,prime law brokers was at its peak at this time so i could afford to stay in nice hotels and eat in good restaurants.
18809,ordered,"when i ordered the bouillabaisse, he personally helped me put a bib on so that i wouldn’t splash my clothes."
18810,racism,"it seemed that when i dressed smartly, racism and prejudice melted away."
18811,where,"i had dined at a restaurant overlooking the harbour with its iconic bridge and the opera house, then gone to the foyer of the sheraton hotel where i knew there was a piano bar."
18812,situation,"a diary entry from this time, written on the train on the way into melbourne, summarises my situation."
18813,law,prime law brokers.
18814,law,prime law brokers.
18815,law,prime law brokers.
18816,law,prime law brokers.
18817,law,prime law brokers.
18818,where,i realise that i have done this so often that now i know where people are calling from even before they tell me!
18819,taken,"i won’t.’  as a break during one of my business trips i had taken a bus trip to hahndorf, a popular tourist destination outside adelaide."
18820,where,"i won’t.’  i passed a restaurant a little further along, where three men were sitting at a table on the footpath."
18821,where,"‘it said “no”.’  another of the men asked me where i was from and when i told him he said, ‘are all iranian women so beautiful?’  ‘a thousand times more,’ i said."
18822,where,he walked me back to the hotel where i was staying and respectfully said good night.
18823,exercise,"as i was no longer travelling into a city office each day, i now had some time to do some exercise in the mornings."
18824,case,"as had always been the case, there was not much conversation between them."
18825,where,"you.’ i calculated that he must have been doing as she said and absentmindedly put the wad of notes on the bench beside him, from where the lady had picked it and tried to return it."
18826,taken,i had taken mum and dad to see him many times over the years.
18827,guilty,"i don’t think i yet understood the gravity of the situation, but i did feel guilty about hitting my father with the back-scratcher now that i knew there was actually something wrong with him."
18828,police,"a police officer found him, discovered the business card i had left with him and called me from the station."
18829,police,"this happened a number of times and the police became impatient, especially if i was delayed in retrieving asghar because of my work."
18830,where,he could go to the same home where fariba was the manager.
18831,where,i drove him there and we sat in the lounge where there was a woman providing some entertainment.
18832,where,his mind seemed sharp again as he clearly knew where he was and that he didn’t want to be there.
18833,where,where is the house with the stairs and the flowers and the trees?’  we started to think that we had made a bad mistake – that perhaps we had put him into this home too early.
18834,facility,finally the management of the home told me that they could not look after my father any more – they suggested a high-care facility in nearby mornington.
18835,where,"during this period, he managed one morning to take his suitcase to a bus stop on the main road, from where a lady gave him a lift to the bus stop for the airport shuttle from frankston."
18836,facility,"he just followed me wherever i went, including to this next facility."
18837,where,"i sobbed all the way home, where mum comforted me, saying, ‘you cannot look after him any more.’  in this place my father went downhill very quickly."
18838,locked,"they used a lot of medication to keep patients sedated, and the locked doors prevented him from moving around very much."
18839,toilet,"i wrote a long list of helpful words – water, toilet, food and so on – in both persian and english to help the nurses understand what dad was saying."
18840,where,my heart was in pain all the time as i thought about my father realising none of his family were around him and not being able to ask where we were because of his limited english.
18841,guilt,today i still feel guilt every time i think of how lonely he must have felt.
18842,death,he was like a sick little baby lying in bed waiting for death to arrive.
18843,guilt,‘your father has passed away peacefully.’  ~  my father’s death left me with a deep sense of guilt.
18844,guilt,"i felt guilt about the powerlessness of his situation, this strong man reduced to a mere shell."
18845,guilt,"most of all i felt guilt about not realising, until so late in his life, that underneath the foul mouth and distance of the father of my youth was a genuine human being."
18846,death,"16      love and loss, part two   my father’s death caused my mother to become deeply sad and dreadfully homesick for iran."
18847,police,"once we arrived in tehran the immigration officials and security police felt colder, more regimented."
18848,freedom,the lack of freedom or rights was obvious.
18849,building,like the manb-e abb house it had been replaced by a larger building.
18850,case,in any case the opinions of the masses would have had little influence on this regime.)
18851,where,"perhaps the only time i lost my smile was when i walked around the reservoir, past the place where i had first met reza."
18852,law,thanks to the success of prime law brokers i had earned enough over the previous decade to help all of my children into their own properties.
18853,law,"‘there is only one james and that is my son-in-law,’ she would say."
18854,law,"‘james is the best son-in-law in the world.’  on friday nights the three of us would buy fish and chips and coca-cola and sit at the top of olivers hill enjoying the view of frankston beach, port phillip bay and the melbourne central business district in the far distance."
18855,rehabilitation,"the long process of rehabilitation was made more difficult by her limited english, the foreign environment of the clinic and her age."
18856,where,"as dad had done, she started saying she wanted to go back to iran, and when i asked her who would look after her she said that there were seven neighbours – she was imagining going back to her childhood in ghal-e where they shared a yard with the occupants of seven other houses."
18857,inside,"she always felt better after these prayers, but the angst inside me continued to build."
18858,guilty,"at other times i worried that she might live on with ‘d’ for another twenty years, then felt guilty for having such a thought."
18859,police,the frankston police found her once; when i went to pick her up that time i found her sitting proudly in the back of a police car with two police officers in the front.
18860,inside,"at the same time, deep inside i was in conflict with myself, often wondering ‘what if ."
18861,where,"i would then leave a note for mum explaining that i had gone out to a meeting and that james had gone to bed with a headache, placing the note where she couldn’t miss it."
18862,sentences,every morning i would greet her with a series of affirming sentences.
18863,sentences,these words and sentences filled her soul with pride and happiness and i honestly believe had a positive effect on her dementia.
18864,deprivation,"it was almost impossible to comprehend how much she had experienced in her 82 years: the opulence of eisa khan and the poverty of ghal-e; 14 pregnancies and the loss of nine children; deprivation at the hands of an uncaring husband; the ceaseless labour needed just to keep her family happy and alive; the pain of discovering that i, too, had been in an abusive and demeaning marriage."
18865,death,shahin’s death quickly became a community celebration of her life.
18866,death,mum’s death lifted an enormous weight from my shoulders after over a decade of caring for both her and my father.
18867,guilt,"while i was deeply, deeply saddened by my mother’s death, there was none of the guilt i felt after my father’s."
18868,sink,"~  rubber gloves, a sink full of suds, a pile of dirty dishes."
18869,law,"for this i have to thank ostad bahram moshiri, for showing us the path to freedom and democracy and, more importantly, how to safeguard them via the due process of law."
18870,case,"if that involvement has diminished over time, when and why was that the case?"
18871,wall,do you think she should have seen the writing on the wall and avoided marrying reza (even if that meant she would not be able to emigrate)?
18872,situation,"if you met someone in sohila’s situation, do you think you would pick up the signs?"
18873,where,where would you send her for help?
18874,fugitive,"—james russell lowell, “on the capture of certain fugitive slaves near washington”  1 the blindfold is firmly tied."
18875,power,"he draws himself up even more fully erect and stares down at me, as if to reinforce the dominance not only of his stature but of the power he has over my life."
18876,evin,"i know where i am, or at least i can guess: this is evin prison, in northern tehran, some miles from my home in the inner suburbs."
18877,situation,"this is the horrifying contradiction of my situation: i want it to be known that i am someone who loves peace and books and conversations with my friends, but these things are irrelevant to this man who stands before me."
18878,situation,the interrogator lets the reality of my situation sink in.
18879,where,"“when i ask you something, answer me, do you understand?” “yes,” i reply, my voice seeming to come from somewhere far away from where i sit."
18880,pen,his plump hands are toying with a pen on the desk before him.
18881,power,"my gaze becomes transfixed by the fidgeting motion of his hands, as if the power he has over me is concentrated in them."
18882,situation,"i am going to speak to him as if he cares about my situation, even though he doesn’t."
18883,question,"“no,” he replies, answering his own question, “you don’t know, do you?"
18884,interrogation,"this vile man with his techniques of interrogation learned from bad movies is aiming his blow, taking his time."
18885,state,savak had been the state security arm of the pahlavi regime—the regime that ruled my country until two years before my birth in 1981.
18886,power,"the shah of iran, mohammad reza pahlavi, had been swept from power by one of the defining events of the twentieth century, the islamic revolution of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini."
18887,torture,"savak had been the most detested institution of the shah, a secret police force licensed to torture, murder, and imprison at will."
18888,thug,"he had been a high-ranking officer in the shah’s army, loyal to pahlavi, yes, but not a zealot, not a thug, not a killer."
18889,power,"nobody will sympathize with you.” although i was born after khomeini’s triumphant return to iran and grew up under the regime he created, i was raised as if pahlavi were still in power, or at least as if he might soon return to power."
18890,state,"but by 1986, when i turned five, it must have become apparent to my father and mother that the zealots who ruled iran were there for keeps, and so i was required to adopt a second set of rules and restrictions, an outdoor set imposed by the state."
18891,term,i became familiar with the protocols of the “primitives” (a term my father applied to the regime and its supporters) little by little.
18892,state,"the state expected that i would understand things in the way it prescribed, while my family, especially my father, urged on me an alternative way of seeing the world."
18893,state,"and on top of this dual understanding, i was expected to keep one way of seeing the world private, spoken of only within the family home, while the second understanding was to be public, a way of advertising my loyalty to the state."
18894,freedom,freedom and tolerance were valued.
18895,captive,"and iran, my country, was the captive of sinister, inflexible people who saw the world in black and white, no color permitted, no shading, no nuances, no tolerance of beauty outside of islamic spirituality."
18896,war,"but there was more to learn, for iran was at war with saddam hussein’s iraq, and had been for the whole of my life."
18897,war,there could be no two ways of thinking about young iranian men killed in this war; there was nothing ambiguous about death on the battlefield.
18898,war,"a cousin of my mother, a boy of nineteen, had been killed in the war, and we were in mourning."
18899,war,"such traditions are common all over the world, regardless of religion or culture, but in the iran of the mullahs, particularly during the war with iraq, this custom of mourning grew and grew to the point where it had ceased to serve a genuine human need and became instead something monstrously neurotic."
18900,war,"for example, the husband of a young woman living next door to us was killed on the battlefield, and this poor woman was expected to forsake smiling at anything from the moment the news reached her until years in the future, the actual number of years contingent on how long the war lasted."
18901,death,"naturally, she had nothing to smile about when she heard of her husband’s death, but the proscription on smiling meant that she could not behave in any natural, human way for years to come—she could not even smile for her children."
18902,state,"nor could she begin to think of courtship until she had served what her family and the state judged to be an acceptable widowhood, not that the courtship would have amounted to anything more than an agreement to marry a certain man chosen for her."
18903,war,"and it was the war, of course,  that heightened this madness; it was the war that made “martyrdom” into a national fetish."
18904,war,"within my own family, the war was spoken of as a disaster, pure and simple."
18905,war,"in the streets, in school, in any public place, the war with iraq was represented with brazen symbols (a salivating saddam with the horns of a demon) or with words that had the same function as brazen symbols: evil, martyrdom, sacrifice."
18906,war,"so the war introduced a further difficulty for me, another psychological impediment to behaving in a natural and spontaneous way in public, because i wasn’t free to think of it as purely and simply a clash between good and evil: the rulers of iran were in the right in fighting saddam, but they were not above criticism themselves."
18907,freedom,you want the freedom to think for yourself.
18908,cell,"in a strange way, those pink shoes and my appetite for the places i might go in them led me, after many twists and turns, to a cell in evin prison."
18909,torture,"the opportunity to gloat, menace, torture."
18910,pleading,"and what a rewarding subject of sadism i am: terrified out of my mind, staring at him with eyes filled with pleading."
18911,inside,"but oddly enough, i find myself laughing on the inside, as if my sense of humor demands some expression."
18912,insane,that would be insane.
18913,punishment,"that would end in punishment, or worse."
18914,question,"is that what you expect me to believe?” “yes.” he shakes his head in contempt, then repeats his question, and repeats it again, betraying his impatience with gestures and expressions of disdain."
18915,interrogation,is it my father who is the real subject of the interrogation?
18916,police,"and inside my head, a pleading voice is whispering, please let me go, please let me go … when my friends and i heard of fellow students being picked up by the police and questioned in a room like this one i sit in now, how bravely we spoke about the way we would behave!"
18917,where,where is your pride now?
18918,thug,"maybe the shah’s regime was as vile and corrupt and cruel as you say, but not everyone who served the shah was a thug."
18919,interrogation,my first interrogation ends with these wearying questions about my father.
18920,guard,the interrogator gestures to a guard.
18921,guard,the guard nudges me to make me walk.
18922,cell,i follow a long route back to my cell.
18923,cell,"dear god, how i love this cell!"
18924,where,this predilection was bound to make trouble for me in a country where a very stern version of islam had been imposed.
18925,state,"if i had grown up in a calvinist state, in an orthodox jewish state, in a fundamentalist protestant state, in any state that insisted on a severe expression of belief, i would have faced the same problems."
18926,police,"with the home life i enjoyed, no wonder the life in the streets—at least that part of it under scrutiny by the mullahs, the police, and the basiji (the regime’s youth militia)—puzzled and perplexed me, even while i made sure that i was not violating any public rules of dress and conduct."
18927,state,"girls below the age of eight were allowed more latitude, but after a girl’s eighth birthday, it was as if a state-appointed sentry had taken up a position outside her front door, ready to cast his gaze over the attire she set forth in each day, attire she discarded with relief when she returned home."
18928,where,"when i was still very young, no more than five years old, my mother took me to zoroastrian ceremonies of dedication and worship, where a flame burned as the symbol of the radiant light that is at the heart of all life in our world and beyond."
18929,state,"my brothers and sisters and i considered it quite normal to live in a household where both allah and zoroaster were worshipped, not all that uncommon a state of affairs in iran, where many muslims (although not the fundamentalists) harbor a fugitive respect for the more ancient religion."
18930,question,"both zoroastrianism and islam were conscientiously explained to me, and after that, the question was simply, what do you think, zarah?"
18931,conviction,"the emphasis was placed on what actually is a profound conviction of the religion, even though it sounds sugary: niceness or, more specifically, nice talking, nice behavior, nice thinking."
18932,death,zoroastrianism is not a proselytizing religion (and that’s just as well; looking for converts to a religion other than islam is punishable by death in iran); its message of reverence for life is not so much broadcasted as demonstrated.
18933,injustice,my mother’s priority was to save her children from harm; my father’s priority was to highlight injustice.
18934,cell,"5 i am sitting in my cell, petrified by fear."
18935,cell,"i sit and stare at the door of the cell, at the slot through which the guard drops my blindfold when it is time for me to be escorted back to the interrogator."
18936,state,"even in this pathetic state, my mind is attempting to make sense of my situation, searching for comparisons."
18937,war,"the war is raging in iranian cities, particularly in tehran; it is the mid-eighties."
18938,camp,"some camp outside stores overnight, with pillows and blankets and hampers of food."
18939,cell,"in my cell, i cover my face with my hands."
18940,war,6 my mother’s cousin was killed in the war against iraq when he was not much older than a boy.
18941,death,the death grieved my mother terribly.
18942,war,"it’s nothing.” mom had a brother fighting in the war, and i felt sure that she was thinking both of him and of her cousin when tears ran down her cheeks."
18943,war,the war was everywhere.
18944,taken,these pictures would have been taken when the young men first joined the army.
18945,death,and a death in the family was a catastrophe.
18946,war,"the war was all around us, too, when we visited my mother’s family in kermanshah, and my father’s family; both of my parents were kermanshahis."
18947,where,"this is the region of iran where the majority of iranian kurds live, and also the region where zoroastrianism has its most committed adherents."
18948,war,"during the war, it was hellish."
18949,war,"when we visited one summer during the middle years of the war, the iraqis bombed the refineries."
18950,war,"in the streets of kermanshah and tehran (and this would surely have been true for every other iranian city, every iranian town), i saw war widows scrounging for food for their children, desperate to keep their kids alive."
18951,war,"in spite of the government’s incessant lauding of the “heroes” of the war, the widows of those martyrs usually struggled for life with the breadwinner gone."
18952,poverty,"iranian families are close-knit and supportive, but the help many families could offer was limited by poverty."
18953,war,i saw fathers who came back from war to find nothing.
18954,war,prisoners of war sometimes found no trace of the life they had lived years before.
18955,captivity,in some ways even more heartbreaking was the experience of pows who returned after years of captivity only to discover that they had been listed not as pows but as having been killed.
18956,war,"i knew of such men who had been carried off to war on a wave of patriotism, praised for their dedication to the nation and to the ideals of the revolution."
18957,war,"everyone in iran, my family included, became bleakly familiar with returnees from the war whose minds were so wrenched by their experiences  that they could never regain their sense of belonging to anyone or anything."
18958,war,"one of my older relatives fought for the entire nine years of the war and, over that period, became a complete stranger to the rest of us in his family."
18959,war,"only injury or the insistence of senior officers (and he was quite senior himself, and highly decorated) would force him to leave the front; fighting the war meant more to him than anything else."
18960,war,"when the war ended, he could no longer avoid facing the other part of his life: the domestic part, the part that he was unable to commit himself to, being a warrior."
18961,state,"he returned to find his eldest son in an appalling state: addicted to heroin, half crazed, ill, his face haggard and his expression haunted."
18962,war,"he said to the father, the war hero, “is this the son that you have raised?"
18963,war,"he does not come to visit us, and he is always spending time with his friends and having fun.” the father responded with a bitter smile: “when we were at war defending you and your dignity, we expected that all of you back here would look after the well-being of our families."
18964,war,"but what of our trust in you?” will i sound precocious if i say that the war wearied me, left me exhausted?"
18965,war,"will it sound egocentric to the reader if i say that the war blighted my childhood, forced me to mature too quickly?"
18966,state,"after all, the young men at the front who were compelled to clear minefields by marching over them, who experienced the horror of gas attacks, of bombardments that went on for days at a time, who fought in a half-starved state, who were sacrificed in suicidal attacks over open ground—these iranians and their families surely have the most to complain about."
18967,war,but war creates casualties both on and off the battlefield.
18968,war,iranian children of my generation became secondary victims of war.
18969,guilty,our smiles were guilty smiles.
18970,war,the unyielding severity of the regime’s dogma was further intensified by war propaganda.
18971,war,"what the regime’s brand of piety did not destroy, the misery of war suffocated."
18972,fugitive,"that period of my life—my fugitive childhood—left me with a longing to create a proper childhood for my own children, when those children come along, as i hope with all my heart they will."
18973,guard,i’m being prodded and pushed down the corridor by the guard.
18974,evin,interrogations go on around the clock in evin.
18975,taken,the guard forces me down onto a chair in what i think is the same room i’ve been taken to before.
18976,interrogation,"i expect the blindfold to be removed, as it has been at each interrogation up until now."
18977,wall,"high on the wall above the desk is a long, horizontal window, blacked out with paint and tape."
18978,freedom,"the door to the right is a heavy thing, made of metal, meant to deter any idea of a sudden rush for freedom."
18979,power,"as adults, they retain all the worst features of repellent little boys, exercising power over the powerless."
18980,question,"he’s waiting for my answer, as i was waiting for this question."
18981,arrested,"he’s been arrested a number of times, brought here to evin and kept for months at a time."
18982,evin,"sometimes when i meet him and ask how he is, he grins and says, “missing evin.” he never spoke in detail about what he’d endured, so it is only now that i understand how brave he was to be able to make such a joke."
18983,law,"he was studying law last year, but they wouldn’t let him finish his degree."
18984,question,"instead of answering his question, i ask if i can remove my blindfold."
18985,taken,"there are close-ups, full-length shots, and shots obviously taken from a distance with a telephoto lens."
18986,inside,"i can’t seem to make it stick inside my head that they are not the same, they are above all laws, they are not required to account for things such as spying, eavesdropping, taking unauthorized pictures, blindfolding people, beating them, humiliating them."
18987,locked,"that no citizen can be snatched from the street, locked up, denied legal representation, compelled to make confessions?"
18988,arrest,because that is exactly what my country’s constitution guarantees—freedom from arbitrary  arrest and coercion.
18989,locked,"even though i’ve been told of countless cases of people who oppose the government being locked up and abused, i haven’t been able to make myself accept that these people who serve the government of my country will do me whatever harm they wish."
18990,pen,"i struggle to make the pen work, struggle to write."
18991,cell,i hear a knock on the door of the cell.
18992,pen,i place the pen on the desk next to the pictures and the sheet of paper on which i’ve written.
18993,where,"if it’s not, if you still can’t remember, you know exactly what will happen.”  he slaps me on the shoulder where the belt has ripped my skin, then leaves the room."
18994,pen,i take up the ballpoint pen in my right hand.
18995,pen,"i sit squeezing the pen, struggling to find a solution to the dilemma."
18996,punishment,each second of delay in writing something down carries me closer to punishment.
18997,where,i touch my shoulder where the belt struck me and flinch.
18998,guilt,"the guilt makes me wretched, but my moral misery is immediately attacked by self-serving rationalizations: my friends would do the same if they were sitting here."
18999,death,"dear god, i’d always believed that i’d be so much stronger, that i’d resist and resist until death if need be."
19000,sentence,"an answer of yes to this question, as i fully understood when i refused to give any details of my visit to arash’s house, would likely be followed by a death sentence, and not just my death sentence."
19001,crime,i’ve implicated arash in the crime of possessing illegal books.
19002,illegal,"very good books that are illegal, yes?"
19003,illegal,"“that would be very, very serious.” what i want to say is that it is also illegal for him to touch me."
19004,cell,"but immediately i begin to fear that he will wish to make a point, wish to demonstrate his complete power over me, over everyone who is dragged into this cell."
19005,insane,"it’s inconceivable, but i truly believe that, for him, this is some insane form of violent courtship."
19006,cell,i’m shoved into my cell.
19007,liberty,"the liberty to explore a dozen relationships before making a commitment to one man, to one woman, is not available to most iranians, but this particular liberty, unlike certain others, is perhaps no great loss."
19008,inside,"after that, or so i imagine, it is all a matter of what one has inside: a capacity for loyalty, a desire for affection, spiritual ambition."
19009,term,the way we talked about boys and sex and good looks and male charisma and desire and longing can be summed up in the farsi term maskhare bazi.
19010,term,"a rough equivalent in english would be “teasing,” but the term suggests something more specific; “teasing about something that at another time would be taken seriously” perhaps conveys the fuller meaning of maskhare bazi."
19011,possession,"the man i had noticed was, as the cliché goes, tall, dark, and handsome, but more important, he had an air of quiet self-possession and he projected a maturity beyond his years."
19012,power,"hypocrisy became a special hatred of ours—the hypocrisy of a government that awarded all sorts of treats to the people who endorsed its ideology, whether or not the endorsement was sincere, and withheld favors from those who voiced even the mildest criticism of those in power."
19013,insane,"in short, they had told me that i was insane."
19014,cell,"it was rare for me to see him without a cell phone at his ear, so my opportunities for letting him know of my existence were extremely limited."
19015,state,behnam responded to the introduction as if he were a diplomat of illustrious standing greeting a minor official from some unimportant foreign state.
19016,sentence,"such a question is loaded with a disguised intimacy and way outside the rules of the wooing ritual, which do not endorse any question whose answer would require the employment of a compound sentence."
19017,wall,"i worship the ground you walk on.” instead of that, i constructed a wall of ice between us."
19018,question,"the next time he asked me that question, i said, “sure, if it’s not out of your way.” the evening unfolded in the manner of a scene in a paperback romance, i am happy to report; i would have no complaints if the whole of life, for everyone, imitated a paperback romance."
19019,power,"i was perfectly well aware that behnam wanted to kiss me, and i’m ashamed to say that i was not above engaging in that girlie, teasing thing of making the man wait a little longer, enjoying the power of it, knowing with certainty that i could ask him to run barefoot around the block if i wanted to, and that he would sigh and complain but obey."
19020,justice,"but businessmen may also be sympathetic to the things that poets and visionaries clamor for, such as liberty and justice."
19021,probation,those in the community are on permanent probation.
19022,cell,"after all, behnam barely had time for politics; he was so busy making deals and troubleshooting on his cell phone that it was a wonder he could find time even to notice what was going on in the wider world."
19023,insane,are you insane?
19024,evin,"do you hear what i’m saying, zarah?” i wasn’t to know it at the time, but the next time someone shouted at me in this way would be in evin prison."
19025,question,"there was no question that i loved behnam, but his outburst had confused me."
19026,conviction,"love is deep, certainly, but so is conviction, including political conviction."
19027,war,"i was sick at heart, because the things that had the deepest hold on me were at war with my affections."
19028,liberty,"surely love is about the liberty of the soul, and my politics were also about the liberty of the soul."
19029,cell,it would be true to say that i had no real expectation of being kidnapped in the heart of tehran and hustled off to an interrogation cell.
19030,question,"for me, that was out of the  question."
19031,wall,i imagined a solid wall of books before i imagined a nursery.
19032,cell,our bickering was only ever suspended when behnam answered his cell phone.
19033,police,"he would also concede that the regime was content to subvert the constitution in any way it liked, that it maintained a secret police force as disgraceful as savak, that corruption within the higher echelons of the regime ran rampant, that women had less legislated freedom than slaves."
19034,conviction,"it is almost an occupational hazard of being female, this profound conviction that love will bring about desired change."
19035,conviction,"there is certainly no evidence to support this conviction, not anywhere in the world that exists here and now or in history."
19036,law,"my mother saw in him a protector for me, and when all is said and done, mothers everywhere are inclined to opt for sons-in-law who will provide for their daughters and keep them out of harm’s way."
19037,establishment,"the thing was, my mother was happy to see me marry into the establishment."
19038,liberty,"and i was my father’s daughter when it  came to politics, although i placed the emphasis on personal liberty more pointedly than he did."
19039,state,"in this desperately conflicted state, i agreed one day to accompany behnam to a wedding party."
19040,state,"one could dress to demonstrate the undiluted fundamentalism of one’s husband, leaving barely a square inch of skin exposed, and one could dress to show proper respect for the statutes of the state without going overboard: a vestment worn to cover one’s form from shoulders to lower calf in any of a half dozen fairly subdued colors; a scarf to cover the hair; a little lipstick, some eyeliner, some blush."
19041,conviction,"do you know what reputation means?” behnam spoke in that tone of outraged conviction, so false, that i had learned to detest."
19042,cell,"9 in the cell above me, i have found a friend."
19043,situation,"it’s good to have someone i know nearby, but this consolation has its limitations; two powerless people can do little more than sympathize with each other, and of all forms of relief a person might crave in my situation, sympathy is the least availing."
19044,cell,"it is the practical that i find myself dwelling on in this cell: the need to get a message out is only the foremost longing; after that, things such as hygiene occupy my thoughts, the yearning to be clean."
19045,pen,pen and paper.
19046,cell,"stretched out on the floor of my cell, i listen to ali reza’s voice recalling the details of my party, filling my head with memories of dancing and laughter, music, wonderful food like masst-o-khiar, minza ghasomi, khaviar, kabab koobideh."
19047,wall,"if i were walking to a wall where a firing squad awaited me, then maybe i would be content to acknowledge all the carefree periods of my life; maybe i would be ready, facing certain death, to make a reckoning, agree that i had known many of the best things in life."
19048,cell,"but here in this cell, i can’t accept that my life is over; i can’t settle down to a  reckoning, give good fortune its due."
19049,cell,"reminding me of happy times merely makes the concrete walls seem that much more impenetrable, the air in my cell that much more listless, and joy that much more distant."
19050,interrogation,"i’m sitting on the floor, waiting for nothing at all to happen, or for another interrogation, or for nothing at all, or for another interrogation, or for nothing, or for another interrogation, or for nothing."
19051,cell,"one of the female guards shouts through the hatch in my cell door, “shower time!” at the sound of these words, every particle of my misery evaporates."
19052,guard,i feel almost as if i love the guard who has announced this blessing.
19053,inside,"she drops the blindfold inside, and i leap to pick it up and slip it on."
19054,guard,"thank you.” when we reach what i take to be the showers, the guard pushes me forward."
19055,wall,i remove the blindfold and find myself on a cement floor under a crude water outlet protruding from the concrete-brick wall.
19056,evin,"it’s as pitiless a place as anywhere in evin, but to me, so sick of the stink of my own body, it is heaven."
19057,guard,"i shut the door before removing my prison tunic, then abruptly jump as if a bare electrical wire had been jabbed into my back when the guard kicks the door open."
19058,hole,"as i struggle with my hair in this rather slimy hole of a shower stall, i recall my father’s voice singing kurdish songs to me, wrapping me in a cocoon of enchantment and love."
19059,guard,“time is up!” the guard shouts.
19060,crime,or maybe she knows why i am here and considers protesting against the regime a frightful crime.
19061,evin,"it makes me happy to have showered, to be dressed in clean clothing, even if that clothing is just the drab gray evin uniform."
19062,guard,"the guard grabs my arm more forcefully than she needs to, as if her contempt for me has been exacerbated by my having glimpsed her face."
19063,cell,"back in my cell, my cheerful mood survives."
19064,situation,"any person in my situation, in whatever country that person suffers, under whatever regime, surely strives to create a haven, a secure corner."
19065,cell,"they look forward to the cold corner of a fetid cell, to a niche that a rat would think too filthy to pause in, simply because for a short time, the body, the mind, and the soul can converse, offer one another comfort."
19066,cell,my cell is six feet long by five feet wide.
19067,guard,"strangely, i remain happy, even when the guard swings the door open and prods me forward along the corridor."
19068,interrogation,"i’m frightened as i always am when being taken for interrogation, but the fear is under control."
19069,guard,“how are you today?” i ask the guard.
19070,conviction,his response withers my conviction.
19071,charge,"when will i stop believing that those who are in charge of me here are actually kind people deep down, people who will respond courteously to a polite inquiry?"
19072,ordered,"by the time i’m ordered to stop walking, i’m trembling again."
19073,inside,"the door is opened, i’m pushed inside."
19074,interrogation,"as weak and pathetic as i felt just outside the door, i’m worse once in the interrogation room."
19075,police,"but then a slow anger begins to brew in my stomach, for as disgraceful as these lies are, this piece of paper is what the fat man and the police and the mullahs intend to wave under the noses of my friends and teachers, perhaps show to my parents, maybe even publish in a newspaper."
19076,guard,"“asadi!” he yells, calling for the guard."
19077,guard,"the guard flings the door open, looks at me, then at the fat man."
19078,taken,"when all the length has been taken from my hair, the fat man starts in with electric shears, pushing the blades roughly over my scalp."
19079,possession,"to lift my eyes, look this man in the face, and show that i will remain in possession of my dignity no matter what he does—no, i do not have courage of that sort."
19080,guard,"the guard puts the blindfold on my eyes, unties my hands, and urges me to my feet."
19081,cell,"i have no strength to move my legs, and the guard has to part carry, part drag, and part push me back to my cell."
19082,sink,"i drop the blindfold out through the slot for him, then sink to the floor."
19083,guard,"when the guard’s steps recede, i moan ali reza’s name and he answers."
19084,interrogation,he knows that i’ve been to interrogation.
19085,interrogation,just another interrogation.” “did they hit you?” “no.
19086,where,where’s the solace in that?
19087,cell,"i need someone who can provide something even more  comforting—a key to the door of my cell, a second key to the gate of the prison, a car to carry me to some place where the police and interrogators can never find me."
19088,inside,my whole body itches with the irritation of hairs that have fallen inside my prison tunic.
19089,inside,"not on the inside, on the outside."
19090,building,a character-building opportunity?
19091,question,"but by the time i’d completed high school and a year at tehran university, i had studied enough history to know that every country has its mullahs, every country has its dogmatists and zealots, every country has at some time brought down an iron fist on those who question, coax, condemn, criticize."
19092,war,i didn’t know of the reign of joseph mccarthy in early post–world war ii america; i hadn’t heard the term witch hunt applied metaphorically.
19093,police,"it was not that i was lost in fantasizing over a wildly handsome spaniard (who happened to be gay, not that i knew that) but rather that my developing sense of justice was nourished by the story (at least the short, less complicated version) of his artistic and political commitment, a commitment that eventually cost him his life at the hands of licensed police thugs."
19094,justice,"when i reflect on the psychological process that led me into the streets to shout and argue, i always get back to that word, justice."
19095,justice,"like most children, i grew up with a very strong sense of justice."
19096,justice,but isn’t it wonderful how the belief in justice endures?
19097,justice,"for a number of my fellow persians, justice was god."
19098,justice,"for me, at the age of nineteen, justice was the right of girls like myself to exercise their powers and abilities and talents without the interference of the clergy."
19099,freedom,my freedom to walk down the street with the wind in my hair wouldn’t have meant a thing unless all persian girls could do the same.
19100,liberty,how can liberty ever be a privilege?
19101,freedom,i suppose dalí’s conception of freedom was simply too weird for me.
19102,liberty,my idea of liberty was simple enough to be  thought primitive almost.
19103,bully,"but some numskull of a boy in his late teens, licensed by the mullahs of my country to bully me when my scarf slipped an inch too far off my forehead, to lecture me, menace me—well, that was intolerable."
19104,justice,"i read as many of garcía lorca’s plays and poems as i could lay my hands on, and while i read, i felt the quickening of that sense of justice i spoke about."
19105,imprisonment,"but i absorbed the sensibility behind the stories and poems, a sensibility that created vivid images of struggle, of the soul’s imprisonment, and of freedom."
19106,liberty,the struggle was for liberty; that was how i conceived it.
19107,liberty,"i think most people who find themselves shaking their fists at the mullahs of their countries first find a person, often a writer, who helps them define what they mean by liberty."
19108,liberty,"even when the subject is disguised, the real theme of good poetry is liberty, at least in my opinion."
19109,power,i have never read a fine poem or story that condoned repression and rejoiced in the unfettered power of mullahs.
19110,liberty,the liberty of language had found its way into my heart years before garcía lorca came into my life.
19111,state,"i read in a state of ecstatic transport—novels, film magazines, newspapers, books on politics."
19112,authority,"more concealed were the books by sadeq hedayat and mohammad ali jamalzadeh, great heroes of contemporary persian literature, novelists who were truly subversive of authority in both their politics and their insistence on employing simple, clear prose that did not hide its meaning."
19113,conviction,"the theme i was searching for was given focus by garcía lorca, then by the basiji, but it was only when i saw my cousin in the hospital, most of her skin burned from her body, that i truly developed a conviction about justice."
19114,state,i’d thought of her as one of those people for whom joy was a normal state of being.
19115,question,"the usual comforting clichés one would offer to a patient—“get well soon,” “don’t worry, you’re in good hands”—were obviously out of the question."
19116,death,"if you saturate yourself with gasoline and strike a flame, you are not simply crying out for help; you are crying out for death."
19117,where,"sometime later i saw a semidocumentary film by dariush mehrjui set in ilam, a city in the west of iran where ten girls and young women commit suicide each month."
19118,murder,"self-immolation becomes a serial suicide note, each victim saying, in effect, “my motive is the same as that of those who went before.” unlike in india, where countless young women are put to death in this way by relatives, there is no question of murder in these cases."
19119,death,"in ilam and the sunni western region of iran, young women have chosen death by fire over life."
19120,roads,"even if i know the roads, i will never get to córdoba."
19121,death,"death is looking at me, from the towers of córdoba."
19122,death,"oh, death awaits me before i get to córdoba!"
19123,where,"i loved the camaraderie with my teammates, the affection i felt for our coach, and, yes, the lust for victory in a field of endeavor where victory—simple, satisfying—was at least a possibility!"
19124,court,i walked onto the court in a state of rage.
19125,court,"sima, our coach, took me out of the game and wouldn’t let me back on the court."
19126,court,"then i took the ball and ran up and down the court, over and over, firing the ball into the wall and howling."
19127,sink,"he pushes down on my shoulders, and i sink to a sitting position."
19128,interrogation,this is the first interrogation since my hair was shorn.
19129,abuse,"the list might commence with verbal abuse, then graduate to physical abuse, humiliation, shearing—then what?"
19130,torture,more ancient methods of torture?
19131,conviction,i have conceded that i lack the bravery or the conviction to endure anything of that sort.
19132,rape,"it sickens me instantly that he should feel himself entitled to refer to my mother in the familiar manner as “mom.” it is as if  someone preparing to rape me should have the temerity to refer to what he is doing as “making love.” “my mother?” “yes, your mom comes here every day."
19133,gate,she begs the guys at the gate for news of you.
19134,punishment,"we tell her we’ve never seen you, never heard of you.” i think words that i can’t utter—vile, disgusting creature—but i keep my mouth shut not out of fear of punishment but because such a response is what he is looking for."
19135,evin,"i can see with perfect clarity in my mind’s eye what my mother would look like pleading at the gate of evin for news of me—her eyes wet, her lips pale as they are when she is full of anxiety, her beautiful face distorted."
19136,torture,"i sit here expecting something bad, but it never occurs to me that they will use my mother’s misery as a weapon of torture."
19137,imprisonment,"he puts a series of questions to me, all concerning the recent student protests at tehran university that i took part in, protests that focused on the dismissal and imprisonment of two professors, one of them a favorite of mine who taught a version of iran’s history unacceptable to the regime."
19138,torture,"not one of them would break down, even under torture."
19139,question,"before i get angry, answer my question."
19140,cell,“please take me to my cell!” he doesn’t answer.
19141,charge,who was in charge?
19142,question,"sometimes when i think i am answering one question, i realize that the interrogator has moved on to the next one."
19143,conviction,where is my conviction?
19144,toilet,"“can i please go to the toilet?” i ask, but the interrogator persists with his questions."
19145,conviction,"here i sit, sick with fatigue, sustaining myself in the very limited way i can by recalling the tenderness of my father while at the same time relinquishing any pretense i had of honest conviction."
19146,question,i will not permit you to ask her one question more.
19147,guard,i am her father.” a further age passes before the interrogator calls the guard.
19148,cell,i am being taken back to my cell.
19149,toilet,i ask the guard to let me use the toilet on the way.
19150,sink,"i wash my chin at the sink, lifting my blindfold to do so."
19151,cell,"back in my cell, i sit thinking of ali reza in the cell above."
19152,cell,that is why he was put in the cell above me.
19153,interrogation,"he must be away at interrogation, or if he is the spy, then he must be away reporting to  his masters, receiving instructions."
19154,cell,"as soon as i close my eyes, i hear a groan from ali reza’s cell above."
19155,where,"a few minutes ago, i didn’t want to hear from ali reza, now i feel bereft that he is not where he should be."
19156,cell,"“i’m in the lower cell,” i whisper."
19157,interrogation,"“i just had a long interrogation,” i tell this ill-mannered man."
19158,cell,"when i wake, i hear the madman kicking on the door of his cell and screaming obscenities at the country’s political leaders, at khamenei, rafsanjani, khatami."
19159,cell,"an outburst like this can have only one ending, and, sure enough, within a minute i hear the guards thudding down the corridor above and crashing open the cell door."
19160,cell,i doubt if so much as a second has passed between the opening of the cell door and the beating.
19161,cell,at last the cell door above slams shut.
19162,question,he doesn’t reply when i repeat my question.
19163,building,"i can feel a type of hysteria building, as if the madman’s moaning has infected me."
19164,war,"iran was just emerging from its savage war with iraq at that time, and, as with almost all nations in time of war, those in power defined and redefined patriotic behavior."
19165,war,there is nothing new about this: it was just the same in sparta during the peloponnesian war.
19166,death,"in chile during the rule of the junta, teenagers who wore sneakers identified themselves as sympathizers with the left and became targets of the death squads who cruised the streets of santiago."
19167,war,so i imagine that the pious lawmakers simply thought black was the only color that adequately honored the war martyrs.
19168,pleaded,"kids pleaded with the teachers watching over us, “miss, i didn’t know!"
19169,question,"the principal had to assure us that the decree applied only from the date of its announcement, which was a great relief, because it was by no means out of the question in iran for tests of patriotism to be backdated."
19170,offenders,"well, the school took the decree seriously, and the offenders were punished severely."
19171,sentence,"the sentence could take the form of corporal punishment (the cane, just as in english public schools when wretched boys made a mistake of comparable inanity), but the most feared sanction was public shaming."
19172,question,"in the immediate aftermath of the decree, i began to question just a tiny bit whether the martyrs were really going to be offended by white socks."
19173,justice,a sense of justice can always benefit from a complementary sense of the ridiculous.
19174,conviction,"fear enfeebles conviction, obviously; the cost of saying what you believe is often too high a price to pay."
19175,conviction,but another enemy of conviction is ego.
19176,state,"the play was considered a wonderful piece of work by my more conventional teachers, replete with condemnations of the pahlavis and exhortations to “the people” to keep the rulers of the state ever in their hearts and prayers."
19177,conviction,"i might have argued myself out of all genuine conviction but for the example set by some of my teachers, particularly mrs. azimi."
19178,trial,teaching history in the islamic republic was even  more of a trial.
19179,war,"just as modern-day primary and secondary students in japan are offered a version of their nation’s role in the second world war that glosses over embarrassing and inconvenient events (the rape of nanjing, for example, and the murder of hundreds of thousands of chinese and korean civilians), history texts in the islamic republic offer a version of iran’s history that endorses the regime’s take on things without reference to facts, or at least to disinterestedly agreed-on accounts."
19180,where,"i know, of course, that there are seldom incontestable answers when it comes to questions in history such as who did what, when, where, and why."
19181,police,"i had not read arthur koestler’s darkness at noon, with its portrait of the soviet regime’s thought police."
19182,nazi,i had not studied the show trials of nazi germany.
19183,serving,i had not taken enough interest in british history to discern the self-serving fictions of successive british governments on the question of ireland.
19184,liberty,this liberty of inquiry is explained partly by persian custom and partly by the philosophy that underpins islam.
19185,freedom,"and there is a third explanation for the freedom granted to philosophy teachers: the regime correctly judged that philosophy was harmless without contemporary examples to illustrate or support its contentions, and all illustrations were subject to scrutiny and embargo."
19186,question,"she encouraged us to doubt and question, but she didn’t participate in debates."
19187,cell,"if i happen to be sitting in my cell in a daze, as i am often, i can lose track of the last prayer call."
19188,cell,the blindfold is dropped into my cell through the little slot.
19189,taken,"this means i’ll be taken out, i’ll be interrogated again."
19190,guard,i must have the blindfold on by the time the guard opens the door or i will be punished.
19191,cell,"dear god, they can do anything …” the guard grabs my arm and pulls me out of the cell."
19192,case,"“where are you taking me?” i plead, even though it’s a foolish question; the guard is not likely to give me any information, and in any case, where could he be taking me other than the interrogation room?"
19193,taken,i think what i am trying to ask him is whether i am being taken to somewhere more dreadful.
19194,prisoners,"in my spanish studies, i read of republican prisoners in something of the same situation recalling how important it was to know if they were being  taken to execution."
19195,guard,the guard pushes me forward.
19196,interrogation,"somehow, my senses tell me that we are not following the regular route to the interrogation room."
19197,guard,"the guard nudges me, but i remain motionless."
19198,where,“where are you taking me?
19199,where,"where?” “to a nice café,” he says and gives a little grunt of a laugh."
19200,where,where are you taking me?” he doesn’t answer.
19201,guard,"but the guard whacks me hard on the shoulder, and my legs respond instinctively to avoid further pain."
19202,guard,the guard is now dragging me.
19203,guard,i can hear the guard opening a door.
19204,cell,he pushes me into what i assume to be a cell somewhere in this city of a prison.
19205,guard,"the same foolish instinct that made me stop in the corridor compels me to struggle against the bonds on my wrists, but the guard has no difficulty in overcoming my resistance."
19206,guard,he is much stronger than i. i hear the guard’s footfalls on the floor.
19207,torture,"first, i imagine the most appalling thing—rape—then things that are less horrifying—a beating, torture."
19208,taken,"i doubt i would be so terrified if i had been taken to the usual room, questioned by either of the interrogators i have had before."
19209,abuse,"it’s mad, but i begin to long for the room i am used to, for the abuse i am familiar with, for the stink of the fat man’s breath, which i know and abhor."
19210,guard,that would appeal to the sense of humor of the cretins who guard this place.
19211,stretch,"i want to rouse my shoulders and stretch them, lift my behind from the seat of the chair, raise my legs."
19212,confinement,"i think of people who have withstood solitary confinement for long, long periods, for months or even years."
19213,conviction,"extraordinary resources of character and conviction, they must have."
19214,where,they don’t remember where i am.
19215,where,"one guard is saying to another, “that stupid girl, that zarah what’sher-name, where did you put her?” “is anyone here?” i whisper."
19216,prisoner,i am a prisoner here!
19217,where,where have they gone?
19218,torture,"no beatings, no torture, just letting a person sit in a chair?"
19219,state,"in a normal, relaxed state, respiration through the nostrils is sustaining."
19220,state,"in a state of terrified arousal, the absolute removal of the option to breathe through one’s mouth is physically traumatizing."
19221,pleading,"each muscle, hundreds of them, is pleading for relief."
19222,death,"i don’t mean death, just an end to what my body, both the outside of it and the inside and the stuff in my brain, is enduring."
19223,torture,i know now that what i had thought of as neglect is in fact a form of torture.
19224,torture,the sitting-anddoing-nothing torture.
19225,cell,i can hear a cell door being opened.
19226,cell,is it my cell?
19227,cell,this could be my cell.
19228,cell,"this might be where they have been dragging me, to  my cell, my home."
19229,cell,the weird man in the upper cell stops moaning.
19230,where,i can smell it from where i’m lying on my blanket.
19231,punishment,this was punishment!
19232,pen,i use my finger as a pen and write messages to myself or else just my name on my skull.
19233,situation,"but not in any crucial situation, and not when anything that you hope to rely on all through life, like your soul and its influence over you, is involved."
19234,where,"“she did, long and black, but she was a bitch.” “where did you meet her?” i ask."
19235,question,"i have asked him this question before, more than once, sometimes idly, sometimes out of genuine interest, sometimes just to shut him up."
19236,where,"no, i mean those who dream, those who tell stories to themselves that they believe because of the beauty of the telling, those who use words to make roses bloom in the desert, where the sun has baked the soil black and red."
19237,court,"it draws its nourishment up through roots that have burrowed deep down for thousands of years, roots that clasp the bones of darius and his court poets, that curl through the relics of dancing girls who smeared kohl around their eyes and perfumed their hair and made their flesh glisten with scented oils."
19238,taken,mrs. mohammadi had so drenched herself in the language that she had taken on its color and shimmer.
19239,power,"through the weakness of nature, i was unable to support the power of the day’s sun and was forced to seek shelter in the shade of a wall, hoping with all my heart that some passing stranger with a pitying heart would relieve the cruel thirst i suffered and cool the flames that consumed me with the balm of water."
19240,justice,"nushirwan said to the slave, “see that you pay for what you take, lest it become a custom to take without paying and the village be ruined.” said the slave, “oh, master, what harm will such a small quantity cause?” nushirwan replied, “the origin of injustice in the world was at first small, and everyone that came added to it, until it reached the magnitude we behold today.”  whenever possible, mrs. mohammadi turned her light on the theme of justice and injustice in sa‘di and hafez and rumi."
19241,justice,"but she allowed us to see that the greatest things said about justice and injustice in our language stood in strong contrast to the far pettier and coarser things said about justice and injustice and right and wrong by the mullahs, or at least by the mullahs of the regime."
19242,cell,and justice is being served when the girl who let the sun touch her hair is pushed into a dark cell and beaten?
19243,injustice,"once literature has thrilled you deeply, you cannot imagine those who created it rejoicing in injustice, employing their pens to make sonnets that celebrate hypocrisy."
19244,power,"nor inflict on your enemy every injury that is in your power, as he may someday become your friend."
19245,death,"i mean not the exhortation to drown your sorrows in wine but the deeper message, asking us to look at life not as rigorous preparation for a second life, a life after death, but as an end in itself."
19246,conviction,"or not entirely an end in itself but a period of seeing and breathing and tasting and loving permitted by our senses and limbs and lips, which it would be folly to abjure out of a conviction of a greater delight to follow."
19247,state,"for the first fifteen hundred years of persia’s existence, zoroastrianism was the state religion, and so, by embracing persia’s past, i also embrace the roots of my religion."
19248,establishment,"i don’t believe that the arab and mongol invasions of persia between 633 and the thirteenth century and the establishment of islam in my ancient country destroyed the persian sensibility; no, up until the triumph of fundamentalism in iran in 1979, the spiritual beauty of islam coexisted with the beauty that prevailed before the coming of islam."
19249,where,"in schools, persian history was taught without distortion, unlike in postrevolutionary iran, where the mullahs seem to hold the pre-islamic era in contempt."
19250,cell,"we have been chatting in a desultory way for a half hour, and it just seems weird to me that the man in the cell above me is here for theft or embezzlement or passing false checks while i am here for shouting in the street."
19251,question,i repeat my question.
19252,abuse,you begin to howl day and night and rain abuse down on the heads of your loved ones?
19253,cell,"in a year or five years, will i be the madwoman in the cell above some newcomer, abusing the guards for the sake of the pitiable intimacy of a beating?"
19254,rape,"if you yell, they will come and rape you."
19255,cell,"they raped miriam, she was in your cell before you."
19256,taken,"the two words, “ten years,” have taken over my brain, my lungs, my throat, my mouth."
19257,guard,"the guard drops the blindfold in through the slot, and it falls almost soundlessly to the floor."
19258,interrogation,i immediately stop worrying about the more distant future and start thinking about what is waiting for me in the interrogation room today.
19259,interrogation,"i walk haltingly into the interrogation room, blind as usual."
19260,where,“where were we?” he asks himself in a businesslike way.
19261,question,“were you being supported by any antigovernment organizations overseas?” hasn’t he asked this question before?
19262,fugitive,"and did arash hazrati have any friends or connections with iranian tv channels in l.a. or radio stations in london?” people’s sense of humor is so fugitive, so prepared to hide itself until the chance comes to smile."
19263,case,"and in any case, as if any of us would watch the channels he’s talking about."
19264,jail,"and if they had the chance, they would be doing exactly what the regime is doing:  throwing people into jail."
19265,question,"you know what i mean, don’t you?” “yes.” “another question."
19266,charge,"they know very well that he is the one who matters: not because he is in charge, because he isn’t, but because of his courage, his persistence."
19267,interrogation,i have a sickening sense that he intends to take my interrogation in a direction i don’t want to contemplate.
19268,inside,"as his chanting goes on, his spittle wetting the inside of my ear, i realize something that i must have been groping toward for weeks: i am the beginning and the end of what interests him; not any information i can provide, just my pleas."
19269,captive,"in my spanish studies, i read of the practice of the incas of peru when they took captive a high-born enemy."
19270,inside,"inside me, when the hacking subsides, there is nothing but a loathing for life, for all life, for my own."
19271,cell,he calls for the guard as he always does when it is time for me to be taken back to my cell.
19272,cell,"sometime later, i am back in my cell."
19273,interrogation,"they finish, they begin to work on someone else, they don’t even think of you until the next interrogation."
19274,pleading,"i make very sure i don’t think of the details of what was hissed into my ear, of the degradation  of all those women, of their agonies, their helpless pleading."
19275,cell,my brain is still as unwilling to accept the world as it was when i laid on the floor of the interrogation cell.
19276,death,"in all truth, i can’t even say it is death that i wish for; death is simply the closest thing to it."
19277,toilet,i put the green paper out to go to the toilet.
19278,guard,half an hour later the guard drops the blindfold in.
19279,guard,i pray for an argument or a fight with the guard.
19280,guard,“i think you people are all sick and disgusting!” i shriek as the guard pushes me along.
19281,abuse,"curled on the concrete floor, i scream out my abuse."
19282,where,the guard kicks me where i lie.
19283,guard,but the fury that boils in my brain is somehow served by having enraged this guard.
19284,guard,"another guard, a woman by the sound of her cries, has come to stop the beating."
19285,toilet,"when we reach the toilet, i tear off my blindfold and begin howling, all of my hatred and fury and disgust with the interrogator and disgust with myself channeling itself into this fit."
19286,toilet,i am staring at the back of the toilet door.
19287,prisoners,this is where messages are left by other prisoners.
19288,evin,the fact that the lines are scratched here means that arash is now in evin himself.
19289,arrested,this is no shock to me; it had become obvious that he would be arrested soon.
19290,case,"i have brought with me my spoon, secretly kept back when i returned my food tray in case i ever wished to leave a message here."
19291,cell,"i replace my blindfold, conceal my spoon, and go back to my cell."
19292,jail,"i happen to know that the poet himself was a protester, and that he spent years in jail."
19293,interrogation,it’s been a few days with no interrogation.
19294,murder,what i think of now is murder.
19295,murder,murder.
19296,murder,"when i sleep, i dream about murder."
19297,murder,"i murder the interrogator in my dreams, but the blows i inflict don’t kill him."
19298,power,fantasies of power.
19299,death,"the door is swung open, and there stands the interrogator, the man i have been putting to death over and over, the man who screams for mercy after i have struck him to the floor and stand above him with my knife raised."
19300,guard,but no guard.
19301,torture,i know from  the whispers outside of evin that the methods of torture at the disposal of men like the interrogator go as far as torture can possibly go.
19302,inmates,what complaints of inhuman abuse were made by the inmates of nazi death camps as they waited for the end?
19303,torture,"it is meant to satisfy the feelings of the doctor, in case the doctor should believe that the interrogator is just a regular guy going about his rounds, but at the same time the smile acts as an instrument of torture on me, a more effective instrument than a gloating laugh."
19304,prisoner,"the two of us, one a madman with a brain so abused that he doesn’t even know how many years have passed since he was anything other than a prisoner of evin, the other a madwoman keeping herself alive on bloodthirsty fantasies, and both of us laughing."
19305,taken,"i can’t tell if sohrab has taken offense, since he is silent."
19306,question,"then, just when i am beginning to feel that my despair has chased away the only voice i can rely on, the madman asks me a question."
19307,cell,"“did you kill someone?” “no,” i answer, quite startled, for it is as if my fantasies of murder have seeped out of my brain like a colorless gas and drifted up through the fan grille into sohrab’s cell."
19308,murder,"do i sound like i murder people?” “i did,” says sohrab."
19309,crime,"my fascination has to do with a hope that the victim of my lovely madman’s crime was a prison guard or, even better, an interrogator."
19310,crimes,"here i am, listening to a lunatic telling of his crimes as a spur to my own sick appetites."
19311,cell,i begin to feel that i would slap him and beat him and make him tell me if i could walk into his cell.
19312,sentence,i am enthralled from his first sentence.
19313,question,i don’t even question the truth of what he is saying.
19314,where,where did you go for your honeymoon?” “no honeymoon.
19315,evin,evin is heaven.
19316,court,"so i broke in the office one night to collect what i needed to take to the court, but i got arrested by security and the rest is history.” “you haven’t told me what made you hate leila.” “she swore in court that she’d seen me taking drugs, and she said i was violent and that i’d threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone.” “but she loved you."
19317,court,you said she did.” “i saw her in the court for the last time.
19318,killing,i couldn’t find leila.” “did you feel any better after killing him?” this was something i wanted to know.
19319,murder,i think about justifications for murder.
19320,murder,"i don’t believe that sohrab had the right to murder leila, even if he’d found her that night, but i think i have the right to murder the man i despise."
19321,court,i’m not in court.
19322,murder,i just want to murder someone who wouldn’t even be missed by his mother.
19323,case,"my father adored each of us and found some special way of showing it; in my case, as i’ve said, by brushing my hair as i sat on his lap and crooning sweet songs into my ear."
19324,state,"the shah’s antagonism toward the clergy was even more personal; there has never been a formally legislated division of church and state in iran, only a de facto division, ramped up steadily by the shah from the beginning of his reign."
19325,power,"despising communists is one thing—everybody in islamic iran other than the communists themselves despised them, atheists that they were—but despising the clergy, and finding ways, year by year, to erode their power and influence reflected the shah’s ambition for a semisecular iran to take its place among the more sophisticated nations of the world."
19326,case,"in any case, the great majority of iranians are muslims before almost anything else."
19327,power,enraging the clergy was never going to strengthen his hold on power.
19328,where,"out in the countryside, where most iranians lived, the mullahs planted seeds of hatred for pahlavi and watered the ground assiduously."
19329,police,"the shah could not rely on the love of the people to remain on the throne; he relied instead on a highly effective secret police force and on the security agency, savak."
19330,torture,"details of interrogation were also revealed, including methods of torture."
19331,torture,i know perfectly well that the world is used to stories of sons and daughters passionately disputing the reputed involvement of their fathers in shocking episodes of murder and torture.
19332,power,many were carted off to be subjected to the very torments they had sanctioned while in power.
19333,repression,"he might have accepted the repression of the communists without too much angst, but i doubt he would have approved at all of the way the clergy was abused—he is, after all, a man of faith."
19334,war,"i have read of certain german army officers in world war ii returning from business in the east of the country, and even farther east, in other countries, conquered countries, who were never quite the same again."
19335,question,"but whatever the facts, i didn’t accept either my father or my mother as a reliable witness to the shah’s regime once i was old enough to question."
19336,war,let me go forward from the war years of the 1980s to the middle of the next decade.
19337,war,the islamic revolution has survived the war with iraq and consolidated itself all over iran.
19338,state,"it is the anniversary of the islamic revolution of february 1979, and the state channel is showing its version of the pahlavi overthrow."
19339,repression,now the program switches back to scenes of repression under the shah.
19340,evin,mothers gather at the gates of evin prison to plead for news of husbands and sons thought to be held inside.
19341,officers,"she tells me of the annual gatherings of senior military officers and their families on the grounds of the imperial  palace in north tehran, all invited by the shah as an expression of his gratitude for their diligence and loyalty."
19342,wall,"on the wall behind mom hangs a set of shelves on which my travel souvenirs are displayed, for i am an irremediably soppy collector of knickknacks from iranian destinations: a statuette of darius the  great from shiraz, ceramics from esfahan, a little wooden ship from the caspian coast."
19343,power,"if he wants to speak of the old days, it is usually to make a political point, comparing suffrage under the shah with the mock-suffrage of the mullahs, who reserve a power of veto over anything the electorate might endorse (and so did the shah, but his vetoes were “more sensible,” whatever that means—but best not mention that)."
19344,serving,"no, i am the best listener, although my listening this evening is utterly self-serving."
19345,guilty,"i don’t want them to worry, but even more than that, i don’t want either of them to say, “no more, it’s too dangerous!” if they say that, i won’t obey, and if i don’t obey, i will feel guilty."
19346,guilty,it seems to me that feeling guilty about fighting for a good cause is too much to ask of myself.
19347,cell,17 i am lying on my stinky blanket in my cell tortured by an idea so disturbing that it is making me tremble.
19348,death,"an opportunity comes for me to say something that shows whose side i am on politically, and i squeak something out—nothing so arresting as “death to the mullahs!” but something that is meant to convey my thoughtfulness and also my amazing wit."
19349,war,you sound like one of those kids who signed up for martyrdom in the war—those kids who couldn’t wait to die for the cause.
19350,where,"in spite of adopting this new posture of extreme cool, i still follow arash around like a puppy dog, stopping where he stops, starting again when he starts."
19351,where,"see, this is the trouble with reading a bit of freud—you begin to see ten possible motives where there was only one before."
19352,death,"three days ago i was sick to death of arash, and brimming with scorn for his birds and poems and his rallying calls."
19353,arrested,"he has been arrested a number of times, so the interrogators will be merciless with him, yet he somehow found the strength to leave me a message of encouragement."
19354,torture,we all know that torture works.
19355,tortured,"okay, you tortured her, she would have said anything to make you stop."
19356,where,"where your dignity was, there is only fear screeching for rescue, like rats in a cage screeching for release."
19357,state,we are also in favor of separation of church and state.
19358,law,"let the priests and mullahs make the law within their cathedrals and mosques, and let those who enter there obey the laws of the mosques and cathedrals."
19359,state,"once outside, let the muslims and christians and jews observe the laws of a secular state."
19360,case,"but in ellie’s case, the message of the mullahs got through."
19361,inside,"you will go to hell.” “zarah,” she censured me when she saw me indoors without my burka, dressed in jeans and a top that showed my middle, “god can see inside.” being lectured by a fourteen-year-old can be charming, if maddening, but ellie had no intention of charming anyone."
19362,law,"her business was to save souls, and she had no doubt as to how to go about it because her teachers at school, her teachers on the radio and on television, her teachers at the  mosque had provided her with a simple program of salvation: when you see the law of god ignored, speak up."
19363,abuse,"if someone important to her—some revered ayatollah, some gray-whiskered bigot—was talking on the television, i excused my conscience from contributing a volley of abuse."
19364,sentenced,"we would see on the news that some poor young girl had been sentenced to death for having an affair, and we would shake our heads, or put a hand over our eyes, or simply sigh deeply and mutter something like “dreadful!” we lived in a circle of shared sympathies."
19365,trial,practices that were as merciless (and made about as much sense) as medieval trial by ordeal appeared perfectly just to ellie.
19366,rape,an  example would be her acceptance of the legal requirement for a male family member to confirm any charge of rape that a woman might make.
19367,law,"her aunt, divorced from an intolerable bully of a husband, asked ellie in my hearing if she was happy with the way “your people” made it impossible for her to see her own children—for that is the law in iran; you can get a divorce if you’re a woman, but you have to say goodbye to the kids."
19368,insane,"there stood her aunt, dark circles under her eyes, half insane with grief, never a better opportunity for ellie to murmur some reservations."
19369,question,"give me a teacher, please, who is sometimes beset by doubt, who might answer your question by saying, “i’ll have to go away and think about that.” take my beloved omar khayyám."
19370,toilet,"19 i have put out the green slip of paper to show the guard that i need to go to the toilet, but he isn’t paying any attention."
19371,cell,"i pace up and down my cell— three short steps one way, three steps back—clutching my bladder."
19372,toilet,"it’s not as though i am likely to make a run for it on the way to the toilet, overpower armed guards, steal keys to a half dozen doors."
19373,cell,"if the guard doesn’t come soon, i’ll have to go on the floor of the cell."
19374,guard,"“please!” i whimper, not so much for the guard as for god."
19375,cell,"please let me hold on to this last thing, the feeling that i can keep my cell clean, just this last thing!"
19376,cell,would it matter if the floor of my cell was wet?
19377,cell,how could the cell smell worse than it does in any case?
19378,cell,the cell belongs to me.
19379,interrogation,"even when they finish with me after an interrogation, i come back to this tiny place and it’s mine."
19380,cell,"but please, just let my cell be clean!"
19381,guard,"ten seconds pass, and many more, hundreds more before the guard comes."
19382,cell,he can easily push me back into the cell and slam the door shut on me again.
19383,toilet,“how many times do you go to the toilet in a day?” he says.
19384,toilet,"you invited yourself.” as soon as i close the toilet door behind me and relieve my aching bladder, i glimpse a message on the back of the door."
19385,guard,i replace the blindfold and step out of the cubicle and into the hands of the guard.
19386,toilet,"“i will take you to the toilet again tonight,” he says quietly."
19387,cell,"thank you.” i stop the tears while i am being escorted back to my cell, but once the door is closed and i have put the blindfold back out through the slot, i let this great storm of emotion have its way with me."
19388,where,i don’t even know where all this stuff is coming from!
19389,evin,these people in evin have beaten all of the girlfriend out of me.
19390,interrogation,another day with no interrogation.
19391,interrogation,"i don’t want an interrogation, so why am i restless?"
19392,exercise,my feet are not only tired but growing soft on the soles through lack of exercise.
19393,cell,pacing up and down my little cell isn’t going to provide them with what they need.
19394,cell,"i sit and look around my cell, switching my gaze from one wall to another, then to the door, then to the floor."
19395,inside,"so when i get to my feet and pace these three short steps one way and three short steps back, it is because some angry and impatient being inside me is saying, “you!"
19396,murder,"what’s the matter with you?” no friendly bug comes to stir my senses, and so i reluctantly allow my brain to indulge in its one recreation: imagining murder."
19397,cell,"sometimes he walks into my cell alone, gloating and snorting, thinking that i am completely at his mercy, but what he doesn’t know is that i have found some way to arm myself with a big hammer, such as those i have seen laborers using when they are replacing cobblestones on the street."
19398,situation,"my situation is—well, it’s just  hopeless!” then, when he is close enough, i bring the hammer out from behind me and smash it down on his melon skull with all my strength."
19399,where,where is sohrab?
19400,taken,have they taken him away to interrogate him?
19401,cell,surely they don’t take him to a cell and torture him just for the pleasure of it!
19402,where,"oh, where is my madman!"
19403,torture,"i ask god to spare him more beatings, more torture."
19404,pleaded,is there some enormous archive somewhere in heaven or hell where all the prayers of those who begged and pleaded are kept?
19405,pleaded,those who prayed and pleaded without hope?
19406,where,"such places still exist in the world, places where visitors, completely unaware, suddenly sense something strange, as if the air above these ancient soils is full of fugitive whispers."
19407,where,"i spent my early years seeking the company of my grandma, both in tehran, where she lived part of the year with my family, and on visits to kermanshah, the great city of kermanshah province, when grandma was staying with my uncle’s family."
19408,law,"her husband had died when she was still quite young, and her children had been taken from her to live with her brother-in-law’s family."
19409,law,"such is the law in iran, and a truly wicked law it is."
19410,charge,"my father has always been a pragmatist, except when it came to the question of leaving iran altogether when the mullahs took charge, in 1979."
19411,death,"when i run into the street and shout and shake my fist, i am not  shouting, “utopia or death!” i am shouting something much humbler: “i want my pink shoes!” that would be enough, for once the mullahs conceded my right to wear pink shoes, so much that is good and wise and kind and just plain human would follow."
19412,law,"i have no argument with islam, not even with the career and progeny of the prophet’s son-in-law ali or with forms of words in the quran; my argument is with the mullahs, and it’s the same argument i would have if i were jewish and were compelled to live a life regulated by an unyielding ultraorthodox regime of jewish mullahs, or if i were catholic and had to listen to a catholic mullah telling me that my flesh exists only to be mortified, or to a buddhist mullah insisting that the joy and excitement of my lover’s kiss is an illusion."
19413,freedom,"my mother’s path to freedom grew out of her convictions, just as mine did, only my path ended in a swamp."
19414,freedom,"for her, as for many women, freedom is love."
19415,captive,"when she strokes my cheeks and frames my face with her palms and holds me captive so that i have no choice but to look her in the eyes, i can feel the roughness of her flesh."
19416,crimes,sharia law—the scriptural law that permits multiple marriage and a wide range of dreadful sanctions for crimes of certain sorts—is thought of in the same way: cruel and degrading.
19417,sharia,"but when my mother was called on by the two wives of our neighbor to make peace, she set aside her feelings about sharia law and did what she always did: looked for a way in which some dignity could be reestablished."
19418,death,"it is always much more difficult for a woman than for a man to say something like “all property should be shared, and those who don’t wish to share must be put to death.” or “it is god’s will that those who  dispute god’s will should be thrown into the flames.” or even “the world does not exist, and those who think it does exist must be disabused.” women hold children in their hands; they wipe the snot from children’s noses; they sit at bedsides soothing the child who has woken from a nightmare."
19419,injustice,"of course, nothing much can be done about injustice if peaceful acceptance of the status quo is forever breaking out, but for women like my mother—versatile, practical, hands-on women—the injustices employed to overcome injustice can be foreseen, and any eventual victory will seem pyrrhic."
19420,justice,my mother knows injustice when she sees it; it is only the path to justice that rouses her doubts and trepidation.
19421,where,"because it didn’t seem possible to me that the fires and the screaming and the bleeding could  have been made to happen on purpose, here where i lived."
19422,case,"zoroastrianism is not a religion of instruction, and in any case, mom would have chosen to walk barefoot across iran on broken glass if that were the only alternative to delivering a lecture."
19423,question,"“azam, you eat beets, i’m sure, but leave them on the plate if you don’t.” if she did need the answer to a question, she would relay the question through me, sparing azam the ordeal of speaking."
19424,injustice,"it’s only now, as i write, that i understand the terrible distress i caused my mother when i went into the street to shake my fist at injustice."
19425,injustice,"the gentle advice she had been offering me all her life without ever making a bold statement about it was that injustice has to be countered in a subtle, almost a stealthy way."
19426,where,"as i grew older and better understood how azam’s father humiliated her, i wanted to go next door and tell arman agha to go to hell, where he belonged."
19427,injustice,"and when i spoke of the injustice of the mullahs, mom would look at me in that embarrassed way parents have when they notice in the child they love with all their hearts something that in another person they would abhor."
19428,where,"where he has been and what has been done to him he doesn’t say, and i don’t ask."
19429,wall,or hit their heads on the wall to see their own blood.
19430,case,"in any case, i have stopped worrying about my looks."
19431,toilet,"bad food makes me beautiful.”  “i have to go to the toilet,” i tell sohrab."
19432,toilet,“will you talk to me again when i get back?” “maybe.” “say yes or no!” “do you think that you can make me do what you want by being bossy?” “i want you to talk to me when i get back from the toilet.
19433,toilet,"all the way to the toilet, i think only about sohrab."
19434,cell,"if sohrab was talking to someone else, perhaps in the cell above him, i would be mad with jealousy."
19435,torture,"the idea of something worse than beating, torture, makes me wild, as if i could kill the people who would harm him, with my hands and with whatever i could pick up."
19436,toilet,there’s no message from arash on the toilet door.
19437,sink,"i drink water from the sink tap, as sohrab told me i must."
19438,evin,he knows how the whole of evin works.
19439,cell,"for a moment, i find myself wishing that it was arash in the cell above me instead of sohrab, because arash knows me from the outside world."
19440,cell,"i can imagine his will and resolve, which he never brags about, seeping down to me, reviving me, so that when the guard comes to take me for interrogation, i could smile sardonically and mutter something like “another glorious day in evin!” and walk out of the cell with my shoulders square and my head held high."
19441,cell,"on the way back to the cell, a new guard, a woman, surprises me with a question."
19442,cell,"you’ll change your mind.” back in my cell, i take a few minutes to think about what the new guard has been saying."
19443,evin,are there such people here in evin?
19444,guard,“i’ve gone for a walk in the garden.” i tell sohrab about the new guard and what she offered me.
19445,cell,"if you make a deal, they’ll come to your cell and rape you."
19446,guard,my brain wanted to believe that the new guard was different.
19447,guard,"i wanted her to be a kind guard, somebody more like the human beings i’ve known most of my life."
19448,guard,first come the footfalls of a guard walking along the corridor alone.
19449,guard,the limping guard; i know his irregular signature.
19450,guard,i don’t know if he is talking to himself or to another guard.
19451,prisoners,"i hear the remote weeping sound that’s there all the time, and as always i try to work out if the weeping is that of a real person or something piped in to get on the nerves of the prisoners, the muzak of the interrogators."
19452,case,"my hearing is so acute now that i can tell whether a door opening or closing is on this floor or the floor above or the floor below, and whether it is at the end of a corridor or halfway along, or at the top of some steps, in which case it echoes."
19453,evin,and so i suppose i can’t say that my time in evin has been totally wasted.
19454,evin,"oh, and isn’t that another thing the evin academy has taught me?"
19455,evin,"it’s impossible to escape from evin, or that is what is said on the outside, and now that i’m inside i have no doubt that what is said is perfectly true."
19456,murder,"my escape fantasy is not like my murder fantasies, which demand a fully alert brain."
19457,murder,"the escape fantasy is a movie i’ve put together, and while the murder fantasies always leave me quivering with self-disgust, the escape movie makes me happy and there’s no disgust to deal with afterward."
19458,where,"in the opening scene, i am lying here exactly where i am."
19459,cell,a flash of orange light shines for a second through the gap at the bottom of the cell door.
19460,cell,"oh, my god, the shouting is so close to my cell now!"
19461,case,"i scream out, “i’m here!” i must arm myself, in case i have to join in the fighting."
19462,cell,i find two pistols in the corner of my cell.
19463,cell,the door of my cell is blasted open.
19464,cell,“how did arash get out of his cell?
19465,where,where did his guns come from?
19466,cell,and what on earth are those pistols and the hammer doing in your cell?
19467,state,i am in a state of readiness for whatever these bastards have waiting for me.
19468,evin,i asked sohrab the other day about the special place that is rumored to exist within evin.
19469,torture,"in 1979, the students who supported the ayatollah’s revolution stormed evin and displayed the instruments and devices used by savak in this ultimate torture chamber."
19470,power,"the story goes, though, that when the men of the new regime took power, in 1979, they shot or hanged the savaki bosses, but they kept the torturers, the hands-on people, recognizing that their skills would be valuable in the coming era."
19471,taken,"if i am taken to the special place, i will bargain at every step on the way to its door."
19472,guard,the guard drops the blindfold through the slot in the door.
19473,interrogation,i have never been taken for interrogation this early in the morning.
19474,guard,the guard opens the door and puts what i know to be a chador over my head without saying a word to me.
19475,where,"“where are we going?” i ask the guard, not expecting an answer that means anything."
19476,guard,the guard pushes me forward.
19477,insane,"just this one change to the routine, and i am already half insane."
19478,where,“please tell me where you’re taking me.
19479,guard,"the guard can see or sense how the fear is mounting in me, and he takes my wrist and holds it tight."
19480,evin,"evin is big, but it is not ten stories high."
19481,guard,"the guard pulls on my wrist to get me out of the elevator, but i won’t budge."
19482,hanged,i have seen hanged women on television.
19483,guard,“move!” says the guard.
19484,where,“i don’t know where they’re taking you.
19485,guard,just move!” the guard must think this will calm me.
19486,cell,"take me back to my cell!” the guard slaps me hard on the shoulder, then braces my head and slaps at my face."
19487,guard,“you made me do that!” the guard shouts at me.
19488,guard,then the guard makes me stop and stand still.
19489,where,where is this?
19490,where,where?
19491,evin,"surely this is the back of evin, below the mountains of north tehran."
19492,guard,"the guard says, “bend your knees,” and i do, without any resistance."
19493,inside,"i brush against a figure already seated inside; then the guard urges me along the seat and climbs in himself, so that i am wedged between two people."
19494,guard,"he is responding to someone’s voice, but the guard beside me and the person i think is a woman are not saying a thing."
19495,cell,this must be a conversation on a cell phone.
19496,evin,is it possible that the hidden part of evin is so vast that a car is required to move people around in it?
19497,guard,"the guard i imagine to be female shows that she is indeed female by tutting and fussing with my chador, making it sit properly on my hairless skull."
19498,state,she’s one of those women who get into a high state of excitement by stopping girls in the street and commanding them to straighten their head scarves.
19499,war,"22 by the end of the war with iraq, the wail of the red-alert siren in tehran warning of a missile attack was greeted with a shrug of the shoulders by children like me."
19500,war,"after all, for many of us, war was normal."
19501,case,"inside the case i kept my pajamas, my colored pencils, and a coloring book."
19502,pleading,"many people prayed, too, and the unhurried, rhythmic chanting blended in with shrieks and oaths and shrill laughter and the cries of mothers pleading for some order: “as god is my judge, i’ll take you by your neck and turn your bottom scarlet!” i sat quietly and plied my colored pencils."
19503,where,ambulances were blaring their way to places where people were screaming for help.
19504,death,"and there would surely be an old man who felt he had seen too much of fire and death in his life shaking his fist at the sky, or at fate."
19505,inside,"i was taking great care to stay inside the lines as i concentrated on the figure of the mighty rustam calling to the young man sohrab, whom he was not to know was his beloved son."
19506,where,"twelve years later, in my second year at the university, i again had the opportunity to either stay in the streets, where crowds were shouting and shaking their fists, or retreat to a shelter."
19507,arrested,the protests had only a very local objective—to demand the reinstatement of a university professor who’d been arrested for teaching in a way that was considered subversive by the ministry for education—but we were getting a lot of support from the general public and from some of the bolder newspapers.
19508,justice,"it seemed to me, and to most of my fellow protesters, that the sheer justice of what we were demanding had disarmed the regime politically; that they were scared, unable to look us in the eye and say that we were in the wrong."
19509,power,"after twenty years in power, the regime was exhausted, so we believed."
19510,conviction,"this conviction was foolish, of course, as i came to see; those in power were simply waiting to see how much force would be required to shut us up."
19511,police,"i looked around and saw so many young men and young women, just like me, laughing in the face of the enemy—the enemy this time being the police; the security agents; the stupid boys of the basiji, with their pimples and bad breath and brain-dead fanaticism; the mullahs, the rulers, the nation’s most practiced liars and hypocrites."
19512,state,"we’d been discussing the recent student arrests, and talking of how we would call a rally for the next day right within the precincts of the university to protest this blatantly illegal violation of our rights to state our point of view."
19513,police,a woman in a police uniform stepped out of the car and rapidly demanded to see my identity papers.
19514,police,"even before my papers had been properly studied, i was in the back of the car with the woman officer on one side of me and a male police officer on the other."
19515,police,"i knew that i could be in the worst trouble, that this sort of swoop by the police could end badly for me."
19516,police,"i’d thought that, if the police took an interest in me, they would make an appointment and ask me a few questions, which i’d answer curtly and then go home."
19517,where,"“excuse me,” i said, “where am i being taken, and for what reason?” “the station,” said the woman, without looking at me."
19518,question,i was preparing another question when the driver stopped the car.
19519,pleaded,"he’ll pretend that he understands why i pleaded with the cops, but really, he’ll be disappointed."
19520,pleading,there will be no pleading from me!
19521,illegal,"this is illegal, what they’re doing— illegal!"
19522,lawyer,dad will get me a lawyer.
19523,where,i had no idea where i was being taken.
19524,police,i doubted that i was going to a police station.
19525,police,there are police stations everywhere in tehran.
19526,police,"but if not to a police station, then where?"
19527,detention,it took only a few seconds for me to realize that i was in some big indoor detention center.
19528,officers,"a number of officers were standing around looking jaded, but others were busy at a desk writing on documents or recording information from a pair of young women who stood at the counter."
19529,imprisoned,they would have been gathered up in the big sweeps of the city that the cops and basij militia carry out all through the day and night and brought here to be fined or imprisoned.
19530,custody,"actually, all iranians are argumentative nearly all the time, but these women hadn’t suspended their bad habits just because they were in custody."
19531,arrested,"they demanded to know why they’d been arrested, even though it was obvious."
19532,punishment,"i’d have been happy to share their punishment, happy to share a cell with any of them for a year if necessary."
19533,case,"i remained standing perfectly still, prepared even to forgo shifting my weight from foot to foot in case doing so was taken as a sign of insolence."
19534,detention,"on the far side of the detention room, a tall wire gate was rolled open, and we were hustled inside."
19535,locked,then the gate was shut and locked.
19536,arrested,"please will you call her and tell her i’ve been arrested?” the woman, far from young when i looked at her close up, shook her head unhurriedly."
19537,evin,"“evin,” she said."
19538,officers,"23 once we are out of the car, one of the male officers guides me by prodding me in the small of my back every two steps."
19539,building,"right now, i feel certain that a large building is before me, and, sure enough, i hear the rasp of sliding doors a second before the balm of artificially cooled air wraps itself around my body."
19540,building,i am prodded forward for quite some distance inside the building.
19541,dungeon,"i guard against relaxing my fear, but it does seem that i am in a huge office block; a ministry, perhaps, rather than a dungeon deep in the earth with a scaffold waiting."
19542,evin,"i am moving rapidly, much more rapidly than along the corridors of evin."
19543,suspect,"for a moment, i suspect a trick."
19544,building,"but then the officer deftly slips off my blindfold, and, after blinking against the bright overhead lighting, i see that i am indeed in some sort of office building, and that i am facing a door with a plaque fixed to it, a plaque that is a little higher on one side than the other."
19545,wall,"the door opens, and i am staring ahead at what appears to be a management suite: a table with a smooth surface of artificial woodgrain; plastic chairs with metal legs; large portraits on the wall, khomeini and khamenei, the father of the nation and his successor, identical mullahs’ turbans, identical white beards."
19546,where,where?
19547,where,"i’m staring down at the nails of my bare feet, where a tiny amount of pink nail polish remains."
19548,court,this is a court.
19549,where,is that where i have seen this older man?
19550,sentence,"her voice is very singsong, and she has an irritating way of extending the final syllable of the word at the end of each sentence."
19551,authority,"the woman, who appears to have more authority than i thought at first, says shrilly, “is this you?” “yes,” i answer."
19552,charged,“you have been charged with numerous offenses.
19553,court,"four, delivering speeches on the grounds and within the buildings, classrooms, and offices of the university, protesting the valid judgments of the revolutionary supreme court in regard to judgments handed down in the cases of accused fellow students."
19554,police,"five, encouraging students at the university to lie down in the streets, thus causing tension between students and the police."
19555,illegal,"six, conducting an illegal and immoral sexual relationship with your fellow accused arash hazrati.” she stops there and looks in the direction of mr."
19556,guilty,maybe “guilty.
19557,guilty,horribly guilty.
19558,guilty,disgustingly guilty.” mr.
19559,guilty,"“miss ghahramani, you have already been found guilty of the charges brought against you."
19560,court,do you accept that you have committed these offenses?” “do you mean that i have been to court already?
19561,trial,"“we are only announcing the result of your trial to you,” says mr."
19562,guilt,“your guilt was well established.” “who were my accusers?
19563,court,“your accusers were the revolutionary court and the public representative.
19564,lawyer,"all legal requirements have been strictly observed.” “did i have a lawyer?”  “oh, yes."
19565,lawyer,you had a very good lawyer.
19566,lawyer,your lawyer was arash hazrati.
19567,lawyer,"you would consider him a good lawyer, wouldn’t you, miss ghahramani?” he looks at me with a little smile, and i notice that the older man has allowed himself to smile, too."
19568,inside,the demon is now back inside my skull.
19569,court,"“fuck you, and fuck your court!” is what i would say if i had the madness and courage of sohrab."
19570,guilty,"the woman with the irritating voice takes her cue and starts chanting the words on her screen once again: “in the name of allah, the accused zarah ghahramani has been found guilty according to evidence recorded during interrogations."
19571,sentence,"the accused will spend thirty days in prison, the days already spent in custody to be deducted from the thirty-day sentence."
19572,state,the accused will repay funds provided by the state for her education.
19573,question,"do you have anything to say in your defense?” i am astonished by the question, but only for a few seconds."
19574,case,they ask me this after telling me that my case has already been decided?
19575,power,"i know they say that power corrupts, but they should tell you that the corruption begins with the powerful losing their embarrassment at being ridiculous."
19576,case,important has closed the folder and looks as if he is ready to move on to some other case.
19577,cell,"i hear the older man say to stinky, “god bless you, hajji, i hope i can compensate you one day.” and stinky replies, “my duty, no more than my duty, hajji.”  back in my cell in evin, all the bitterness and anger that i couldn’t express in the courtroom seethes in my heart and head."
19578,trial,then i begin to think of what was said at the end of the “trial.” i think about the older man saying “i hope i can compensate you one day” to that cretin.
19579,law,"this is the outcome of various bribes and promises and the scratching of backs: gholam, who must be a law unto himself, has generously agreed not to go as far as he might have."
19580,where,"better not take her there.” and, you know, that’s probably where i’ve seen the older guy—at some gathering of big shots that i’ve attended with behnam."
19581,punishment,"iran has a punishment market, so it seems, where the torment of a young woman can be traded for a washing machine."
19582,court,"“i went to court.” “are you going home?” “they said i will, but i don’t believe it."
19583,court,he came to court.” “you deceive yourselves.
19584,evin,"well, evin has done you some good, after all.” i have nothing to say to sohrab for the rest of the day."
19585,torture,"do you know, some of these wicked nations that want the revolution of the iranian people to fail actually torture people?"
19586,torture,"that’s right, torture!"
19587,guard,"i know that the new woman guard is on duty, the one who wants to sleep with me, according to sohrab."
19588,toilet,and she comes to take me to the toilet right away.
19589,toilet,"if i don’t get to the toilet soon, i am going to pee in my pants."
19590,guard,"without warning, the guard pushes the door open and stares down at me."
19591,evin,i am frozen where i stand by the sheer scale of evin.
19592,cell,i can’t even begin to figure out the way back to my own cell.
19593,where,"and so i stand where i am, incapable of moving a muscle."
19594,guard,now i hear the guard approaching me.
19595,toilet,“she pushed me in the toilet and tried to run away.
19596,cell,"i hear my own cell door opening—i know its sound— before i am thrown through the air, landing half on the floor and half against a wall."
19597,where,"the guard kicks me where i lie, aiming for my stomach but not connecting."
19598,guard,"the guard lets me fall, then bends over me and beats me with both fists."
19599,wall,"i can’t manage that for very long and instead struggle to crawl away, until i am jammed against the wall with no further place to escape to."
19600,guard,the guard keeps drawing back his fist and ramming it into whatever part of me he can reach.
19601,cell,"in my writhing, i glimpse the woman guard standing just outside the cell door watching."
19602,guard,"the guard steps away from me, i think to catch his breath."
19603,cell,"the guard takes a big step across the cell and is over me again, punching with renewed energy."
19604,guard,my last image before i faint is of the woman guard at the door.
19605,cell,"then i hear the door to my cell open, and all the difficulty i have had trying to make a loud sound disappears, and i scream."
19606,guard,"the woman guard stands outside the door, just as she was standing before i fainted."
19607,insane,is she insane?
19608,guard,"she has just finished watching the guard beat me black and blue, and now she wants to tell me her life story?"
19609,evin,you can’t pick and choose in evin.
19610,guard,it might be the guard who beat me last night.
19611,punishment,"“you asked for this.” back in my cell, i try to plan ways in which i can kill myself if more punishment comes along."
19612,wall,"there is no way, unless i could bash my head against the wall hard enough to fracture my skull, but that’s very unlikely."
19613,death,i can’t stab myself to death with a spoon.
19614,evin,"in the cells all over evin, people are kneeling in prayer."
19615,cell,"in the morning, after azan, the cell door opens."
19616,guard,"it’s the woman guard with a male guard, not the one who beat me."
19617,guard,the male guard gets down on his knees and starts punching me as hard as he can.
19618,guard,"“leave her alone, you assholes!” “that’s enough,” says the woman guard."
19619,guard,“let’s go.” the guard stops beating me immediately.
19620,guard,he’s not as motivated as the guard who first beat me.
19621,death,"the dead wouldn’t have to endure pain, or what would be the benefit of death?"
19622,freed,"sohrab calls down to me, “how is the little champion?” he’s making a pun on my name, ghahramani, which means “champion.” it’s a weird thing, but these latest blows to my face have freed my mouth a little."
19623,wall,i push myself up to a sitting position with my back against the wall.
19624,guard,"the woman guard from the south with the burned-away face, whatever she wants to do she can."
19625,wall,"on this third day since the first beating, i find i can sit up against the wall without fainting."
19626,toilet,"on my last two visits to the toilet, i haven’t seen the woman guard."
19627,inside,"i don’t really care what he thought, but the sound of his voice helps me to let go of the bleakness and despair inside me for a short time."
19628,taken,"“that’s something they haven’t taken away from me,” i say to sohrab when i’m ready."
19629,illegal,the filmmaker said that there was a time while he was studying cinema when it was illegal to have a vcr at home and that he had to buy one exactly in the way people buy drugs.
19630,jail,"and so filmmakers like him ended up in jail, and writers, too, and artists, and businessmen, and academics."
19631,jail,"but when they got out of jail, these people persisted."
19632,toilet,"make the movies, write the books.” in the night, i hear sohrab calling for the guard to take him to the toilet."
19633,toilet,"i hear him coming  back from the toilet, laughing and swearing at the guard, calling him an asshole."
19634,abuse,"there are at least two of them beating him, and he shrieks with laughter while they go about it and screams abuse."
19635,freed,"24 i sleep fitfully, knowing that tomorrow is the day i am supposed to be freed."
19636,evin,"they save their smiles for those who have no questions to ask, for those who pass evin and think to themselves, god approves."
19637,guard,"i touch my lips with my fingertips, gently test my eyelids and the swelling below my eyes, move my tongue to see if the stinging is less than it was, reach down and pat my rib cage, flex the muscles in my legs, and judge the protests coming from the purple shapes that show the darker impressions of the guard’s knuckles."
19638,where,"i remain where i am, still expecting something more, something worse, but a count of one hundred passes without the door opening."
19639,wall,"then i stand at the back wall and wait, the blindfold around my forehead, ready to pull it down over my eyes."
19640,guard,a guard hits the door with his fist—the signal to cover my eyes.
19641,guard,the guard opens the door.
19642,guard,"but he may have seen me before, whoever he is, because he says to the guard, “haven’t you been feeding her?” and chuckles."
19643,court,"i am taken down to a car, just as i was six days ago, when i went to court."
19644,charge,"he greets the man who is in charge of me, then i am left in the backseat while the two of them sit in the front."
19645,court,it soon becomes obvious to me that we are not traveling the same route we took to court.
19646,charge,"one of the men in the front seat, the driver, says, “thank god for that!” and the other, the man in charge of me, says, “it’s worse every year."
19647,evin,we could have reached my father’s house in twenty minutes from the gates of evin.
19648,case,"i write a letter in my head to mom and dad, in case this should be the end of me."
19649,charge,"after a long period of no traffic noise and no conversation between the driver and the man in charge, the car starts to slow down."
19650,charge,"the driver says, “here?” and the man in charge grunts."
19651,charge,"the man in charge says, “okay, get out.” i struggle upright, then feel with my foot for the door opening."
19652,where,"i wait where i am, standing completely still."
19653,building,"not a building to be seen, not even a shack."
19654,where,"if i hear a car, i will hide, although where i would hide is difficult to say."
19655,where,"i glimpse a woman in the passenger seat with her hair uncovered: the driver’s trophy-wife or girlfriend, exercising her freedom where there are no basiji or policemen to make a fuss."
19656,where,i know where this is.
19657,inside,"when my head rubbed against the inside of the car door as i was being driven here, scabs were torn away, and trickles of fresh blood have dried on my forehead and cheeks."
19658,inside,"he pulls out a leather pouch, unhurriedly feels inside it, and hands  me a coin."
19659,building,over there in the park.” i look in the direction of his gaze and see a small grassy area and a struggling tree on the opposite side of the road between a half-finished building and a yard where concrete pipes are stored on top of one another.
19660,where,"“my baby, where are you?” he is talking in kurdish, the most natural tongue for him, and his most intimate."
19661,where,"where are you?” “ekbatan, block thirty-one."
19662,pleading,"in the background i can hear my mother pleading again and again, “is it zarah?"
19663,where,"oh, god, is it she?”  “don’t leave where you are,” my father says."
19664,where,"baby, you must not leave where you are.” “i won’t, i won’t!” my mother’s voice is on the line now, but only for a second before my time expires."
