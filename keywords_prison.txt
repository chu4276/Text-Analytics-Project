early in the book, one of the students shares the story of her imprisonment and ﬂogging with the reading group.
it referred to the instruction on the wall of cincinnatus c’s jail: ‘‘a prisoner’s meekness is a prison’s pride.’’ although i am not particularly fond of nabokov, if i were to choose one of his works to talk about, it would most likely be invitation to a beheading rather than lolita.
so i picked another quote from the same novel, rule number six for the prisoners: ‘‘it is desirable that the inmates should not have dreams at all.’’ and, thankfully, i could end with something good that rlt had brought to our attention: the uplifting and liberating power of literature.
one cannot imprison oneself in the kitchen for ever.’’ then she asks amir innocently, ‘‘you, for example, how long are you going to remain a simple civil servant?
112  the good, the missing, and the faceless  flying airplanes into buildings, keeping prisoners of war out of reach of the law, beheading those who might vaguely sympathize with the ‘‘enemy,’’ setting o√ bombs in subway cars, and dragging the largest army of the world halfway across the globe to ﬁght imaginary weapons of mass destruction are signs of big trouble.
if the account of the twelve-yearold girl shot to death as she ran around the prison asking for her mother is true, it will not be the ﬁrst time that ideological conviction overcame humanity (191).
the interpretation given for this is that ‘‘as long as he accepts the sham world the jailers impose upon him, cincinnatus will remain their prisoner and will move within the circles of their creation’’ (76).
alas, the kittens were determined not to leave their prison, although they did not seem to enjoy it much, judging by their incessant meowing.

“has he told you that he was a prisoner in evin during the time of the shah?” i was shocked.
i first thought he’d lost his mind.” so ali had been a prisoner in evin and had been tortured.
during the first few months after the revolution, most evin prisoners were former savak agents, and he had his chance to get even with them.

i told her my name and that i was a prisoner.
“life in prison.” “oh, my god!” she said she couldn’t imagine being in evin for more than a week.

sarah and i started working in a small sewing factory that had begun operating in the prison.
most of the girls never asked me where i went at night, but if someone did, i said i had volunteered to work at the prison hospital.

i guessed he had heard that girls were raped in the prison.
it was probably easier for everyone to pretend my imprisonment had never happened.
he and my parents went to the prison immediately and waited all day but were turned away without any explanation.
then they called again on march 26, and we rushed to the prison.
although he knew that because he had come to the church at the time of my visit from evin, the guards knew about our relationship, and it was only at that moment that he realized that the prison authorities had kept a close eye on him.
they had imprisoned me and tortured me emotionally and physically.
what mattered now was doing the right thing, showing them that although i had been forced to convert, i would marry the man i loved, even if doing so would send me back to prison and put me in serious danger.

instead, it strengthened the prison’s silent horror and made it far bloodier than it had ever been.

and for my own family’s sake, i cannot risk any involvement.” for the next six months, except for once a week when we drove to the prison with a trunk lled with watermelons, canned beans, pineapple, and peaches for abdollah and the other prisoners, maman spent her days making bargains with god and imam reza.
the most extreme conclusion i ever considered was that abdollah had been convicted and sentenced to life in the bleak prison where we had visited him.
i’ll like a buzz cut.” unlike hadi, zain was looking forward to a new beginning, glad to be away from the third graders in mashhad who had teased him when, after seeing abdollah in prison, he showed up at school  sucking on a paci er.
we were all questioning whether abdollah was really “studying abroad.” was he in prison for life?
any good ayatollah, professor, or lmmaker is either dead, in prison, or under house arrest.
delirious with exhaustion, he  noticed that the bars of this cell were cleaner than the ones in the mashhad prison where abdollah had been held.
after the initial bliss of fatherhood, zain felt that he was imprisoned forever.
for every hour of the next two months, we relived the helplessness and horror of abdollah’s arrest and imprisonment at the same age as iman.
iman found himself talking to abdollah, whom he had last seen in a cold cell like the one in which he was now imprisoned.
she’s imprisoning me.
you’re imprisoning me.
i couldn’t see him imprisoned like that.
the prison.
ask me a question.” we burst into laughter—loud enough that the hispanic man next to me who had just been sentenced to three years in prison stopped crying and stared.
i hear prison has ltered water.” zain laughed as he caught my wink.
but he would not have to go to prison.
so completely have your words imprisoned me that i have begun seeing them in your face--glimpsed only once, alas, but enough beauty seen in that moment to last a lifetime.

she was doomed to luxuriate in the most immaculate of prisons.
then the two former prisoners served one another with joy and tenderness until the end of their days.
they live their entire lives of desperation in prison, crushed under the weight of bitter ordeals.…28 in this heartbreaking quote, taj poetically expresses how she would rather be dead than alive and shrouded in black: the lives of persian women consist of two things: the black and the white.
riots, threats, and even arrests and imprisonment often resulted.
nevertheless, azad and her husband were harassed, arrested, and even imprisoned until the magazine was ultimately shut down.
during the 1960s, rafsanjani was imprisoned for organizing anti-shah riots and for his political activities promoting islamic resurgence.
previously affiliated with rafsanjani’s construction party, dr. mohajerani’s official liberal stance of “tolerance and laxity” (tasahol va tasameh) was the basis for a directive that sustained a dynamic women’s press, already set in motion by khatami in his capacity as minister of culture and islamic guidance under rafsanjani.16 avant-garde filmmakers, including tahmineh milani (two women, 1999), rakhshan bani etemad (the may lady, 1997), and samira makhmalbaf (the apple, 1998), along with progressive female journalists at various women’s publications, reflected the growing artistic and social forces challenging iran’s suffocating patriarchal atmosphere.17 new organizations and publications employed a more tolerant rhetoric, asserting the need for a “radical re-thinking of law, policy, and constitution.” the formation of more than six hundred nongovernmental organizations (ngos) contributed to the integration of women from divergent backgrounds,18 and this ambitious undertaking elevated the consciousness of the female population, who began to participate in a variety of reformist groups engaging in gender debate and resolution.19 although these forms of expression began to penetrate iranian society, persistent interventions by the council of guardians and the supreme leader disrupted the progressive platform, which as early as 1998 was threatened with laws forbidding the use of non-sharia standards for advocating women’s rights.20 by april of 2000, such assaults, symbolic of the ongoing political schism, led to the closure of over thirty reformist publications and the arrest and imprisonment of numerous defiant journalists.
endorsement by prominent female writers of a revisionist approach to religious scripture not only aims to diminish clerical authority but “to recapture both the purity and vitality of islam that existed at its inception.”36 at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum are scholars haideh moghissi, hammed shahidian, and sharzad mojab, who assert that islamic feminism is essentially “a compromise with patriarchy.”37 this group believes that a “religion based on hierarchy” is insufficient, particularly in its neglect of broader social issues, including sexuality and personal autonomy.38 for example, shahidian maintains: if feminism is a movement to abolish patriarchy, to protect human beings from being prisoners of fixed identities, to contribute towards a society in which individuals can fashion their lives free from economic, political, social and cultural constraints, then islamic feminism proves considerably inadequate.39 nonetheless, other historians assessing “women’s responses to patriarchy” acknowledge that educated muslim women, along with their secular counterparts and enlightened intellectuals, have been a significant force in constructing many of the early arguments concerning islam, gender, and equality.40 the rise of this new discourse has been instrumental in emphasizing that there is “no inherent or logical link between patriarchy and islamic ideals.”41 over the last two decades, the many voices in the vanguard of iran’s islamic feminist movement have included the following women: ♦  zahra rahnavard: former chancellor of al zahra university; wife of former reformist prime minister and presidential candidate mir hossein mousavi: “getting rid of discrimination and demanding equal rights with men is the number one priority for women in tehran.”42  ♦  dr. jamileh kadivar: professor and founding member of the association of iranian female journalists: “the interpretation of islamic laws and regulations by the members of the council of guardians and some islamic jurists has in practice disqualified women from running for presidential elections.
payam-e hajar (hajar’s message) the weekly payam-e hajar (1980–2000), named after the prophet abraham’s wife and launched by azam taleghani, became a success virtually overnight by adopting a moderate position—denouncing both the “westoxicated” woman and the traditional muslim woman of the official ideology.55 a political prisoner during the reign of mohammad reza pahlavi for her anti-regime activities, and a member of the first revolutionary parliament, taleghani was among the initial wave of disenchanted islamist women who began advocating equal rights by challenging the outdated scriptures.56 as the official journal of the islamic women’s institution (mo‘assesseh-ye eslami-ye zanan-e irani), for which taleghani served as director, payam-e hajar openly contested the premise of many patriarchal laws in iranian society.
in one of her editorials, taleghani argued that while the law recognizes a man’s right to “take up to four wives as long as he is able to treat them all equally, the very fact that the infallible prophet muhammad was in principle unable to perform this task would make it highly inconceivable for the ordinary man to do so either.”57 in 2000, payam-e hajar was officially shut down for unspecified reasons.58  farzaneh (wise) farzaneh (1993–2009), a prominent, independent academic journal of women’s studies published in both english and farsi by the center for women’s studies and research, served predominantly as a theological and theoretical campaigning medium among academics, scholars, and policymakers in iran and abroad.59 its licensee, massoumeh ebtekar, served in khatami’s administration, and its editor in chief, mahboubeh abbasgholizadeh, was a well-known women’s rights activist, whose numerous public demonstrations culminated in her arrest and imprisonment in 2010.60 farzaneh’s exceedingly unbiased viewpoint may best be exemplified in the philosophy of abbasgholizadeh: we know that secular women do not share our convictions, but this does not give us any problems, since we are all working to promote the status of women.
in 2012, she was sentenced to six months in prison for “making propaganda against the ruling system” and prohibited from participating in all cultural, political, and media activities for a period of five years.73 throughout all of her trials and tribulations, hashemi has always maintained that “it is not islam which forbids women from attaining office, but the interpretation of its teachings by the clerics.”74 zanan (women) known for its modern perspective on gender issues related to religion, law, culture, and education, zanan (1992–2008) was launched in february 1992.
after all, the supreme leader doesn’t come from god!42 in 1999, kadivar was tried and sentenced to eighteen months in prison for challenging the doctrine of clerical rule.
one example is the story of some fanatics in iran who have tried to prevent women from biking, which is in the same tradition as that of the taliban’s prevention of women from riding horses.57 as a consequence, saidzadeh was excommunicated, imprisoned, and forbidden to publish.58 nevertheless, saidzadeh continues to maintain the validity of feminism in iran as a viable “social movement,” which, through emphasizing the common humanity of the sexes, endeavors to free women “from an unwanted subordination imposed by [an] androcentric society.”59  discord between feminist allies mehrangiz kar remained with zanan until her arrest in april 2000, after she and sixteen other reformist women, including shahla sherkat, attended the berlin conference on “the future of reform in iran.”60 in the aftermath of this meeting, the groundbreaking reconciliation between secular and religious women was momentarily brought to a halt when kar was sentenced behind closed doors to four years’ imprisonment for her criticism of the islamic constitution, while sherkat was tried, fined, and released in an open court for questioning the religious dress code.61 kar was bitterly dismayed at sherkat for not coming to her defense and for choosing to protect her magazine over her relationship: we always sensed that there was a gap.
it simply became clear after berlin that the reformists would never take any risks for us, or defend us.…62 kar was diagnosed with cancer after spending two months in prison.
under pressure from the european union, khatami officials intervened, allowing her to leave for treatment in the u.s.63 over the years the rift between the two women has been attributed to kar’s secularism  versus sherkat’s religious identity, and there has been a range of speculation including sherkat’s alleged fear of “possible retaliation by the system, loss of employment and imprisonment.”64 although such conclusions are entirely plausible, the decisive issue for sherkat may have been neither one of those considerations.
during her many trips to iran, sciolino, a correspondent for newsweek and the new york times, often contemplated this unusual fact: “sometimes i could not figure out why zanan had not been shut down.”70 in her extensive documentation of women in the muslim world, ida lichter considers the same question: “it is remarkable that zanan has survived for sixteen years in a country that reporters without borders has called the biggest prison for journalists in the middle east.”71 in april 1997, khatami acknowledged in an interview with sherkat that “the culture of patriarchy is one of the most important impediments to women in iran, and … the laws pertaining to gender equality will benefit civil society.”72 mir-hosseini observes that, although khatami’s pledge for freedom was not entirely fulfilled, “reformist efforts to reconcile islam, democracy and human rights brought to the surface many of the inherent contradictions between the constitution and gender rights in sharia law and democratic ideals.”73 in many ways, sherkat’s role as a “persistent trespasser” has been indisputable in this regard.74 while khatami was unable to prevent the closure of numerous reformist publications, he may have traveled the extra mile for zanan.
the previous disconnect between iranian women has transformed into a collective movement which will not be silenced.1 delaram ali, twenty-four-year-old sociology student arrested and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for her participation in the haft-e tir square protests in 2006 the only way the women’s movement, as a new social movement in iran, can move their rights forward is through a change in the laws … women citizens have the right to object to discriminatory legislation.
women do not have the right to walk on the beach.”19 baniyaghoub’s 2007 and 2009 coverage of gender-related protests in iran led to her imprisonment and thirty-year ban from journalistic activities.
she believes “security forces have become more and more aggressive, even as women’s actions have become more peaceful over time.”20 nonetheless, baniyaghoub ended a letter to her husband, written from prison, on an optimistic note: we are 33 women with a variety of opinions and at times opposing points of views at evin’s women’s ward.
some prisoners are supporters of the green movement, others are baha’i, born again christians or members of the mojahedin khalgh.
my dearest bahman, what i find most attractive about this prison is that individuals with a variety of backgrounds and opposing points of view are coexisting peacefully.
the detentions come as iran’s hardliners struggle to keep tabs on a growing population that wants greater freedom of speech, a right rouhani promised he would fight for when he was elected.31  paying a price for pursuing freedom the likelihood of being arrested and serving time in prison has not been a deterrent for many reformist women.
many who have been imprisoned remain committed to the struggle within iran once they are freed; some leave the country in order to advocate for change from abroad.
their resolve remains strong even though some 4,000 students, women’s rights activists, and journalists continue to be detained in iranian prisons.32 among those paying a high price for speaking out in favor of women’s rights: ♦  ♦ ♦  ♦  ♦  ♦  in 2006, noushin ahmadi khorasani and parvin ardalan were part of a large contingent of peaceful protestors at haft-e tir square who were arrested, tried, and sentenced on various fraudulent charges.33 in 2007, parvin ardalan was awarded the olof palme prize for courage in stockholm, sweden, and although she was banned from leaving the country to accept the honor in person, the recognition itself was sufficient validation.
she was charged with the intent of “endangering national security” and “propaganda against the state.” as with many of her predecessors, when ardalan eventually fell prey to the iranian authorities, it did not go unnoticed among western nations.34 in 2011, maryam majd, twenty-five, one of only a handful of iran’s female sports photographers, and filmmaker mahnaz mohammadi, thirty-seven, were arrested for “unspecified reasons.” mohammadi understood her detention in this way: “i am both a woman and a filmmaker—sufficient to be arrested.”35 controversial screenwriter tahmineh milani, fifty-one, who has endured numerous arrests for her fearless onscreen portrayals since her career began in 1989, is adamant “that a society which reduces women to mere sexual objects would have a high price to pay.”36 faezeh rafsanjani, journalist, founder of the magazine zan (woman), women’s rights activist, former member of iranian parliament, and daughter of former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, recently served a six-month prison sentence for her relentless criticism of the regime’s discriminatory practices.
therefore, when i do not believe in that custom and i do not believe them to be logical or i do not value them to be beneficial to society, especially to girls and women, i do not see it necessary to follow them.37  ♦  jila baniyaghoub, the award-winning freelance journalist mentioned earlier, served a one-year prison sentence and wrote about her experiences in her book, women of evin: ward 209.

a french colonial court sentenced her to death and she was tortured in prison.
prisons began to swell with islamists, activists and militants who, disenchanted with the old failed ideologies, turned to religion to inflect their opposition.

in the words of one scholar, awlaki’s “radicalization is consistent with the historical pattern of activists adopting a belief in terrorism when political action fails to bring about change.” it also fit the pattern of islamist or muslim activists emerging from prison, where they endured intensive torture, with a radically altered position on the use of violence against civilians.
the thousands of muslims who had watched him online did not know what befell sheikh anwar in a yemeni prison cell.

in invitation to a beheading, on the wall of cincinnatus c.'s jail, which is decorated like a thirdrate hotel, there are certain instructions for the prisoners, such as: "a prisoner's meekness is a prison's pride."
rule number six, one that lies at the heart of the novel, is: "it is desirable that the inmate should not have dreams at all, or if he does, should immediately himself suppress nocturnal dreams whose context might be incompatible with the condition and status of the prisoner, such as: resplendent landscapes, outings with friends, family dinners, as well as sexual intercourse with persons who in real life and in the waking state would not suffer said individual to come near, which individual will therefore be considered by the law to be guilty of rape."
our focus in each is on the delicate spot where the prisoner touches the bar, on the invisible contact between flesh and cold metal.
as long as he accepts the sham world the jailers impose upon him, cincinnatus will remain their prisoner and will move within the circles of their creation.

of course, she knows—has always known—that in her own time and her own city, prisons also exist.
she remembers helping parviz with his history lesson on the storming of the bastille, telling him about the mob that invaded the hôtel des invalides for ammunition and gathered outside the prison, about the fighting that erupted, and about the governor of paris, a certain marquis de launey, who, finding himself impotent in the face of such fury, had opened the gates, and consequently led the way to his own death: only hours later his decapitated head was paraded down the streets on a pike.

prisoners, who have little to distract them, have no choice but to stare at this wallpaper.

my father never smiled in public because a prison guard had knocked out his teeth.

today isaac sits by the prison mosque with mehdi and ramin and a few other men he has met since his arrival, some six weeks ago: hamid, a low-ranking general from the shah’s army; reza, a young revolutionary who was involved in the capture of the american hostages but ended up in jail, presumably for helping his father, a minister of the shah, escape the country; and old man muhammad, whom no one knows much about, except that he has three daughters in the women’s block—one for being a communist, one for being an adulteress, and the third for being their sister.

the rivals spin, and when the music finally stops the one sitting down is elaheh, the daughter of the head of a prison.
“yes, fine.” he is sitting outside with the usual group of prisoners, which now includes vartan, the pianist, who is not a talkative man, at least not here.

their names appear in the paper’s list of executed, and by the time isaac and the other prisoners are taken outside for their weekly dose of air, in the early afternoon, the news has spread among the men like the warning of cholera in a damp city.

your names have been called.” ramin opens his eyes then shuts them again, until a guard comes, grabs isaac by his shirt collar and the boy by his ear, and drags the two into the hallway, where other prisoners are also gathered, among them the pianist.

thanks also to the photographer abbas, whose powerful images of iran offered me great inspiration, to simin habibian for her book, 1001 persian-english proverbs, and to the many political prisoners whose candid accounts provided me with the painful details of imprisonment and torture: specifically, i am indebted to hassan darvish, monireh baradaran, and my own dear father, simon sofer.

this was always the most painful part of my work: the searching eyes of the mothers and fathers whose children had been killed or were imprisoned, seeing in me some potential help.
i had witnessed this over the years with many of my clients, dissidents and activists whose relatives suffered state intimidation, were hassled and threatened and sometimes blackmailed or imprisoned, all “collateral damage” in the quest to get the original target—the dissident or activist or journalist in question—to drop their activities.

however, emami was conveniently found dead in the shower of his prison block, allegedly having committed suicide by swallowing a bottle of hair remover, in effect shutting down the “investigation.” khatami’s political party and its allies went on to win a majority in the 2000 parliamentary elections, and many prominent conservative candidates were soundly defeated.
several prominent newspaper editors and journalists were tried and sentenced to multiyear prison terms, on charges of “undermining state security,” “insulting islam,” and “confusing” public opinion.

they had many documents, hajj agha said, proving my complicity in plans to overthrow the regime—documents so confidential, they could not show them to me outside of prison.
in any case, hajj agha showed up in evin prison a few days after the publication of the article and said to me: “such things are over and done with.” a compelling but mad logic outside prison, ja’fari’s and hajj agha’s repeated references to “the triangle,” “plots,” and “conspiracies” seemed outlandish, even amusing.
but in the isolation of prison and the interrogation room, i had to fight hard to avoid hajj agha’s conspiratorial mind-set.
in july 2000, ten iranian jews from shiraz were tried behind closed doors on trumped-up charges of espionage and sentenced to long prison terms, despite an international outcry, the direct intervention of the european union,  and a promise to european ambassadors that the trial would be public and they could attend.

the prospect of months and years in prison were unbearable to me.
evin prison  for the nearly four months of my solitary confinement in evin, my only human contacts were the guards, the interrogators, and the occasional prison doctor.
i learned to tell the time of day by the early-morning chirping of the birds, the changing of the guards, mealtimes, and the daily tempo of prison life.
ward 209 was reserved for political prisoners and run by the intelligence ministry.
on the women’s block, doors led in succession to the small rooftop terrace, the inmates’ bathroom, the separate guards’ bathroom, and a row of five or six prisoners’ cells.
during my 105 days at the prison, i managed to avoid looking at either of the men.
the harsh world they created and ran had turned on me and made me a prisoner.
i never saw the other prisoners in the women’s block, but i could hear them—knocking on their cell doors to go to the bathroom, sometimes exchanging angry words with the guards.
i could tell when a new prisoner was brought in because the cover over the small opening in my cell door would be pulled shut.
when i was in the corridor myself, a door left wide open to reveal an empty cell meant a prisoner had been released or transferred elsewhere.
prison days from the first day, i decided that if i were to avoid succumbing to despair, i had to impose a strict discipline on myself.
i avoided thinking about my husband, daughter, and grandchildren or about home—knowing the pain of missing them could cripple my ability to withstand the pressures of prison.
counting repetitions helped me avoid brooding over the long imprisonment that stretched before me.
nothing in my previous experience had prepared me for evin, but knew i had to avoid the listlessness that overtakes prisoners and to stave off depression, which lurked like a dark shadow in every corner of my cell.
in the second week of my incarceration, one of the guards began to bring me books from the prison library, mostly on shi’ism.
i was bemused by the thought that the left-wing author of zorba the greek had fans in evin prison.
there were two faucets and a clothesline on the terrace and detergent was available from the prison guards.
a fresh change of clothes was important to me as yet another small way to stave off the indignities and dehumanizing effects of prison and remain the same haleh.
a member of the prison staff would telephone and specify, by name, whose turn it was to be out.
i had been shocked to discover in my prison reading how harsh the quran is toward the jews who were living in arabia at the time of the prophet and who did not accept mohammad’s new dispensation.

conscious of her looks, she chose her non-prison clothes with care and consulted me on the color of clothes she should buy.
she took her showers and washed her underclothes in prison.
as prison guards, they were government employees.
prison cuisine unlike the rest of evin prison, where, according to twiggy, the food was disgusting, the inmates of ward 209 ate relatively well, since they were served the same food as the intelligence ministry’s staff.
for breakfast, each prisoner was given tea and a loaf of bread with cream cheese.
i had never had the most robust appetite, but meals at the prison made me especially uncomfortable.
once i learned i could have food purchased for me outside prison, i was in control of what i was eating.
the doctors every two weeks, inmates in ward 209 paid a visit to the prison doctor.
i was taken to the prison doctor on my first morning at evin.
my refusal grated on the prison doctor and he repeatedly brought up the issue.
never a big eater, and with the crushing anxieties of prison taking their toll, i had been losing weight at an alarming rate and had managed to convey this to my mother, who passed the information on to hayedeh and shaul.
perhaps they wanted to teach me a lesson, or perhaps the prison doctors wanted to avoid responsibility if my condition further deteriorated.
no iranian political prisoner  had received sustained press coverage.
these were available to prisoners under fewer restrictions than i. i was instructed to be brief, to limit myself to pleasantries, and to speak to mutti only in persian, never in german.
in prison i often dreamed of the dead, perhaps because i had tried so hard to push the present—home, family, friends, the prison—from my mind.
it means you will get out of prison soon.” there were a number of times when i tried to convey to mutti more important messages.
shaul said: “if they take you to prison, i will unleash a tsunami in the press the likes of which they have never seen.” several weeks into my incarceration, fearing i had been forgotten by the outside world, i remembered that conversation and wanted in some way to convey to shaul that the time for the tsunami had come, that he must get the media to focus on my plight immediately.
in any case, ja’fari had told me to tell my mother to stop coming to the prison gate with fruit, medication, and clothing.
in past years, i recalled, imprisoned journalists akbar ganji and emadeddin baghi had been allowed weekends home.
(in the bizarre ways of the islamic republic, mohseni-eje’i, the infamous judge who had presided over karbaschi’s trial and had unjustly sentenced him to a long prison term, attended the wedding, too.)

this was my prison, a hellhole.
in a country where satellite dishes are officially banned (although every home has a concealed or a shockingly not-so-concealed satellite dish), one can’t expect cnn in prison.
my eyesight had grown worse in prison, without my usual medication, and i woke up each morning with excruciating pain.
we walked out the same door through which i had entered the prison building three months earlier.
all the other female prisoners in ward 209 had left, and the ward was virtually empty.
i understood the gravity of my decision, but the thought of spending years in prison was unbearable to me.
we waited for a group of male prisoners to pass.
beneath my blindfold i could make out a line of men in standard prison jumpsuits, blindfolded like me, shuffling past, each man holding on to the shirt of the man in front.
matin-rassekh might renew my detention order for another four months or, at best, issue an order transferring me from ward 209 to the general ward for women prisoners.
i would be out of the clutches of the intelligence ministry but, oddly enough, i did not welcome the prospect of becoming an “ordinary” prisoner or being lost in the general prison population.
“will i get to see you outside prison?” i asked.
he repeated the words he had used during my first week in prison: “sharmandeh.” to my shame.
for four months, i had prayed for this moment, and i could not leave ward 209, evin prison—and iran—fast enough.
i wanted nothing that belonged to the prison to touch my body again.
i set aside only a couple of t-shirts and pants that i had never worn in prison and a few personal items to take home with me.
i also had to fill out a questionnaire regarding prison conditions: the cell, the food, the medical attention, the general hygiene, and how i had been treated.
i gave the prison guards a glowing evaluation, then i embraced each guard in turn, even sour face.
as we moved toward the exit, i saw a group of incoming prisoners: they stood blindfolded and facing the wall, anxious and disoriented—grown men and women reduced, like children, to helplessness.
we stepped out into the hot sun of the prison courtyard.
inside, a crowd of prisoners were waiting to be discharged.
the hulking prison, with its gray walls and barbed wire, its cells and interrogation rooms, which had been my prison and my home for 105 days, was now behind me.
the reporter persisted: how did the prison authorities treat me?
i told the reporter i had dealt only with the prison guards, and they were helpful and courteous.

he snapped, “that is not very long.” she asked when i would be set free; he replied, “whenever her work is finished” and when she pointed that out they had held me in prison for more than three months already, he replied, “hamineh ke hast,” a rude expression in persian that means, that is the way it is.
i told each of them how elated i was to be out of evin prison, but that i didn’t know if and when i could leave for home.
for some inexplicable reason, he insisted on delivering the medicine prescribed by the prison doctors, which i had never used at evin.
in prison, i was unaware of any of this.
as it happened, i was arrested early on the morning of may 8, and by the time shaul and the wilson center people met, i was already in evin prison.
the story of a sixty-seven-year-old grandmother held in solitary confinement in a notorious prison simply for having organized conferences on iranian and middle eastern issues was in itself compelling.
matin-rassekh refused to allow shirin to meet with me in evin prison, refused to allow her to see the file on my case, and refused even to specify the charges against me.
in prison, i had dismissed the remark of national security adviser larijani that “we don’t want to keep her” as mere talk.
professors juan cole from the university of michigan and chibli mallat from saint-joseph university in beirut and the university of utah turned down invitations to go to conferences in iran as long as i was in prison.
particularly hurtful was a new york times op-ed by an older, former student of mine published while i was still in evin prison.
under the title of “prisoner of her desires,” the author, an advocate of punitive sanctions and military threats against iran, used my arrest as a prop to argue his own case, suggesting that i had received my just deserts for having naively advocated dialogue with the iranians.
freedom  in the days after my release, i gloried in my freedom and took pleasure in small things: sleeping in a clean bed with ironed sheets, being able to turn off a bedside lamp and sleep in soothing darkness, looking into a mirror again, wearing my own slippers instead of plastic prison slippers.
only four days ago, i was forcing myself to eat bread and cheese, sitting alone at a child’s desk in a prison cell.
barely five feet tall, compactly built, she stood with her feet planted firmly on the ground, as if to say, “here i stand; you’re going to have to deal with me.” she had used her nobel prize money to set up the center for the defense of human rights, and along with two other lawyers who also worked pro bono, she represented political prisoners like me.
as we paced on the sidewalk, since we both knew her office was bugged, she queried me about the conditions of my incarceration, my prison cell, methods of interrogation, questions i had been asked, papers i had signed, how matin-rassekh had dealt with me—all the details important for a human-rights lawyer.
one last interview on the tuesday afternoon that hajj agha showed up at evin prison to tell me i was free to go, he “requested” that i do one more interview that they could film.

farah was lucky to find a temporary shelter at a good friend’s house with a gorgeous garden, close to the dreaded evin prison, where her husband and his comrades were kept.
the garden was close enough to the prison compound that she could hear, at dawn, the loudspeakers sounding out the call to morning prayer.
“every morning at dawn i walked to the wall at the bottom of the garden to listen to the chants of the prisoners.
i refused to think that [he] would probably not be among those prisoners.”  13 during her last years, but especially that final year, a circle formed around farah, consisting of her family and friends.

cady stanton begins her essay by championing “the individuality of each human soul” and goes on to elaborate why every woman must live “in a world of her own, the arbiter of her own destiny, an imaginary robinson crusoe with her woman friday on a solitary island.”  in words that are more poetic and anguished than ideological and polemical, she writes, “the isolation of every human soul and the necessity of self-dependence must give each individual the right to choose his own surroundings.” then she relates how she once asked prince kropotkin, a russian political prisoner, “how he endured his long years in prison, deprived of books, pen, ink, and paper.” he responded, “in the pursuit of an idea i took no note of time.

prisoners have to be offered bail before they can be transferred to evin, so the court had to go through the motions, even though we couldn’t possibly arrange for that large of a payment on such short notice.
after being taken to the police station to get some forms, we were shocked to discover we were headed to evin prison.
it was hard to believe that we were about to enter one of the world’s most notorious prisons, imprisoned only for our faith in god.
elena and shirin waited at the prison entrance to say good-bye and wish us well.
then we walked through the tall, imposing entrance gate with “evin prison” written across the top, out of the spring sunshine and into another world.
chapter 7 evin, our church maryam the entrance to evin prison was on a hill.
the woman led us past a beautiful green courtyard with flowers and trees that was evidently used by the staff as a break area; it looked more like a park than a prison.
we were now officially prisoners of the islamic republic of iran.
a guard led us out a back door into the main prison yard, which was huge and covered with so many red brick buildings it looked like a town.
after a ten-minute walk, we arrived at the women’s prison block.
though the women who searched us looked and acted like guards, they were actually prisoners.
as we soon learned, the inmates did most of the work inside evin, which made life easier for the guards and staff and gave certain prisoners the chance to earn special favors.
after we dressed, we were led up a long flight of stairs to an office outside the cell block, where women prisoners were coming and going.
she was the prisoner in charge of ward 2, keeping order among the inmates and acting as a point of contact between prisoners and prison staff.
ward 3 was for prisoners with mental problems—and as the newest and cleanest part of the women’s prison, was  usually the only part shown to visiting inspectors or other outsiders.
under the lowest bunk in each set were three or four wicker baskets, one for each person in the room, the only personal storage space the prisoners had.
still others were coming and going to “the shop,” a tiny window down the hall where prisoners bought supplies, snacks, and little luxuries from the prison commissary.
newcomers always cry for an hour before they settle down.” another woman shouted back, “political prisoners don’t cry, because we haven’t done anything wrong!” “don’t worry,” the woman who had mentioned crying said, “we’re all political prisoners in this room.” she introduced herself as tahereh.
they were arrested at the airport and brought to prison.
we hadn’t received them yet, so we’d have to make do with whatever the prison gave us until the holidays were over, along with any help our fellow inmates might offer.
a loudspeaker crackled with the names of several prisoners, who jumped up to report to the office.
every inmate both loved and dreaded hearing her name called—loved it because of the hope that she would be released from evin prison, dreaded it because the news could also be devastating.
everybody who comes into this prison says, ‘i’ve done nothing wrong.’ if they’d done nothing wrong, they wouldn’t be here.” this woman seemed extremely upset and angry, and i soon found out why.
mr. sedaghat was the prison warden.
when another man claimed the property was legally his, this woman was charged with trying to sell something she didn’t own and sent to prison.
we said we were in prison for believing in jesus christ.
“how can they put somebody in prison because of their faith?” without going into too much detail, i said we were accused of activities against the regime.
so that night, instead of celebrating with my friend, i was brought here to evin prison.” she went through intense interrogation the first few days and was kept in solitary confinement.
“most people have to sleep on the floor for the first week or so.” after sleeping on the floor at vozara for the past fourteen days, even a thin and dirty mattress in evin prison felt like a cloud.
established prisoners received more minutes than new arrivals, and those with longer sentences got more time than the rest.
prisoners could sell their time to other inmates, usually for snacks from the commissary.
later that morning, we had a long talk with sanaz, the woman imprisoned for her brother’s bad check.
it’s hard to celebrate when a prison wall separates you from the people you love.
will you pray for me, too?” evin prison, the dreaded hellhole of tehran and symbol of radical islamic oppression, had become our church.
mommy told us the woman’s name was soraya and that she had been in prison for eight years on fraud charges.
i couldn’t believe the sight of this child in a dirty, overcrowded prison.
mrs. mahjoob explained that room 4 of ward 2 was for prisoners who were mothers of young children.
maryam and i went with mrs. mahjoob to room 4 to meet the boy’s mother, a very tall, slender afghan woman, imprisoned on drug charges.
children could live in the prison only until they were three years old; after that, they were separated from their mothers by the authorities and sent to an orphanage if no other family members were available.
she stabbed him to death in self-defense and was sentenced to life in prison for murder.
she had been born in prison.
kasra was the pet of the women’s prison warden, mrs. rezaei, and was the only child she showed any affection.
kasra’s mother was a beautiful, aggressive lesbian, whose young lover, vida, was known as “the jail child” because she had been born in prison and had lived most of her life there.
the situation at evin prison was as bad or worse—taunting words, suggestive movements, and open expressions of physical love were so common that they were taken for granted.
they had been in prison for two years on drug charges and lived downstairs.
during the holidays, maryam and i went downstairs to exercise in the little courtyard, where we mixed with the ward 2 prisoners from the lower floor.
one lone tree added a touch of life and greenery to the scene, but during our stay in evin the guards made one of the prisoners cut it down.
“my friend and i are in prison for our belief in jesus.
samaneh and sima, both in prison on murder charges, were the most notorious couple at evin.
who would have ever thought i would be standing beside her in prison?
sima denied the charges and was still fighting them after eight years in prison.
during that time, her celebrity and personality had made her the most powerful inmate—the boss of bosses—in the women’s prison at evin.
the years had also turned her into someone who would do anything to satisfy herself and stay on favorable terms with the prison officials.
other prisoners hated her because she treated them so scornfully and because she turned them in for rules violations in order to enhance her position with the staff.
when she was in charge of frisking prisoners for drugs, some inmates said she took the job to extremes, putting her finger inside their bodies or making them relieve themselves in front of her to ensure there were no drugs hidden in the most private of places.
it was very sad to see how life in prison had made her willing to do anything to survive, even sending other women to their death.
for every hard-hearted prisoner like sima, there were many who were kind and friendly to us.
rozita had been in prison for three months.
her brother was a prisoner at evin and had survived intensive interrogations in ward 209.
another prisoner in ward 209 with them was shirin alam hooli, a member of the kurdish opposition group known as pjak.
they took shirin to ward 240, where political prisoners arrested by the guard go for special interrogation.
she had since learned farsi in prison.
the food in evin prison was awful.
once a week we had sausage, which was horrible and gave many of the prisoners diarrhea every time they ate it.
twice a week, the prison cooks baked what looked like whole wheat bread.
that was before we discovered that the prison bread routinely contained flies, hair, pieces of plastic, and an occasional tooth.
though we were hungry from eating only one meal six days a week, we avoided most of the sickness that the prison food caused so frequently.
and we soon learned that the medical care in evin prison was every bit as bad as the cooking.
within a few days of our arrival at the prison, marziyeh got sick after showering in the icy cold water.
when i told mrs. mahjoob, the prisoner in charge of ward 2, that marziyeh needed to see a doctor, she said he was on vacation for nowruz and wouldn’t be back until after the holidays.
marziyeh stayed in bed for nearly a week, miserable, shivering, and exhausted, relieved only by the tea or fruit juice other prisoners brought her once in a while and a few bootleg painkillers.
the springs on all the beds were completely shot, so most prisoners used two of their three blankets as a mattress pad and the third to sleep under.
but if she gave up her bed, another prisoner would immediately claim it and it could be weeks before she had a bed again.
i pressed the prison office for medical care, as did some other prisoners who were sick, but the answer was always the same: “the doctor is gone for the holidays.
the political prisoners were always the quietest, calmest, most polite members of the ward.
the courts were still closed for new year’s, which meant that few prisoners entered or left evin.
she had been in prison several times and considered it helpful to her research into the treatment of women by the regime and also as a way to meet other activists.
mrs. azam had been in prison for nearly three years on charges of acting against national security by joining a rally in support of women’s rights.
a prisoner named emma was in charge of scheduling telephone slots.
when we asked for telephone time, we learned that other prisoners had been using our time and didn’t want to turn it over to us.
the call time allotment was something the prisoners worked out on their own; the prison didn’t officially hand out telephone minutes.
“you stupid political prisoners!” she hollered.
we had worked hard to get along with the other prisoners, even when it meant giving up little privileges such as a good place in line at the shop window or a bigger serving of potatoes and eggs, the one meal a week we would eat.
she had been in prison for eight years on fraud charges and would not be released until she repaid her creditors.
her debt was so large that she could never repay it from prison, which meant she would likely be locked up for the rest of her life.
i can’t stand this!” marjan said she’d been in prison for two years because a former friend stole a pre-signed check from her office, made it out to herself for a large amount, and cashed it.
when the check bounced, the friend sued marjan and had her sent to prison.
she had been in prison for eight months on murder charges, even though her husband had committed the crime.
if they were convicted together, they would get life in prison.
“i learned i was pregnant in prison,” she said.
how on earth can i spend the rest of my life in prison with my child?” she left in tears, headed back inside with the rest of the “murderers.” when the baby was born, pouneh would be transferred upstairs with the other mothers.
another prisoner, mana, was only twenty-three, but it was hard to tell because she wore so much makeup that she looked like a clown.
though wearing makeup was against prison rules, mana and some other prisoners wore it at night after dinner when the guards seldom came around.
you assume god has abandoned you for burning the koran, when in fact it is you who are cursing yourself and abandoning him.” mana explained that she and her husband had been in prison for three years for stealing money from the government.
our fellow prisoners were hungry for the truth.
on the surface, the prison environment seemed to be a dead end.
and because we were already in prison for promoting christianity, we figured we might as well shout the good news of jesus christ from the rafters.
mrs. mahjoob said that some prisoner who was gone must have forgotten about it and left it, and i should just throw it away.
even trash might have some value in prison.
“now you can read a portion of the authentic bible you’ve always wanted.” as word got around, many, many prisoners wanted to read it.
before long, dozens of women had their first look at the true christian scriptures, reading the little volume signed by one of the most powerful men in the church, who had died more than twenty years before and whose little pocket gospel had miraculously turned up under a bed in a women’s prison in the middle of islamic iran.
to look at the sky from behind the high walls of a prison is like a stone weight on the heart.
chapter 10 a nasty reputation maryam on the thirteenth and final day of nowruz, known as sizdah bedar, the prisoners were allowed to spend the whole day outside, visiting, dancing, drinking tea, and savoring the final hours before the normal prison routine resumed.
there were prisoners who danced beautifully with graceful, artistic moves, while others pulsed and gyrated to the pounding beat of hip-hop music.
register time!” this was the mandatory headcount of all prisoners taken every morning and again at 7:00 p.m. every night.
some prejudiced guards forced prisoners to pray omalyajib islamic prayers.
at last, one of the guards and mrs. alipour, a prisoner who worked downstairs, came out to do the job.
the end of nowruz also meant that the prison shop would reopen.
the canned tuna and chicken were awful, supplied at inflated prices by one of the mafia-like gangs that control much of the prison system.
there were no dairy products or anything fresh, so there was little relief from the nasty prison food.
we bought a supply of chocolate and the best snacks to give away to the poorest prisoners who couldn’t buy anything.
we also gave a lot of items to the children, who, if they weren’t nursing, had nothing to eat but the disgusting prison food.
many of the prisoners in our ward went back to bed for a couple of hours after roll call, then had their breakfast and went to the cultural center.
the prison authorities portrayed the cultural center to the outside world as one of their strong points: a place where inmates got healthy exercise, expressed themselves artistically, and were instructed in the muslim faith.
marziyeh, who is a good table tennis player, started a game with another prisoner.
“aren’t all prisoners allowed to use the cultural center, regardless of their charges?” i asked.
there are no secrets in prison.
the daughter had told her that our presence in prison was god’s message to her that she should convert.
the most important topics were always prison conditions and the status of various inmates.
no visitors had been allowed at evin prison during the holidays.
by law, each prisoner was allowed a noncontact visit every week, and one contact visit per month, when we could hug and touch our visitors.
in practice, the head of the women’s prison, mrs. rezaei, and the prison staff reserved contact visits for their friends, and in exchange for bribes from other inmates.
we waited an hour for the small, dirty minibus that took us across the prison complex to the visitors’ building.
because we were outside, we had to wear chadors and dirty prison slippers that were far too big.
family members were already seated, so prisoners rushed in like a herd of buffalo to find their visitors as quickly as possible because we only had ten minutes.
we did our best to act happy, avoiding stories of what life in prison was really like.
he had been to evin prison twice already to have us sign the form, but was not allowed to see us.
after our visit, we talked with two friends who worked in the prison advisory services office about getting permission to see our lawyer.
in most political cases, and in a few rare unusual cases like yours, our office isn’t allowed to help the prisoner.” it was a fresh reminder that what happened to us was in god’s hands alone.
the three of us formed what we called “our community.” each day, we spent the morning together praying for the inmates, for ourselves, and for a renewed vision of how to serve god better while we were in prison.
it is impossible to put into words the feeling of taking communion secretly together inside an iranian prison.
it encouraged prisoners who had been hesitant to reach out to us before to make contact.
i’m in prison because my husband and i owe my brother money.
a friend of mine in prison told me about you and said i should ask you to pray for me.” her friend was ziba, a woman we knew who lived downstairs because she’d been arrested on prostitution charges, but who worked upstairs on our floor during the day.
she had now been in prison for three months and had no way to raise bail.
soon after easter, mrs. imani, the woman who seemed so crazy and was always desperate to use the telephone, gave us new evidence of what many prisoners really thought about islam.
as soon as i get out of prison, i’m going to the ukraine and going to church.” for all her newfound passion for christ, she didn’t change her outward habits.
it was clear that inmates who seemed to be fanatical believers—praying, reading the koran, and fingering their beads for hours on end—did so not necessarily because they believed any of it, but to gain favor with the prison officials.
that kind of religious charade doesn’t happen only inside evin prison.
many of the prisoners went through the motions of islam because they felt they had no choice.
more important, the prisoners felt his power too.
chapter 11 willing spirit, weary flesh marziyeh there was a prisoner downstairs named mercedeh, a rough-looking character whose arms were covered with knife scars.
can you tell me something about yourself?” as mercedeh was telling me that she had been in prison a year and a half for armed robbery, another woman walked up behind her and interrupted, shouting, “who are you talking to?” she leaned toward the window and said sharply to me, “who has allowed you to talk to this girl?” then she pulled mercedeh away from the window and slammed the shutters closed.
“i hadn’t seen her in years until i ran into her in prison.
she had said no and would stay in prison as long as she refused.
she said her teeth had been knocked out by her interrogators when she first came to prison.
after mercedeh was captured, the prison guards had tortured her to reveal the names of her robbery victims.
the filth, bad food, poor medical care, and lack of exercise and fresh air in prison made it practically impossible to stay healthy.
prisoners saw their hair become thin and brittle from malnutrition, like shirin alam hooli’s had done; their skin, eyesight, strength, and ability to sleep were all degraded by the conditions.
several times, i visited the clinic, in another building across the prison yard from the women’s prison.
they could get their fix more easily inside the prison, because the prison officials readily sold drugs supplied by the same organized crime group that controlled sales at the prison shop.
in the dream, my right hand had a hole in it from the nail, and i heard jesus say to me, “i have let you taste a little of my suffering.” when i awoke, i thanked god for the strength to survive in prison, even though i saw myself as weak and disabled.
there’s nothing wrong with her.” i pleaded with the guards for hours until they finally relented—which they did mostly to silence me and the other prisoners who were arguing on maryam’s behalf.
you wouldn’t have died.” he turned her over to a female prisoner who worked in the office, with orders to take her to the clinic.
they looked like african famine victims, ravaged by the effects of drugs and without money to buy any food to supplement their prison meals.
by then we had been in prison for almost forty days.
as soon as we felt well enough, we resumed praying for other prisoners.
new prisoners, strangers to us, approached us regularly now.
god will hear you.” maryam two newcomers were very young girls terrified of being in prison.
friends warned me that the prison staff knew we were praying for people, and that we should be careful.
that’s their choice.” marziyeh and i had both prayed often for shahin, the secret christian who’d been imprisoned for owing her brother money.
finally, she decided to call her brother and say she had forgiven him for keeping her in prison.
usually, prisoners were excited to hear their names on the loudspeaker, because it meant they were being released, or that at least their case was moving forward.
six weeks after our arrest, we heard our names on the loudspeaker at evin prison.
our dear friends silva and shirin came into our room at once to ask if we knew why we were being ordered to report to the prison office.
without ever seeing the charges against us in writing or speaking to a lawyer, we were being sent to the dreaded 209, the section set aside for political prisoners, where silva had been kept in solitary confinement for eight months and where shirin had been beaten unconscious and had her teeth knocked out.

i am with the ministry of intelligence and usually handle the cases of christian prisoners.
“there are many criminals over in the public side of the prison, and it isn’t appropriate for people like you to mingle with them.” “those criminals are also human beings,” i said.
they want to know what we believe in that’s worth going to prison for.
but i’ve learned more about iran and islam at evin prison than i could have learned in any university.
“but i respect god’s will above my own, and i think his will has been for me to come into this prison to witness the suffering and injustice here.
“and you think about why most christians get out of prison in a week or two but you’re still here.” maryam while marziyeh was being questioned by mr. mosavat, i sat alone in my tiny room, listening to their conversation.
“we could put her in prison for this.
i had all the prison doctoring i want in ward 2.” “you sound upset.
the health and lives of prisoners are worthless to you—” “they are convicts,” mr. mosavat snapped, interrupting me, “and they should be treated as such!
you two, on the other hand, are distinguished ladies and shouldn’t be kept with prisoners.
“i don’t want to know about other prisoners,” he continued.
is there anything you want to report?” “first of all,” i said, “those ‘other prisoners’ are human beings.
“how can someone who is poisoned not be taken to the clinic?” “eighty prisoners will say they witnessed it.” “we will definitely look into this.” mr. mosavat paused briefly.
we followed a guard across the yard to the women’s prison and ward 2.

during dinner the first night i was there, two prisoners got into a fight.
she had been in prison for three years on a murder charge.
she had never seen a lawyer during her three years of imprisonment because she couldn’t afford one.
once an execution is ordered, the prisoner is taken into solitary confinement for her last night.
the false news that she was alive had been spread because the prison officials feared an uprising once word got out of what had really happened.
she had never complained about anything during her three years in prison and didn’t complain at the last—never begged for her life, never asked for mercy.
mrs. niromand said that even the prison guards were crying.
she had been a prisoner for years in a marriage that was a nightmare of abuse, forced to remain there by a law that holds a man’s sexual pleasure above the most basic rights of human decency and dignity for women.

her father was in the public ward of the prison, and mahtab had been allowed to see him only once.
“we’ve heard about the dangerous, high-profile political prisoners in 209,” i said.

now if we’re killed outside this prison, our friends will know you’re responsible.” “you’re not worth killing at the risk of our careers and reputations,” mr. sedaghat snapped.
the isolation of the tiny, windowless cells, the nearly silent ward, wearing blindfolds everywhere, and being surrounded by other prisoners i could never see were hard conditions to endure.
i’d rather stay with them than with muslims.” the prison officials had hoped that  mahtab could convince me that christianity was a mistake and that i should embrace the true faith of islam.
another hard thing to endure was hearing the disembodied voices of other prisoners we had never seen, crying out in agony.

“behave yourself if you want to stay out of prison,” one of the guards said.
look at how the regime imprisons young mothers and tortures teenage girls in order to stay in power!” at the same time, there was something genuine about the pain and suffering and the fight for truth inside evin that was entirely absent from the scene on the street.
“do you have any complaints about prison conditions?” “we object to our conditions, and also to being kept in a state of suspense about the  charges against us,” maryam said.

prison conditions  are very difficult, but it’s nothing compared to jesus’ sacrifice.
“i’m in prison for telling the truth.” the argument escalated into a shouting match, though finally the guard realized her mistake and let me call my sister.
we wrote to the head of the prison, asking to be returned to ward 2 in the public section.
the prison warden soon had bigger concerns than our letters.
as we were being processed back into the ward, an elderly guard asked if we were political prisoners.
“we came from 209, but we’re not political prisoners,” maryam told her.
couldn’t you commit a better crime?” we went through the security search and changed back into our own clothes, leaving behind the baggy men’s prison uniforms that looked so hilarious.
after the isolation of 209, returning to the public area of evin prison felt almost like being free.
the plaintiff against her, who had seemed so unmovable, had come to the prison one day and waived her complaint.
mercedeh had been desperate to get out of prison.
will i ever see the whole thing again?” it is the universal lament of prisoners everywhere: seeing only a little square of sky reminds them of their isolation from the world and makes them long for more.

“when i phoned my mother today, i learned that the court might sentence me to life in prison as an accomplice to the murder my husband committed.
and what am i doing with this child in prison anyway?” “dear pouneh,” i said sternly, “i understand your situation.
though at first other prisoners resented her for taking so much room, the dolls, hangings, and other decorations she put up made the place more attractive for everybody.
after a few nights, rozita introduced us to her as the “faith prisoners.” “you’re lucky to have god on your side,” she said.
if i can’t live and act according to the principles of my faith, then i’m not free, whether i’m in prison or outside.

they said if i didn’t cooperate, they’d keep me in prison and pass a heavy sentence on me.
she was an unusually generous person who bought food for the poorest prisoners.
i’ve seen you praying for other prisoners and being kind to them, but i’ve avoided getting close to you.” “we noticed that,” i said.
as the postelection protests intensified, the prison became more crowded than ever.
many new prisoners, especially young girls, were sent to our room because we’d gotten a reputation for being able to calm newcomers down and make them less afraid.
when other prisoners didn’t want to hear their crying or answer their questions anymore, they sent them to “the christian girls.” marziyeh and i liked meeting new arrivals because they brought the latest news from outside.
if we hadn’t been in prison, we wouldn’t have had the chance to leave our messages at vozara and ward 209.
if maedeh hadn’t been in prison, she never would have seen them and we never would have met her.
now that we were in prison, we could talk openly about our faith.
whereas before we had searched for people to speak to, now they came looking for us: “go see the christian girls!” the very prison system that tried to silence us was now our megaphone: our arrest, our story, and our message of faith were news around the world.
she kept telling stories about inmates, spreading rumors, and trying to turn one prisoner against another.
from now on, i will deal with them the same way.” the rest of us in the room discussed whether we should complain directly to mrs. rezaei, the warden of the women’s prison.
we knew from experience that prison officials were more careful with political prisoners because they were more likely than others to spread the news of how they were treated.
“she also has a habit of telling new prisoners all about the other inmates.
she would be moved away from the political prisoners and in with the murderers.
she told me she was still in prison partly because her husband, an islamic fanatic she had left years before, was jealous of her success in the rice trade and was using his government connections to keep her behind bars until she agreed to go back to him.
maryam we had now been imprisoned for nearly six months, including two weeks at the vozara police station and thirty-eight days in isolation in ward 209.
rather than worrying about our release, we focused on getting through each day and reaching out to our fellow prisoners with encouragement and compassion.
we didn’t care about the celebrity; the advantage to us was that it made new prisoners seek us out and ask us questions about our faith.
if my husband could have paid my bail, i wouldn’t be spending the night with these prisoners.
i’m afraid of them.” “all prisoners are not criminals,” i said softly.
“many of the people here are political  prisoners or have been arrested on financial charges.
you don’t have to be afraid of them.” “are you a political prisoner?” the woman asked.
i didn’t think they would keep you here with the regular prisoners.
if you hadn’t come to this prison, you would not have had the chance to meet us.” i added, jokingly, “so you see, being in prison isn’t all that bad.
you don’t have to be ashamed of coming to prison and cry about it.
this room is the best one in the prison, so you’d better keep quiet.” the woman held on to my hand like a child.
another prisoner, mrs. pari, came back from parole with news that her daughter’s home church was praying for us.
in my wildest dreams, i never expected to celebrate my twenty-eighth birthday in prison.
since we had not yet been allowed contact visits, these gifts were smuggled in by families of our friends in prison, who secretly gave them to rozita during one of her contact visits.
my cross necklace was yet another way to attract the attention of new prisoners.
as they were going, one of them said, “it seems like the only reason for us coming to prison was to meet you.” by now, our case had been mentioned in several official reports that were circulated by amnesty international, the united nations, and the european parliament about the brutality of the iranian government.
we knew the iranian judges were much more lenient when accused prisoners begged them for mercy and made them feel important.
within the walls of evin prison, the overcrowding went from extreme to unimaginable, with prisoners packed in so tightly that guards couldn’t even enter our rooms.
we had to stop using windowsills as storage shelves and drying racks because new prisoners had to have the space.
we heard that hundreds of young girls arrested in the streets were downstairs in the drug addict ward, and that hundreds more were being held in schools because the prisons couldn’t take any more.
the only hint we had at the time of the scope of the protest, other than the prison filled to bursting, was through the censored stories on state tv.
then all the prison telephones were disconnected; our last source of information was cut off.
many prisoners accused of fraud and other nonviolent crimes had expected to be released under the newly elected administration.
they had started packing their bags and waited for the prison doors to be opened wide.
they were the first ones to learn that the ashraf camp in iraq, where so many mujahideen prisoners had friends and family, had been attacked by iraqi soldiers, killing or injuring many of the refugees there.
as the crisis in ashraf played out, the authorities told tahereh she was being transferred to another prison with a reputation even worse than evin’s.
the women’s warden made a call, but the person in charge at the other prison was at lunch.
that afternoon, officers from the other prison arrived with a written order and took her away.
one of the other women asked, “why is it that the christians’ prayers and dreams lead prisoners to freedom?” “it isn’t us,” i explained.
once a prisoner knows she will be released, the final few days seem as long and agonizing as all the years before.
after several more days of delay, the prison agreed to let her go with a prison escort to visit her mother in the hospital for a day.
then with a last smile, she turned and was gone through the doors of evin prison to the blue skies and fresh air of freedom.
shirin already had a long history of defying prison rules.
when a top judge was murdered in kurdistan, the regime interrogated all the kurdish prisoners associated with pjak, including shirin.
maryam every so often, we had groups of official visitors at evin prison.
new prisoners kept pouring in, even after we thought our cells couldn’t possibly hold another body.
she did hilarious imitations of the different guards, of soldiers marching, and of other people in the prison.
from the earliest days of our imprisonment, we both had serious health problems.
we felt sick or in pain every day of our imprisonment.
few prisoners observed the fast, but for the entire month, the meals were served only before dawn or after dark.
we continued to avoid the smelly, chemical-laced prison food and bought canned food, jam, and cheese (which we could save for breakfast the next morning) from the shop.
the canned food was always some horrible brand sold only in prisons.
some guards themselves had lesbian encounters with the prisoners.
“make it short!” i told her that the warden had said we could have vitamins in the prison with a doctor’s approval.
which other doctor has seen you?” “i am in prison because of my belief in christianity.
the issue of bringing vitamins into prison has nothing to do with mrs. rezaei.
your condition is not so serious as to need vitamins.” then she yelled to the clerk through the doorway, “next!” our health crisis took an even more dangerous turn when a prisoner came in with a case of swine flu.
none of the sick prisoners received any medicine or treatment.
that was all some of the women could eat; even those who usually ate the prison food couldn’t stomach it when they were this ill.
our lawyer, mr. soltani, who had seemed so capable and dedicated to defending our rights, was still in prison.
with all the interference from the prison and the court, it had taken poor mr. soltani months of fruitless trips, calls, and cajoling to try to complete even that simple step.
a social worker would pass it to mr. aghasi in the prisoners’ visiting hall.
usually, only prisoners who had close ties with the authorities or spent time in the cultural center were allowed these visits, and we had been banned from the center by the director.
the few prisoners who were allowed contact visits met their guests in a different place than where normal visits occurred, a big room downstairs furnished with tables and chairs.
he looked at shirin and then said to me, “well, it wasn’t so bad for you to come to prison.
chapter 19 beyond comprehension marziyeh there was one other kind of visit available by special request from prison authorities.
a shari’a visit was a private meeting between a prisoner and her husband.
we knew she had been imprisoned for murdering her mother-in-law, but we hadn’t heard the whole story.
i confessed for his sake because he can’t stand prison.
now i’ve been in prison for two years.
so many of the women of evin were imprisoned unfairly.
in some cases, the court assigns a public defender to help indigent prisoners, but this was not done for soheila.
i was relieved when they put handcuffs on me and took me to prison, because at least now i had a roof over my head and food to eat.
“i neither regretted what i’d done nor feared the consequences.” she was in prison waiting to see whether her family would agree to forgive her.
maryam a steady stream of prisoners came and went through ward 2 at evin prison.
the next morning, we reported to the office at 6:00 a.m., wearing our long chadors and the silly slippers prisoners had to wear to court.
we weren’t allowed to have shoes because they were another place to store contraband and also because wearing the oversized, goofy-looking prison slippers was humiliating.
we waited in a small, filthy building with other prisoners on their way to court that day, including one who clearly had a bad case of swine flu.
prisoners didn’t all go to court in a group.
we had called our sisters to tell them about our court appearance, and as we pulled out from the prison gate, we saw them waiting in the street to follow us.
i’m sorry we haven’t met yet, but i’m still trying to get the judge’s permission to visit you in prison.
i told him i was defending you and said i wanted permission to visit you in prison.
after about six months in prison, this would be our first meeting with any legal counsel—and we still had not seen the formal charges against us.
a guard walked us about two hundred yards across the courtyard to a separate building where prisoners and their attorneys met.
“otherwise we wouldn’t have spent six months in prison!
whenever you come to this decision, mr. haddad will be willing to meet with you again.” “if we wanted to change our minds,” i said, “we would have done that six months ago and not spent all those days in prison!
in that brief time, mr. aghasi asked us about our prison conditions and the other prisoners in our ward.
we had seen her talking to other lawyers and prisoners, and had caught her looking at us several times from across the room.
are you political prisoners?
how long have you been in prison now?
have you had access to a lawyer from the beginning?” “we have been in prison six months, and this is the first time we’ve talked with a lawyer.” “i’m very happy to see you in person.
i’m here today gathering the latest news on the cases of political prisoners.
some have said they were responsible for the torture and murder of prisoners at the kahrizak detention center.
this also was a stark reminder that prisoners are not the only ones who are captive in iran.
then came the scratchy, raucous wake-up music at 6:30 for morning roll call, followed an hour later by breakfast, the one prison meal per day we could stomach.
in the afternoons, we walked in the prison yard for an hour.
word spread through the ward that some political prisoners from ward 209 were going to be transferred over to our hall.
the flow of prisoners in the public wing had also picked up, and many women came and went in the ward.
maryam and i took on the task of greeting new prisoners, introducing them to other inmates and explaining the rules and traditions of the ward.
i would rather spend the rest of my life in prison if that’s what it takes to stay close to him.
after all, what has landed you here in prison?
it was the tuna i had eaten for dinner, low-quality canned food from the prison store.
the prison’s hilltop location made for chilly nights, even in the summer.
but in a place like evin prison, they mean even more because the prisoners have so little else to encourage them.
returning to live in 209 after two years in prison would be a very bad sign.
“go ahead and execute me.” as long as she had been in prison and as often as she had been questioned, she sensed that her situation was different now.
the authorities were grilling kurdish prisoners to see if they could get any clues in the case.
our unshakable kurdish heroine, who had endured months of torture and years of imprisonment without flinching, suddenly seemed broken and defeated.
i can’t stand this life in prison anymore.” nothing they had done to her had ever made her hesitate.
most prisoners still went out before sunrise for muslim morning prayers, too, and everybody had to go out to register at 6:30.
it was announced that prisoners could receive new clothes from their families.
shamsi was in charge of room 2 and had become a friend, even though she had been a tough gang member on the outside and most prisoners were afraid of her.
she also organized a system for bartering and buying clothes among the prisoners, and got clothes for the poorest prisoners, who couldn’t afford their own.
we seldom knew why the prison administration changed a policy.
in the wake of all the protests, the arrest of some of the judges, and the overcrowded conditions at evin, the guards became much stricter about prisoners going outside for morning roll call.
in the past, old and sick prisoners had been excused.
out of bed and into the prison yard for roll call!” anyone who disobeyed was denied access to the cultural center, lost her phone privileges, and wasn’t allowed visitors or parole.
some of the sick prisoners shivered with cold just getting out of bed, never mind going outside.
after that, everyone except for marziyeh and me and a few political prisoners had to face mecca and recite in arabic the omalyajib prayers.
the guards were hoping to make the old and weak prisoners out to be the enemy, getting us to blame them instead of the guards for the inconvenience, and causing disagreements or even fights among the prisoners.
though a number of women went to the cultural center, the yard was packed with prisoners.
after a while, some of the prisoners started sitting and lying on the ground, which made the crowding even worse.
some of our guards warned us angrily that our voices were reaching the guards in the men’s prison and making them sexually excited.
the reason, we believed, was that the prison warden, mr. sedaghat, was under some kind of pressure to show that his prisoners were happy, well cared for, and being educated at his cultural center, where they were all behaving like nice muslim women.
on top of everything else, the prisoners who were drug addicts were allowed into the cultural center for the first time, making it harder than ever to get a place there.
any sort of coordinated prison protest was almost unknown in evin.
marziyeh and i had been banned from the cultural center since the beginning of our imprisonment.
when we told mrs. rezaei, the women’s prison warden, about it, she had said we should be allowed to go.
you are aware that the prison clinic doesn’t provide proper medical care.
defiant prisoners will be sent to the security section.
in the meantime, you should go out for the roll call like everybody else, because mr. sedaghat won’t make any exceptions.” “maybe mr. sedaghat should deal with the problem of the worthless prison clinic and its outdated drugs,” i replied, “or the lack of proper hot food on these cold autumn days, before he decides to make these new rules about the morning count.
most prisoners were afraid of the guards and obeyed their every word.
however, political prisoners like shirin were different.
but even some of the prison staff were now saying that the crowding situation was impossible and that the cultural center could no longer function.
prisoners needed to stand up for their rights.
of course, none of the prison administrators would admit that our actions had made any difference.
she was transferred from 209 because the media were less likely to hear about her strike in the general ward than in the ward for political prisoners.
“did you know that christian prisoners are given asylum more easily now since you’ve been arrested and put in prison?” “how could this be related to us?” maryam asked.
reihaneh wanted to write a complete report of the plight of women in prison, an exposé of the abuse, corruption, and evil that made up the fabric of the iranian prison system.
with help from some other prisoners, i listed the names of every inmate, their charges, the year they were arrested, and all the details of their stories.
reihaneh made notes about the terrible medical care, the bad food, and the predatory lesbianism that was so widespread—and that, before the security cameras were in place, had routinely led to the rape and beating of new prisoners.
the trip to the visitors’ center—the long wait at the women’s prison, the minibus ride, another wait at the visitors’ center, the ride back, and still another wait to be frisked before returning to ward 2—took even longer this time than usual.
back at the women’s prison, in line waiting to be searched, i leaned against the office wall, exhausted from hours of standing.
it was very unusual to see men in the women’s prison unannounced.
the guards immediately ordered the prisoners to cover their hair completely.
how long have you been in prison?” “seven months.” “and are you still a christian?” “yes, i am a christian.” “what have you decided to do?
during the entire exchange, the rest of the prisoners waiting to be searched had been absolutely silent.
“who were they?” “they’re from the security section of the ministry of intelligence.” to the other inmates, it was a case of famous security officials coming to visit a famous prisoner.
the men had instructed some other prisoners to get marziyeh up to talk with them.
it looked as if somehow, miraculously, the regime was starting to feel serious heat about keeping us in prison.
“these gentlemen are from the security section of the prison,” mrs. rezaei explained.
“because they give all sick prisoners the same medicine, no matter what’s wrong with them, and it has no effect whatsoever.
“he was in prison in another city at the time, but told me about it.
“i can help you get whatever you want from outside the prison—medicine, vitamins, blankets, clothes—just let me know.” we told him we’d been trying to get vitamins for months.
and the new rule is only making matters worse—the terrible health care combined with the requirement to go outside in the cold every morning is making the sick prisoners sicker, and the ones who aren’t sick yet are going to catch something.” “i know these problems very well,” mr. ramezani admitted.
the people who imprisoned you say this wasn’t so, but they’re making a huge mistake.
we had been arrested, harassed, humiliated, and in prison for seven months for saying what this high prison official—seemingly feared and obeyed by everyone—was saying right in front of us in the office of the women’s warden.
marziyeh a few days later, our new lawyer, mr. aghasi, came to visit us in prison again.
the judge there, who was also the judge in shirin alam hooli’s case, was famous for sentencing prisoners to death or to life in prison.
after that, i’ll call you in.” we had been in prison almost eight months.
and as you know, the sentence for this crime is the death penalty for men and life imprisonment with labor for women.” the judge looked at our lawyer.
the judge was visibly startled by such a bold statement from a prisoner whose freedom seemed so close at hand.
“we believe the lord is our ultimate liberator, and we don’t want to be released from prison under any circumstances if it means denying christ.
if we had wanted to be freed by denying our faith, we could have gotten out of prison months ago.
he thought he was doing a heroic job to save us from life in prison, and here i was undoing all his effort!
“in serious cases that normally end with a sentence of life imprisonment or death, this court, the court of revolution, does not get involved,” the judge said.
he asked about the conditions inside evin prison, especially the medical care.
“i don’t believe you have any perfume in prison.
“thank you, but i don’t think the prison staff would allow us to take this bottle into our ward,” i said.
then he wrote a note saying that the perfume was a personal gift from judge pirabbasi and must be allowed into the prison.
our appetites gone, we gave our sandwiches to other prisoners waiting for the bus.
the regime should apologize to us because they’d arrested and imprisoned us without reason.
maryam a few days later, marziyeh and i were called to the prison office, where a grumpy guard named izadi was on duty.
she often swore at prisoners, especially when she was talking on the loudspeaker.
“these items are for these two prisoners,” he said calmly but with authority to izadi.
he also wanted me to tell you that you will soon be released from prison.
“now your prison term is over, and you must be freed,” he went on.
our visitor stepped out of the room for a few minutes to see another prisoner who knew him and had heard he was in the office.
while our guard was alone with us, he asked, “are you the two christian prisoners who get all the mail?” “yes, we are.
“if so, he should have sent a written order to the prison office.
the judge knows perfectly well that words don’t mean anything in prison; everything has to be done through official written orders.
i think, in any case, he will order that you get the letters after you’ve been released, because there are so many of them, and prisoners aren’t allowed to receive letters anyway.” by the time we returned to ward 2, our meeting with mr. ramezani had already made headlines.
we heard later that our visitor had stayed to talk with several other women prisoners after we left so as not to raise suspicions that he had come again only to see us.
it was very unusual for prisoners to return to 209 after their cases had been heard by the revolutionary court.
fereshteh told us that it usually meant a prisoner’s sentence was either going to be extended or applied.
he asked how long i had been in prison.
so they arrested and imprisoned us just for fun, and christian converts don’t really face the death penalty?
i believe it is the lord’s will that marziyeh and i should be in prison, and that our freedom lies in his hands alone.
of course, we don’t like staying in prison and we would rather be free, but we prefer to wait for the lord’s decision on the matter.” i was irritated at mr. dolatabadi’s attitude and his remark that he had the power to release us.
we’ve been in prison and have had no news of what’s going on in the outside world.
however, it’s only natural for the vatican to get involved with our case because we have been imprisoned on charges of being christians and believing in jesus.” (we never learned any more about the vatican’s reported involvement.)
the men offered us sweets and treated us like honored guests rather than prisoners threatened with death.
mr. dolatabadi asked lots of questions about conditions inside evin—food, medical care, our general health—as if he, the city’s chief prosecutor, had no idea what went on in the city’s prisons.
i started telling him about the ridiculous rule requiring every prisoner to go outside for the morning roll call, regardless of her condition.
rezaei, miss amirizadeh and miss rostampour are in my office and have complained about some prison problems.” there was anger in his voice.
“besides, after nearly nine months in prison under these charges, we want to see our case resolved.
the sight of the food amazed the guards in the ward 2 office, who were used to seeing prisoners return from 209 exhausted and worried, and sometimes bruised and bleeding.
marziyeh and i split one container of food and gave the other to some other prisoners  who were in the room.
mr. dolatabadi’s brief phone call had ushered in a new world inside evin prison, at least for the moment.
parvaneh, the prisoner who made a little money as the cleaner of our room, asked for our autographs to prove she had shared a cell with two such famous people.
he asked me to speak with you, as there are a few points we’d better tell you before you leave prison.
it was probably  the first time the head of the security section had called a prisoner to congratulate her on her release.
when maryam told another prisoner that mr. ramezani had called us, the woman joked, “now it’s president ahmadinejad’s turn to come visit you in prison!” while the final chapters of our story were playing out, other prisoners were hearing news both good and bad about their charges.
no matter how long it takes, we will be waiting to hear from you and celebrate your freedom.” after the comings and goings of prisoners over the months, our closest remaining friend was shirin alam hooli.
as we had learned from following our friends’ cases, it often happens in iranian courts that prisoners are released on bail but the charges are never settled or dropped.
every night, we wondered whether this would be our last night in evin prison.
never in our lives would we form friendships as deep and rich as the ones god had blessed us with behind the high and foreboding walls of evin prison.
late in the afternoon, shirin, marziyeh, and i went for a walk in the prison yard, holding hands.
i wonder if i’ll ever see the whole sky again, instead of only a piece of it framed by a window or a prison wall.” she looked around the courtyard with the sad stump where the lone tree had been, the wet ground, the numbingly familiar walls.
only god knew whether he was finished with us in ward 2, room 1 of iran’s most feared and brutal prison.
but because prisoners were never released before noon, we encouraged everybody to go to their morning activities.
then the women began to sing the song we sang whenever a political prisoner was released: “go, go, and never come back!” i heard the sound of a plate shattering on the floor in our honor.
at the end of the hall, the guards told the other prisoners they couldn’t walk any farther.
we moved through a series of checkpoints to a spot near the main gate of evin prison.
usually when prisoners are released, all their friends and family are there to welcome them.
though my body was free, my soul and spirit were still with our precious friends suffering terrible injustice inside evin prison.
from the window in our apartment, we could see the walls of evin prison in the distance.
we had never once cried for ourselves in prison.
when prisoners leave, the other inmates ask for their phone numbers in order to keep in touch.
first on our schedule was a visit to the doctor to begin treatment for the long list of health problems prison life had brought us or made worse: maryam’s damaged ear and ulcer, my aching back, headaches, tooth problems, and kidney troubles.
we spent far more time with our new friends—fellow prisoners who had also been released, and those still awaiting their fate behind the walls of evin.
for nine months in evin prison, we had spent every day praising jesus and proclaiming his gospel.
we also wanted to ask him about getting the letters that had been sent to us in prison.
he said that even though, at his suggestion, our judge had ruled we could have our letters, the prison office had overruled him and destroyed them all.
we hesitated to visit the home of a powerful man in the iranian prison system, particularly since we knew we were being watched constantly.
here was a man whose name struck fear in  the hearts of all the guards and officials at evin prison cooking lunch for us in his own home.
after talking with her for a few minutes, we deduced that her husband had helped many other prisoners deal with unfair conditions.
he then shared some of his own beliefs and said he had spent years in prison for his opposition to islam.
he recommended we not pursue the matter ourselves, because some court officials were very angry that we were out of prison.
there’s no reason for you ladies to bring one with you!” more likely, he was concerned that mr. aghasi knew the law and wouldn’t allow him to take advantage of us as he usually did with ex-prisoners trying to get their property back.
“have you been in prison all this time for believing in jesus christ?” he asked.
they must have kept you in prison on phony charges, too.
but in so doing, he helped us spread the message of jesus among the neediest people—the prisoners of evin— and gave us worldwide publicity we never could have gotten on our own.” the young officer could only shake his head as he walked away.
she was a strong girl who could stand up to prison life as long as she knew the end was in sight.
one of the best stories was from our friend fereshteh, who had suffered with multiple sclerosis in ward 209 and was under the threat of life imprisonment or death.
furthermore, since she had already been in prison for a year, she had only one more year to go.
mahtab told us about going every week with her father-in-law to visit her fiancé, who was still in prison in another city.
the smallest gift or expression of kindness is vastly more meaningful inside prison than on the outside.
a couple of months after our release, as the new year’s holiday approached, marziyeh and i went to the market and bought a whole armload of clothes and gave them to relatives of the prisoners to deliver for us.
shirin called later to say that her brother, esa, had learned that her sentence would be life in prison.
all the political prisoners have been moved together in room 6; they argue politics constantly.
but i won’t stay in here forever.” the commutation of her sentence to life in prison, plus the worldwide response to her letter, made us hopeful that in time her prison term might be reduced even more.
shirin will have it in a few days.” judge salavati, known as “the killing judge,” was famous for sentencing prisoners to death.
as soon as my soul leaves my body, i’ll fly to your house because it’s the closest to evin prison.
maryam and i knew there was a chance we might be sent to prison again.
though we had been physically released from evin prison, we were still held captive by a regime that monitored our every move and could arrest us again at any time.
while marziyeh began tracing the story on the internet, i took a taxi to evin prison.
marziyeh met me at the prison gate.
she’d gone to visit the prisoners in room 2.
we would have to go there for the body, but here at the prison we could pick up shirin’s belongings.
a guard at the cemetery said that, yes, the bodies of the executed prisoners were there, but no one could see them without written permission from the court.
the next morning, we went back to the main gate at evin prison, where a large crowd had gathered.
guards watching the people in front of the prison took special notice of us.
about noon, the relatives of another executed prisoner arrived and said the court had refused to release the bodies because they were afraid of a protest or riot.
instead, they gave cards to the dead prisoners’ relatives and told them they could present them at the cemetery and collect the bodies later, when the threat of a riot had passed.
the sisters and brothers of farzad and shirin and the others live on.” the lawyer for the executed kurds had been in prison himself.
we lived in antalya for nearly a year, traveling back and forth to the un office in ankara and writing the journals of our imprisonment that are the basis for this book.
if anyone had told us five years ago that by now we would have spent more than nine months in an iranian prison, been threatened with death, had our story told around the world, written a book (in english, no less), and moved to atlanta, georgia, we would have said they were crazy.
[5] “prisoners of conscience/medical concern,” amnesty international, ua 95/09, iran, april 8, 2009, http://www.amnesty.org/fr/library/asset/mde13/030/2009/fr/6878ab7e-f6de-4948-9a1b92ad7e06ca3f/mde130302009eng.pdf.
after they were freed from evin prison, it would have been both easy and understandable if they had gone to a safe, quiet place to rebuild their lives away from public view.
for eight months, they wrote, recalling every friendship, every court appearance, every emotion, every key event of their prison experience.
as difficult as it was to write about what they had seen and experienced, they eventually filled 1,900 handwritten pages with the history of their ministry and their time in evin prison.
in march 2009, maryam and marziyeh were arrested in tehran for promoting christianity —a capital crime in iran—and imprisoned for 259 days in the city’s notorious evin prison.
eventually, maryam and marziyeh were released from prison and cleared of all charges.
they consider it an honor to have experienced a little of christ’s suffering by being imprisoned in his name.

when referring to some intelligence agents and prison guards, i created nicknames because they never told me their real names.
in prison, i was prohibited from having a pen and paper, but i had plenty of time to review conversations and events over and over in my mind, and after my release, i spent much of the next several weeks writing down my recollections.
of course, memory has its shortcomings, and not all of the dialogue from my imprisonment is repeated verbatim here.
my modest farsi-reading skills, combined with a growing sense of unease, were hindering my comprehension of what appeared to me as: qeruzjiojitenajkfasdf azntxcjviorgtneafn 24 hours serjiojasfkjzfnty znernagyrhgbfg evin prison ewatngnmdfv.
evin prison?
“evin prison.” my heart began to pound.
this tehran jail was notorious for having held iran’s most famous political prisoners, including students, academics, and activists.
“and if we are not satisfied, we can take you to evin prison tonight.” this had to be a very, very bad dream, worse than any nightmare i could remember.
as the story went, she had been arrested after taking photos of some prisoners’ families outside evin and then responded defiantly to her interrogators.
i was frightened, bewildered, and furious: frightened at the prospect of landing in evin prison, bewildered by the presence of four strange men seizing my belongings, and furious at this violation of my privacy.
yet forced public confessions, in which prisoners often expressed regret for their actions, denounced colleagues, and asked for forgiveness, were an institutionalized feature of iran’s intelligence apparatus.
the driver kept going, straight to evin prison.
an iranian friend had insisted on driving me past the prison, which was located on a hill in an upper-class neighborhood of northern tehran, close to the alborz mountains.
now, as our car pulled up to the prison gate, i could no longer deny the reality of what was happening to me.
i trembled, thinking of how many thousands of prisoners had been detained, tortured, and executed in this prison since it was built by mohammad reza shah in the 1970s and expanded after the islamic revolution.
i told him i had been using a special acne ointment, which was in the bag i had brought to prison.
after his photo appeared on the cover of the economist magazine, holding up a shirt splattered with the blood of a fellow protestor, he was given a death sentence, which was later reduced to several years’ imprisonment in evin.
in 2008, when he was briefly allowed out of prison for medical treatment, he escaped to neighboring iraq and was later granted political asylum in america.
i had been such an idiot to think that my research wasn’t that risky, that i would at most be interrogated and not land in prison, that iranian intelligence agents would be rational enough to see the harmless nature of my work, and that they would believe me if i told the truth.
“allaho akbar, allaho akbar!” a muezzin’s voice bellowed through the prison loudspeakers, “god is great, god is great!” tall walls appeared all around me as i opened my eyes and felt the cold seeping through my body, reminding me that the previous day had been all too real.
accounts of sexual assault in iran’s prisons were not uncommon, and i didn’t know if these men would touch me, or worse.
every few feet, i bumped into a desk or chair or barely dodged the shoes of a few seated men i assumed to be prison employees.
“miss saberi,” came a voice, gruff despite its singsong accent particular to central iran, “if you cooperate today, by tomorrow evening, you will be continuing this conversation with my colleagues in the comfort of the esteghlal hotel, not in evin prison.” the esteghlal hotel was just down the hill from the prison.
“but if you don’t cooperate,” haj agha continued, “you could end up staying in prison for a long, long time.
women’s rights activists, students, unionists, journalists, bloggers, academics, politicians, and many others had been summoned here on political charges, although the regime liked to refer to them as “security” prisoners, not “political” ones.
local journalists and bloggers continued to be interrogated or given prison sentences.
then, looking at the guard, he said, “she can make one phone call today from prison.” as we were leaving, i glanced over my shoulder to read the sign outside the antechamber where we had just been.
“miss saberi,” came my bâzju’s voice, dark and intense, “if you don’t cooperate, we will have you sentenced to ten years in prison.
“picture what you’ll look like after twenty years in prison.
“did you ever think you’d end up in prison?” he asked.
“i thought if you had questions, you might interrogate and release me, not imprison me.” “well,” he said, with a snide chuckle, “we wanted to wait and see if you changed your ways on your own.
group hangings often made headlines, with many victims accused of drug trafficking and armed robbery, although human-rights activists believed some were political prisoners.
juveniles were sometimes executed, as were some prisoners found guilty of security-related crimes, including an iranian telecommunications salesman convicted of espionage who was hanged in 2008.
i had heard that physical threats against prisoners’ family members was one torture technique used in the islamic republic.
in this prison, these hard-line fanatics held all the power, and according to their worldview, i couldn’t possibly be innocent.
it is impossible to be gandhi in evin prison.
“miss saberi, do you want to rot in this prison?” he yelled.
he kept reminding me that if i didn’t cooperate, i would perish in prison.
the sign on my cell wall, the one i had ignored two nights before, quoted ayatollah khomeini: prisons must be colleges for human improvement.
“the sign in my cell quotes imam khomeini saying, ‘prisons must be colleges for—’” “‘—human improvement,’” he finished the sentence for me.
i didn’t mean you, you lowlife, i seethed, as i wiped my face with the sleeve of my prison roopoosh.
it was common knowledge that iran’s intelligence apparatus was obsessed with gathering even the most trivial information on virtually anyone, in many cases for no apparent reason, and that this was a routine part of the interrogation process for many prisoners.
getting videotaped was inevitable if i was to be freed, just like many of the political prisoners before me who had endured similar ordeals.
i was so ashamed of what i had done in this prison.
javan had earlier assured me that because i had agreed to collaborate with him and his colleagues, they would never broadcast the video—unless i “made trouble” when i got out of prison.
a woman guard had ordered me to put them on that morning, just as other prisoners i had seen on iranian tv were dressed in their personal attire.
the ministry became notorious for intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and periodic executions and assassinations, and it was rarely answerable to others.
i was trapped in solitary confinement in evin prison.
so did the intermittent whimpering of the prisoner next door.
how could these people imprison an old, ill woman?
javan had boasted that the prison staff ate the same food as the detainees.
i guessed our captors didn’t want to give prisoners one more thing to complain about once they were released.
the shutter over the small, barred window in the door squeaked open, exposing the pretty eyes of the slim, young guard from my first morning in prison.
below this celestial display was written something to the effect of, “anyone who imagines that religion is separate from politics is ignorant.” i wondered whether this poster was meant for the guards or for restive prisoners like me with nothing else to look at.
the price for expressing such ideas could be high—defrocking, imprisonment, even execution.
the evening before, the smiling, rotund guard, whom i had heard the other guards calling  haj khanom, had led me blindfolded and quaking to the prison basement.
my body may be imprisoned, but i can transcend this material world.
at least my interrogator had given me a newspaper to read, a gift that skinny had assured me was a sign of a prisoner’s impending release.
my body would be free, but my conscience would remain imprisoned forever.
despite what i had told myself the night before, i obviously hadn’t convinced myself that i deserved to stay in prison.
i sluggishly gathered my blankets, prison uniform, toothbrush, and toothpaste.
perhaps this cell had once upon a time held an italian prisoner yearning for freedom just as i was.
“my mother wants to know why you’re in prison,” roya translated.
the mko killed scores of senior officials, and the regime imprisoned and executed many of the organization’s supporters.
she had been incarcerated here twice before—once in the 1980s, when several of her fellow prisoners and her brother, who were members of the mko, were executed.
last time she was here, she was transferred to evin’s regular prison, which housed hundreds of women.
the food there was repulsive, roya said, and was spiked with camphor to suppress prisoners’ sexual drive.
some women inmates suffered from lice, narcotics were just as easy if not easier to get than on the streets, and the guards often treated prisoners much more harshly.
but at least in the regular prison, inmates could use the bathroom whenever they wanted and could make phone calls more frequently.
the murderers, as well as women who were imprisoned for financial crimes, were the most educated, so they were the best choice of cellmates for political prisoners, who didn’t have their own section in the regular prison.
i had once read that people convicted of narcotics offenses constituted nearly half of iran’s prison inmates.
at least she was getting free medical care in prison, roya laughed.
i may not have been free, but for the first time after two weeks in solitary confinement, i was having a conversation with someone other than the men who threw me in prison.
you better not have told them why you’re in prison.
one brother had recently been sentenced to three years in prison and the other to six.
“i heard skinny tell another guard we’re being transferred to the regular prison,” she whispered back.
how could i be taken to the regular prison when haj agha had told me i was supposed to be freed?
that night, she found herself in evin prison.
“that’s silva harotonian!” like me, silva was put in solitary confinement while undergoing intense interrogation during her first days in prison.
he later sentenced silva to three years in prison.
although silva had been sentenced to three years in prison, at least when she got out of this place, she would have a clear conscience.
section 209 is for political prisoners.” my belly flipped.
until now, i hadn’t realized i was in a section specifically for political prisoners.
she suffered from back and leg aches, although these had abated after she lost several pounds during her few months in prison.
(every tuesday, detainees were allowed to use their own money to buy a few snacks and raw vegetables through a prison official who brought them from outside evin—although goodies deemed too western, like chips, were not permitted.
when my cellmates learned i had brought only a little cash to prison, they kindly shared their treats with me.)
“when i was imprisoned, the guards saw my hands and looked at me as if i was so frivolous.
like me, silva had never watched much staterun television before landing in prison, but by now, she had memorized all the programs.
but after a while, she realized she was genuinely happy for anyone who could leave this prison.
“i really believe this.” maybe my imprisonment was also part of my destiny, i thought, just as moving to iran had been.
after a few months in prison, silva was allowed to have a bible and a book of christian prayers.
the following morning, azar was summoned to court while silva went to her weekly visit with her mother elsewhere on the prison grounds.
azar laughed as she told us how one of her jailed sons had commented dryly to the judge: “prison isn’t as bad as i thought.
and actually, not everything in prison was free.
we presumed she had received a response to her appeal, but we had no idea whether it had been negative, in which case she might have been transferred to the regular prison, or positive, in which case she would have been set free.
it was wednesday, two days after azar and silva left, and our door had just opened to reveal this small and fragile-looking woman in prison garb.
i recognized her weeping; it was the same high-pitched wailing i had heard coming from a nearby interrogation room during my first week in prison.
vida and i were the first prisoners she had seen since her arrest.
i was only guessing, though, because nothing was predictable in this prison.
nargess had never imagined she would one day end up in prison.
“we made an exception to come here today—a holiday—because we want to get you out of prison soon,” haj agha said, full of self-importance.
he had added, however, that whether and when the concentrated epidemic found among intravenous drug users and prisoners spread to sex workers, homosexuals, and the youth completely depended on the country’s future policies.
vida and nargess had gone through three police dramas by the time i came to a realization that i had been struggling to avoid since my first week in prison: i did not want to be freed for telling lies.
i wanted to recant my false confession—not after my release but while i was still in prison.
“haven’t other prisoners been asked to do that?” i asked.
as the guard drove me back to prison, i started to regret that i hadn’t also told the magistrate my confession was false.
this time, a thin, young woman in loose-fitting prison pajamas shuffled in.
sara and her fiancé had predicted they might one day end up in prison.
imprisonment, i knew, was one risk iranian students faced for political activism, which had been growing increasingly dangerous—especially after hard-liners expanded their control over universities following ahmadinejad’s 2005 victory.
i immediately made two: that no one would ever be harmed because of the falsehoods i had told in this prison and that i would be freed within the week.
she refused to walk around the prison yard, despite the fact that the twenty- to thirty-minute sessions four times a week were our only chance to go outside.
the yard was insulting, sara declared, and it existed only so that prison officials could announce to the world they were humane enough to give us an opportunity for outdoor exercise.
my reservoir of tears, which had released only a few trickles during my five weeks in prison, now came pouring out.
that was where my fellow prisoners and i were allowed to fill our plastic water bottles and throw out our garbage—tasks we often competed over to break the monotony of our daily lives.
“do some prisoners stay here for years?” i asked, struggling to get the words out.
a male guard loaded me into a van, where he handcuffed me to a young woman prisoner i hadn’t seen before.
two male prisoners sat in front of us, also shackled together.
“don’t speak to one another,” the guard ordered from the passenger seat, before we headed out the prison gate and toward the revolutionary court.
my guard admonished the man for talking to me and took the other woman prisoner and me into the magistrate’s office.
for the next half hour or so, i waited as the magistrate interrogated my fellow prisoner by having her write down answers to his written questions.
in sum: truth = prison.
but now i would rather tell the truth and risk staying in prison than win my release by telling lies.
without speaking, the magistrate held out a tissue box, as if he was used to dealing with distraught prisoners.
she and i were to wait here for the two male prisoners who had come to court with us.
in the car on the way back to evin, i reflected on javan’s words: “we knew from the very beginning that it was a lie.” i wondered how often my captors and their colleagues deliberately made false accusations against other prisoners, too.
the guard led me to a van outside section 209, where several male prisoners were waiting.
“i knew it,” the older man gloated, then announced, “i haven’t decided yet how long i will keep you in prison—maybe a few months, maybe one or two years.” i was confused.
but whoever this man was, he seemed to be more influential than anyone else i had encountered during my imprisonment.
still, being out of prison and prohibited from going abroad would be better than sitting behind bars.
you may think my research and reporting are reason enough to keep me in jail, but what i said here today was the complete truth.” haddad listened calmly, but when he began speaking, a cloud passed over his face: “why is it that the u.s. has guantánamo bay and abu ghraib, yet when we imprison an american woman for one month, the world cries out, ‘violation of human rights’?” by referring to these places, haddad seemed to be taking his resentment against america out on me.
iran and other muslim countries had been particularly outraged by graphic reports of u.s. soldiers abusing detainees at iraq’s abu ghraib prison in 2004.
in the van on the way back to evin, my fellow prisoners joked with one another.
human-rights activists criticized mortazavi for imprisoning many activists, students, and bloggers, and they accused him of involvement in the death of journalist zahra kazemi, a charge he denied.
it was impossible for me to decipher what was going on behind the scenes and outside this prison.
khorramshahi was waiting for me when a male guard took me to a small building just inside the prison gate and into a room filled with several cubicles, where lawyers were meeting with their clients.
the guards prohibited tweezers, but sara had filched a piece of black thread a few days earlier, when haj khanom had given her a needle and some thread to patch a hole in her prison uniform.
sara and i were left to debate whether she had been freed or transferred to the regular prison, where she might meet other relatives of mko members.
a grassroots campaign had been endeavoring to collect one million signatures to push for changing such laws, even though the authorities had threatened and imprisoned many of its volunteers.
on wednesday morning, sara was taken to court, while a guard we prisoners had named cheeks, for her chubby face, informed me that i had another meeting with my attorney.
the only time i had been informed of any charges was on my second day of imprisonment, and back then, i was accused of acting against national security.
why should i have even been imprisoned in the first place?” “you must continue to have hope,” khorramshahi chided me.
i am in prison!” cheeks told me my time was up.
but i, it seemed, would be spending my iranian new year in a prison cell.
i couldn’t help thinking that if i had waited to withdraw my confession until after my release, as some previous prisoners had done, i would most likely have been freed by now.
executions gradually halted, and the number of imprisonments diminished, but baha’is continued to be barred from government posts and blocked or expelled from universities.
despite the gravity of these accusations, the prisoners had never been allowed to see their attorneys, abdolfattah soltani and shirin ebadi.
the seven leaders had even agreed to their captors’ demand to dissolve the  national and local baha’i assemblies in iran, but they remained imprisoned, along with nearly thirty other baha’is throughout the country.
we always try to keep in mind the repercussions that our actions in prison might have for other baha’is.” “in other words,” mahvash explained, “we do what we think is right.
i explained, telling her and fariba how i had retracted my false confession and how haddad had decided to keep me imprisoned.
“because i’m angry that i’m stuck in prison for having told the truth.” “we generally don’t believe in hunger strikes,” fariba said.
the women jotted down the new words with a pen their interrogator had given them after they had spent several months in prison.
i had spent my previous nowruz with bahman and his mother in iran’s kurdistan province; the one before that, with friends, also in kurdistan; the one before that, in tehran; the one before that,…it was now my seventh nowruz in iran, and my first in prison.
she had told the prison guards she had no appetite, but in reality she had deliberately refrained from consuming  anything except tea.
i had menstruated three of the past five weeks, my heart had begun to palpitate violently a few times a day since my hyperventilation episode in solitary, and my skin had broken out in a rash from my synthetic prison-issue sweatshirt.
i then asked if he would permit me to get dental floss, a hairbrush to replace the flimsy plastic comb the guards gave to prisoners, and a soft blanket to cushion my sore tailbone.
the next day, the prison authorities took parisa to a hospital outside evin.
please, just listen.” i explained how the deputy prosecutor had decided not to free me and how he had warned that i might have to stay in prison for up to two years.
“we’re trying everything we can to get you out of prison.
they decided to free her at the end of march, after the prison doctor gave her a checkup in front of them and she had failed the exam with flying colors.
the women i most admired had used the challenges they faced for their own improvement while setting examples for others, both in and out of prison.
“it’s the women from the regular prison,” she said.
she was always the most likely to treat inmates as ordinary human beings, the only guard who would guide blindfolded prisoners by the hand instead of tugging at our chadors or grabbing our arms.
from what i had witnessed, the other guards were usually civil but not always kind to prisoners.
if we weren’t, why would we be in prison?
the walls of my cell were to be repainted, presumably to cover the etchings left behind by former inmates, to prevent them from passing on words of solace or guidance that could help new prisoners when they needed it most.
so after i had spent four days alone, skinny was moving me into another cell in a corridor that she said had previously housed male prisoners.
in prison, we had never been served this western delicacy, but the night before, i had dreamed of them.
this time, however, instead of being driven to the right, in the direction of the building where i had last met khorramshahi, i was taken to the left, toward another building in the prison compound.
there i spotted mahvash, fariba, and five men in prison uniforms, presumably their baha’i colleagues.
the guard guided me past them and into a large hall where prisoners were sitting with their families at round plastic tables that looked like cheap patio furniture.
i tried to picture this scene—my boyfriend and my parents meeting for the first time, brought together by my imprisonment.
both had wanted to come in; the prison officials had refused.
i assumed from the confident way “baby face” carried himself that he wasn’t just a prison guard.
“i was trying to say that the confession was false, i made it because i was threatened with many years in prison if i didn’t and promised freedom if i did.
it was the prison guard.
“go ahead.” “first of all,” i said, shooting baby face a fiery glare, “i apologize for having eaten food  in prison.
when my parents had remained quiet during the first month of my imprisonment, the authorities had dragged their feet.
“well, i shouldn’t have any extra rights that other detainees don’t have.” “and you’re feeling well?” i was starting to wonder whether my voice was being recorded to be broadcast later to make it seem as if i was having the time of my life in evin prison.
at last, i had learned that engaging in conversation gave interrogators like him an opening to do what they were trained for: to offend, intimidate, and lie; to wear down an inmate’s mind; and to provoke the prisoner with the aim of sparking an instinctively defensive and wordy outburst.
“i would like the same right i have seen granted to some other prisoners: to call my parents once a week on a set day without having to ask you for permission every time.” javan paused.
“do you know why?” “because you think prisoners will kill themselves with it.” “yes, there was an incident some time ago…” “well, if someone really wanted to kill herself, she could use the straps of her blindfold,” i pointed out.
the prison guard was telling me i had to leave, so khorramshahi quickly explained that he had argued i didn’t have any classified materials, my confession was false, and i was simply writing a book.
he had put himself in a great deal of danger by showing up before at evin and now at court, and seeing him for the first time after all these weeks stirred emotions that i had been trying to repress to better cope with prison.
at best, the court would give me a couple of years in prison, and then i would have to appeal again, but to the supreme court.
my father was speaking to an elderly woman who must have been another prisoner’s mother.
inmates’ family members, i had learned, got to know one another during their visits to prison and court, creating a growing network of people united in their resentment against their loved ones’ captors.
“you were under no pressure here.” “what about being threatened that i would stay in prison until i was an ‘old lady’ or even that i could be killed?” “no one ever said that,” javan snapped.
i assumed he meant the regular prison, where my first cellmate roya had suggested i room with the murderers.
i slept bundled in my prison sweatsuit, roopoosh, and chador; my socks; and extra clothes that mahvash and fariba lent me.
i was too feeble to walk during havâ-khori, but one day mahvash and fariba helped me go outside, where i sat and watched them as they circled the concrete yard, kicking a deflated plastic ball another prisoner must have left behind.
“especially you, fariba.” she had told me her father had been tortured in prison years earlier and died shortly after his release.
that would not bode well for political prisoners like us.
in the meantime, however, my cellmates and i hoped ahmadinejad’s government would release some prisoners as a goodwill gesture in the run-up to the june election.
at first, she asked us many questions about ourselves, making me wonder whether she was an informant planted by our captors, as former cellmates had told me sometimes happened in prison.
she believed it was possible to find something to be happy about each day, even in prison, whether it was catching a rare glimpse of the moon through our mesh-covered window or eating a particular meal, even if only rice soaked in oil and topped with one thin slice of zucchini.
we couldn’t hear the prisoner respond.
it was early evening on sunday, april 26, and she and a male guard had driven me to another building on the prison grounds, one i had never been to before.
in prison, i can lie on my back all day, hardly burning any calories.” “they will continue until you stop your strike,” he said.
i knew that my imprisonment had been rough on my parents, but until now they had hardly revealed their suffering.
chapter twenty-two  skinny inspected my hair, pants, and socks when she fetched me from my cell, as the guards normally did whenever prisoners went in and out of section 209.
then i rolled down the sleeve of my prison shirt.
two guards drove a male prisoner and me to the revolutionary court.
i’ve seen the faces of people on hunger strikes, and yours does not show that you haven’t been eating.” i could have ripped off my chador to give him a better look at my scrawny body or told him to ask the prison doctor about my weight loss, but i knew there was no use arguing with a man like this.
he seemed offended when i asked for a clean needle, but given the prevalence of drug addiction and risk of hiv infection among the prison population, i felt the request was necessary.
he felt he had also been imprisoned because he could never rest while i was behind bars.
if you don’t do what they say, they will keep you in prison for years, and who knows what will happen to you then.
finally, as the call to morning prayers arose from the prison loudspeakers, i fell into a dreamless sleep.
and what would he say if i told him i had recently heard that a woman prisoner at evin had been freed only after agreeing to have sex with her interrogator?
baby face replied only that such treatment was “natural for security prisoners.” the tall judge then asked several questions about my book and wanted to know why i had interviewed “so many people.” time passed quickly, and when the trial was finished, i discovered that it had lasted around four hours.
i vowed that if i was given a short sentence, i would try to make the most of my experience with the women in the regular prison.
they seemed intrigued, so i found myself explaining to two iranian prison guards how a young woman went about competing for miss america.
i wished he would just tell me how much longer i would have to remain in prison.
then he informed my lawyers that they could tell my parents to pick me up at the prison in two hours.
their bantering continued until we reached a narrow street near the prison, where the driver stopped in front of a bakery.
i had heard that captors often warmed up to prisoners who were about to be freed, so that when they were released, they would be less likely to badmouth prison officials.
“gather your belongings,” skinny ordered me in the same tone as always, “except for your blankets.” i had heard her and her fellow guards say this to so many other prisoners, and now she was saying it to me.
i wondered when the prisoners who wore those garments would be freed.
another guard drove me toward a prison gate i had not seen before.
my parents led me to a friend’s car, which he had been permitted to drive onto the prison grounds.
as we entered an alley behind evin prison, i looked over my shoulder at the tall walls and barbed wire.
epilogue  my tears were of both joy and sorrow: joy at my freedom but sorrow for the prisoners of conscience i was leaving behind, who were being punished simply because of their peaceful pursuit of basic human rights or for their beliefs.
i now relished the freedoms i had taken for granted before my imprisonment.
“if that tale helped save your life,” he told me, “then i am glad.”  since those early days, i have been gaining new perspectives on my experiences by speaking to former prisoners, human-rights advocates, lawyers, analysts, and others who followed my case.
i discovered that what happened to me was remarkably similar to what many people in iranian prisons endure.
numerous prisoners have suffered harsher treatment; some have reacted much as i did, others have not.
a presidential candidate reported prisoner allegations of rape and sexual abuse, and the authorities acknowledged that at least three people died in custody, although human-rights groups say the death toll was likely higher.
just as i was, many prisoners have been warned that if they did not confess and repent, they wouldn’t be released, and their loved ones could be harmed.
as author and historian ervand abrahamian explained to me, interrogators often give prisoners a list of topics they should mention but let them write their own confession in an attempt to make the wording fit the victim, sound believable, and therefore serve as a tool for swaying public opinion.
as a result of these tactics, captors such as mine like to claim they never force anyone to make a false confession and that prisoners confess voluntarily.
omid memarian, a former iranian journalist who was detained and coerced into making a false confession in 2004, told me that interrogators rarely believe the confessions they force out of prisoners, just as my bâzju eventually admitted knowing from the start that mine was not true.
“even when you learn that they do not believe your confession,” he added, “you still know they can keep you in prison on the false accusations for years.
you even smell your own fear.” not all prisoners, however, are pressured to confess.
for example, high-profile activists, political figures, and people such as silva harotonian and me who have had contacts with americans are more likely to be coerced to confess than are lesser-known prisoners, such as most of my other cellmates.
some prisoners have been released relatively quickly after making confessions.
he was later sentenced to fifteen years in prison on various charges, including espionage, before an appeals court reduced his sentence to five years.
amnesty international has reported that numerous prisoners in iran have even been executed with confessions extracted under duress used as the sole evidence against them.
some prisoners have retracted their confessions before their release, though this can jeopardize their chances at freedom.
many other prisoners have waited to recant until they were freed, and still others have remained quiet.
whether or not prisoners recant, their confessions are widely doubted by ordinary people in today’s iran.
as author abrahamian says, many see such confessions as a sign of being human rather than as a sign of weakness, and they are likely to ridicule the interrogator while pitying the prisoner.
this is required especially of prisoners who are considered social hubs or who have had contacts with many people.
one reason interrogators collect even seemingly insignificant information is to scare future prisoners into talking by making them think their captors know more than they actually do —a method i later realized my interrogators used with me.
according to mirebrahimi, “they want to shatter your character by making you accept these allegations so that you will break and stop resisting during later stages of interrogation.” i have also learned that some prisoners have been falsely accused, as i was, of having classified documents.
lawyers who defy this pressure can end up in prison themselves.
as ebadi told me, “it was all a trick.” maybe, in the end, the iranian authorities promoted this falsehood as my main “crime” because amid the international outcry, they were hoping to save face by presenting a pretext for my imprisonment other than a confession whose validity i had denied while still in custody.
i believe that international pressure had a lot to do with it, publicity of my two-week hunger strike appeared to further annoy my captors, and the regime must have concluded that keeping me in prison would be more costly than releasing me.
at the time of this writing, i am aware of at least two of my former cellmates who are still in prison.
silva harotonian was transferred to the regular prison after her sentence was upheld on appeal, as were those of the alaie brothers.
the authorities have confirmed that iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan is in evin prison.
numerous other journalists were arrested after the 2009 election, making iran the world’s largest prison for journalists, according to reporters without borders.
i hope that day will be what one iranian friend called “a time when everywhere [in iran] will be safe and prosperous, and we will have no political prisoners.” “you must return,” he said, “because iran is your father’s country and because your name is iranian, and you are iranian.” i remain proud of my iranian roots, and it pains me to see the suffering of iranians who endure repression and brutality when peacefully standing up for fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression, association, and assembly.
like many former prisoners, i have emotional scars such as these to deal with, but the lessons i gained from my experiences and my cellmates are helping me heal.
while i wish i had never been imprisoned, i realize my captivity has created this interest.
fargo, north dakota january 2010  acknowledgments  i am deeply indebted to the people who supported me during my six years in iran and my one hundred days in prison.
thank you, simon, for having confidence in me, for paying me to do something i loved, and when i was imprisoned, for helping to coordinate efforts for my release with several news organizations.
without it, it is quite likely i would still be in prison.
the miss north dakota and miss america organizations, the aspen institute, and rotary international, which all knew me before my imprisonment, were also among the many groups that called upon the iranian authorities to release me.
politicians and officials in other countries, including britain, did the same, as did u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon, who on several occasions discussed my imprisonment with the iranian government.
soltani, i have learned, tried several times to see me in prison so that i could sign the papers needed for him to represent me, but the authorities did not let him.
thank you for your hospitality, warmth, and willingness to better acquaint me with my father’s homeland, and for your well wishes and calls for my release when i was in prison.
at the time of my imprisonment, 1,000 tomans was equivalent to just under $1.
notes on sources  in between two worlds, most of my work involved personal observation, experience, and interactions with others during my one hundred days in evin prison and my six years in iran.
haleh esfandiari, my prison, my home: one woman’s story of captivity in iran (new york: harpercollins, 2009), 178.

iran denies having not only political prisoners, but also prisoners of conscience, a term amnesty international uses for people who have never used or advocated violence and who are detained or imprisoned because of their “political, religious or other conscientiously held beliefs, ethnic origin, sex, color, language, national or social origin, economic status, birth, sexual orientation or other status…” not all political prisoners, whom amnesty describes as people accused of politically motivated crimes, are considered prisoners of conscience.

we are all implicated in what she has to say.” —etel adnan, author of master of the eclipse and sitt marie rose “with a courageous act of painful but empowering recollection, shahla talebi restores dignity to an entire generation of political prisoners and rescues the art and craft of memoir.â€westerners, who have too often been assured that in iran young women are readingâ€lolitaâ€while waiting to be liberated by the us marines, will come away with entirely different picture of the country and of a caring, defiant, courageous, and determined woman.
ghosts of revolution is the forbidden and forgotten social history of iran, the moral vindication of a people written from the vantage point of a political prisoner, from the bared life of a liberating conscience.
judiciously poetic, pulling no punches, but above all showing an abiding love for the people of a homeland that is now blessed to have her as its storyteller, shahla talebi reassures the world that the right and the beautiful are still triumphant.” —hamid dabashi, columbia university “ghosts of revolution is both a powerful testimony and an important political act from an author sharing her singular experience of eight years behind prison bars.
with clarity, honesty, and a lack of sentimentality, ghosts of revolution speaks to the resilient nature of the human spirit in the face of adversity and the abyss.” —shirin neshat  “this searing memoir of women’s visceral pain, principled resilience, and redemptive imagination in iran’s brutal political prisons will leave you shaken, forever.
talebi’s voice is remarkable for its generous empathy, its poetry in evoking the tortured humanity of the women with whom she shared her prison experience, and its brilliance in analyzing the dark horrors inflicted on the men and women condemned to these death-spaces that were, in the 1970s and 1980s, and are even today, so strangely tied to the exercise of power in iran.” —lila abu-lughod, columbia university, author of writing women’s worlds “shahla talebi’s observations about language, writing, death, modes of consciousness, the depravity of the state and its prisons, and the experience of love and solidarity in the most abject circumstances in which she found herself speak for themselves.
her portraits of fellow prisoners are unforgettable.

the pleasant summer breeze was gently penetrating the chador covering me, drying the sweat of prison on my body.
no car was allowed to drive into the street on which the prison was located except for those of the prison employees.
but i was preoccupied with the reality inside the prison cell.
i had seen and lived all this years before, in 1978, the first time out of prison, when my parents did everything humanly possible to make sure that nothing would upset me, terrified that prison had already pushed me to the edge and if pushed further, i could easily go mad.
both times, my arrest occurred after the harshest crackdown on opponents under each regime, yet at the beginning of changes in prison conditions.
within prisons and the country, which had itself turned into a larger prison, the ambiance felt deadly suffocating.
obviously, this did not prevent the regime from subjecting prisoners to this so-called white, or soft, torture.
it did not stop the regime, for example, from forcing prisoners to stand on their feet for days and nights, violently waking them up every time they seemed to have fallen sleep or when moving one leg up to give it a rest.
she was brought to my cell, only for about half an hour, in the early weeks of my imprisonment in 1977.
but while in the hallway, her face was covered with a jacket, a piece of prison uniform.
later, during my second imprisonment (1983–1992), under the islamic republic, i would meet several prisoners who had mastered this “skilltrick” of sleeping while awake and being awake while asleep.
pori, who had spent ten months during 1983–1984 in the so-called tabootha (graves) or dastgahha (machines), the extreme punishment ward in ghezel hesar prison, was one of those prisoners who had challenged the boundaries of sleep and waking states, stretching their threshold.
the regime could now claim that prisoners were no longer tortured.
my knowledge of prison and torture amounted to no more than a few banned books and pamphlets i had read; some horrific stories i had heard on the underground radio broadcasts from outside iran; and plenty of rumors circulating within iran, which were substantiated during family gatherings by whispers about distant young male relatives who had emerged from jail but remained mute and lost, with deformed feet and their toenails having fallen off.
no wonder therefore that when i found myself in the komiteh-ye moshtarak-e zedd-e kharabkari (united anti-sabotage committee), a notorious detention center built under the shah’s regime on the site of the former central prison, my then young heart vacillated between pausing for breath and pounding heavily.
for since early 1978, having agreed that political prisons could be inspected by the red cross, the shah’s regime could no longer use its old torture devices to inflict overt torture or enduring pain on detainees.
rather, i was hunted down by the revolutionary public persecution of tehran, which ruled over the notorious evin prison.
in 1983, on the way to evin, i was driven through the piche toubeh (repentance curve), the name the agents who arrested me used to refer to the last curve of the road before reaching the prison.
in evin also, as piche toubeh suggested, prisoners were to either be killed or become repentant.
although i never repented nor was i killed in prison, at least not in the conventional sense of these terms, i trembled with a range of mixed emotions when after eight years, in 2004, during my return to iran to conduct my field research, i visited the unity committee.
hesitantly, i signed my name, fearful that the guard might check the records and realize that i had been a prisoner of both regimes.
in this journey through the labyrinth of the museum of information i was accompanied by a woman friend, ferdous, who was also a former political prisoner but interrogated and tortured in the unity committee.
the boys’ mockery reminded me of a more bitter parody, that of a dream that was once expressed by some of us during those elated moments of the victory  10  prologue  of the revolution of 1979 of the possibility of a day when all the shah’s prisons would be turned into museums.
now here we were, walking around this prison-museum, whose opening to the public felt like a slap in the face, considering that both ferdous and i had lived through the torture chambers of this regime.
i was dumbfounded by the cynical depiction in this prison-museum, not merely in its blunt silencing of some experiences while highlighting others but also by the way it continued to exercise violence in other prisons when turning this one into a museum.
through transforming this jail into a museum while maintaining and even expanding others, the regime at once ignored and reenacted the beheading of all those dreams of a brief moment in the “spring of freedom,” following the 1979 revolution, when the idea of closing prisons and opening them to the public as museums was envisioned.
1  in the footsteps of the giants  when i was arrested in 1977, i knew very little of the changes on the horizon that were soon to transform not only the iranian sociopolitical landscape but its penal system, and hence my own experiences of imprisonment.
here i was, now, in the united anti-sabotage committee, perhaps the most notorious detention center for political prisoners in iran at the time, faced with the interrogators whose names i had heard on the underâ�ground radio, who had acquired their fame through demonstrations of the utmost brutality against many legendary dissidents.
my pursuit of banned books and dissident views was enough to subject me to torture and imprisonment.
they painted the rooms, cleaned the hallways, fixed the toilets and bathrooms, gave us spoons for eating, and treated prisoners less harshly.
little did i know that even before my twoyear sentence was completed, i would be among those prisoners the shah was forced to free under the pressure of the revolutionary movement.
thus, when jimmy carter became president of the united states, he  in the footsteps of the giants  17  put pressure on the shah to alleviate political suppression, reduce censorship, and improve prison conditions.
these changes reconfigured the landscape of iranian society, as well as its detention centers and prisons.
initially, the regime pressed prisoners to sign letters of pardon to the shah requesting their release.
but by november 1978, people had turned into roaring rivers, demonstrating on the street and chanting for the freedom of political prisoners and making other demands.
these increasingly growing mass demonstrations compelled the shah to order the unconditional release of the majority of prisoners.
about four months before my sentence was over, my name appeared along with 999 other prisoners for release.
the government hoped that by freeing these prisoners, it could prevent the movement from becoming more radicalized.
people who awaited us in front of the jails were moving to the next stage, demanding not only the freedom of all political prisoners but also the collapse of the entire regime.
there were no people waiting outside the jail this time to carry prisoners on their shoulders or take them to the demonstration.
in 1978, i had to change my prison uniform to the only other piece of clothing i had, a wornout tunic, to avoid being raised on people’s shoulders, for i did not see my “trivial” imprisonment worthy of such attention.
although my release in late 1991 was also an attempt by the regime to resolve the problem of political prisoners, the plan to free prisoners in the 1990s was dependent on accepting the regime’s condition of release, which required signing a printed form known as enzejar nameh, a letter of repugnance or â�repudiation, or at  18  in the footsteps of the giants  least a mild version of it, which indicated the person denounced all dissident organizations and promised to avoid having any relationship with any kind of dissidence.
the fact that the release of prisoners in the1990s was not initiated by a revolutionary movement did not mean that there was no pressure both within and outside iran to urge the government toward this decision.
rather, it implied that, as in 1977, in the early 1990s the state was confident enough to negotiate its power over prisoners and press them to accept the condition of release.
but those prisoners who had given in to the condition of release and had signed papers had to report to the regime on a regular, first weekly, then biweekly, and finally monthly, basis.
his fear of the possibility of my rearrest and imprisonment was so grave for him that he preferred for us to live apart so i could be free and safe.
my body relived prison experiences whenever i felt that an authoritative force was challenging the limits of my will.
i remained highly sensitive to issues that had to do with prisoners’ sufferings, wherever or whoever they were.
they argued that the regime might be trying to trick us into leaving so they could shoot us on the pretext that we were trying to escape—this they claimed had been done in chile to a group of prisoners.
â�others insisted that we should refuse to leave until the regime accepted the release of all political prisoners—a small number of prisoners were not freed â�because they were considered more serious threats to the regime.
still  20  in the footsteps of the giants  others believed that we should immediately leave prison and join the fight for our friends’ freedom along with other revolutionary demands.
that entire evening, we continued discussing our options among ourselves—should we immediately leave, refuse to leave until everyone is set free, or choose another option—while the officials came in and out, baffled as to why we were not running out now that the regime was letting us leave without any conditions for release of the sort that kept so many prisoners jailed, sometimes for years after their time was over.
the guards’ and the prison officials’ constant pleas did not change our minds.
a couple of other inmates and i were assigned to remember and communicate to the people outside, upon our release, the names of those prisoners who were still jailed.
it was barely past nine in the morning when the gate was opened and about a hundred women prisoners were ushered through the gate to the outside, to the bosom of a crowd of strangers who acted like members of a single family.
even though i was not in prison uniform, i am not sure if it was my worn-out tunic or the simultaneous excitement and confusion in my eyes that exposed my status as a former political prisoner.
but in the half an hour that i searched for my family in the dense crowd that had gathered in front of ghasr, or palace, prison, i was hugged and greeted by numerous strangers, and  in the footsteps of the giants  21  finally a group of them asked me to ride with them to a demonstration at tehran university.
although the risk of violent death in a demonstration was looming over any participant’s head, torture and long-term imprisonment were becoming issues of the past.
since 1977, under pressure from president jimmy carter, the regime had allowed the red cross to inspect its political prisons.
in response to the rapidly growing protests, the regime had been forced to free the majority of its political prisoners.
the release of these prisoners was a defining moment in signaling the regime’s defeat and the subsequent giving in to people’s demands—a failed attempt in curtailing the protests.
my imprisonment had doubly terrified them because of the rumors about the commonality of rape, especially of young women, by the interrogators—a rumor that was circulated by the populace as much as by the regime.
during the nearly two years that i was in prison, my parents hid my arrest even from the closest members of the family, especially those on my father’s side.
they, however, did anything and everything humanly possible to get me out of jail—bore humiliation, withstood beatings, and finally eagerly joined the fight against the regime to release its political prisoners.
so eager was i to be part of the movement that i did not even have time to acknowledge their exhaustion from having spent an entire sleepless night, during which they did not know if we would ever emerge from jail—for we, the women prisoners, whose names were in newspapers as those to be released, had refused to leave that very night.
this refusal was meant to at once emphasize our demand for the release of all inmates and deny the regime a chance to send us out in the darkness of night—its tactic to prevent families from another gathering since every gathering was a chance for people to cry out their demand for the freedom of all political prisoners.
these remaining prisoners were freed in the next few months, the last ones by the people on the day of victory of the 1979 revolution.
little did i know in 1978 how short lived my  24  in the footsteps of the giants  seemingly permanent freedom would be and how soon those very prisons would be holding ten times as many people.
unlike in 1978, the release of nearly all political prisoners by 1992 was to signal the islamic republic regime’s confidence in having crushed its opponents and silenced the people.
in the footsteps of the giants  25  the massacre of political prisoners in the summer of 1988 marked a turning point in the history of political suppression in iran: about five thousand prisoners were executed in the course of two months, and a majority of these prisoners had already been sentenced to jail time or were about to be released.
the iranian state, in turn, used the attack as an opportunity to resolve its age-old problem of political prisoners by summarily killing thousands of individuals, none of whom were responsible for the attack.
the “era of reconstruction” was announced by president ali akbar hashemi â�rafsanjani, whose great hope to attract foreign investments faced the obstacle of the iranian regime’s human rights abuses, at the center of which was the question of political prisoners.
the release of the rest of the prisoners became the regime’s mission, which it undertook to accomplish with a spirit of confidence and necessity.
releasing prisoners was one of the most important steps that the regime had to take, albeit in an excruciatingly complex and violent process that was to avoid the fate of the shah’s regime.
the release of prisoners thus became the goal that the state pursued at nearly all costs, except that it was to appear not as an act of a defeated regime, like that of the shah, but as a gesture of strength and stability by a state that no longer felt threatened by its opponents.
in fact, the regime preferred the more colorful story in which its prisons had turned all its opponents to its supporters.
as the shah did in 1977, the islamic republic regime began by forcing prisoners to submit to the condition of their release, which required their renunciation of their past and any political and ideological inclinations and affiliations that diverged from those of the official discourse of the state.
the denouncing of their past and the recanting of beliefs had been the condition for prisoners’ release since the early 1980s.
an uneven battle, which had been going on between the prison officials and prisoners from the very early days of the islamic republic, was intensified, not in the quality of the recantation or renunciation but in its concentrated reinforcement of acquiring prisoners’ submission and therefore their release.
from the early 1980s to 1990s, the state-mandated denunciation of their past as the condition for prisoners’ release saw many changes, but the basic demand for renunciation remained until nearly the end, when the regime had to give in and free prisoners, though officially on a temporary basis.
this recantation-confession had to be made  in the footsteps of the giants  27  publiclyâ�—if not televised and broadcast on national television or on closed-circuit prison television, then at least carried out among a large crowd of prisoners in the huge prison halls, husseiniyeh.
but from 1985 on, after the severe crackdown on the main dissident organizations of the â�early 1980s and prisoners’ resistance, the condition of release became less daunting—signing a letter of repugnance.
f o ll o wing the massacre  of the summer of 1988, the regime underâ�  took the project of releasing prisoners by two means: pressure and negotiation.
first, the regime was aware that for many resistant prisoners, requesting a temporary release was meant to legitimize their imprisonment based on their dissident views, which the officials considered illegitimate.
aside from all the pressure, what was unbearable for these prisoners was the fact that upon their refusal to sign the form, it was the responsibility of their families to deliver them to prison.
the stories of the suffering of these prisoners and their families in this often long process leading to prisoners’ release are abundant.
soosan was one of the prisoners who had remained imprisoned beyond their sentence terms; in fact, her one-year sentence had ended in 1982, but because she refused to submit to the condition of her release, she was still in jail.
the prison officials did not allow her to attend the funeral.
in regard to those prisoners who rejected requesting temporary release, the regime turned to their families to convince them to press their children to comply.
by 1990, a large number of prisoners had signed the papers and were freed.
thus, when that morning in november 1991, the guard opened the door of my cell and called my name “for the hospital,” so she claimed, i left the cell unaware that this was to be my day to leave prison.
we had been taken to solitary confinement after most of our friends had gone through many rounds of being in and out of prison.
but at this point, the issue about the release of prisoners, at least the leftists, was mainly the question of who could afford to bail them out.
as we walked away from prison, my father’s fast pace and my mother’s words about forgetting all that i had left behind were indicative of their attempt to bring me back to the outside world.
in choosing the dissident cemetery as the point of my entry to this world, i was at once attesting to my attachment to my dead comrades and those still in prison, and promising to bear witness to their untimely deaths and unjust sufferings.
the water pressure in the shower in my sister’s second-floor apartment was so slight that i could not completely wash off the sweat from prison.
it was during this summer that my hamid and about five thousand other prisoners were executed.
the journalists did not perhaps stay long enough to see how night after night during those two months, meat trucks carried the bodies of hundreds of political prisoners and hastily dumped them into the ditches that were clumsily dug in the dark of night.
in prison, we had to listen to the loudspeakers, which were constantly broadcasting interminable prayers, religious verses, and crying voices confessing their sins and humiliating themselves.
the difference between me, the former political prisoner, and the outside world made more sense to me when a few months later, in the midst of the deafening noise of several different languages and dialects, compressed in the minibus, in the mixture of the sweaty odor of bodies and the smell of gasoline, i saw two eager eyes inviting recognition.
she was even paler than soudabeh ardavan, a former inmate, had portrayed her in her prison drawings.
pori was one of those women taken to a severe punishment ward set up by haji davoud, the chief of ghezel hesar prison at the time.
this already notorious prison, located in karadj, was bestowed with a new dimension of infamy because of this punishment ward, which haji â�davoud referred to as kārkhāneh-ye-ādam sāzi, the human-making factory, or dastgah-e-ādam sāzi, the human-making machine—prisoners shortened it and simply referred to it as dastgah.
the wooden walls were high enough to prevent prisoners from seeing each other while they were either sitting or lying down, which was their status all the time except for brief moments when they would be taken to the restroom, for a shower, or for interrogation.
all prisoners faced the wall; again, depending on the location of their spot, they faced either the wall of the hall, if their cell was adjacent to any four walls of the hall, or the wooden wall.
during the ten months that this torturous situation lasted, from 1983 to 1984, prisoners were forced to live, in their own words, in these j‘abehha (boxes), taboota (coffins), or ghabra (graves).
since the prisoners were blindfolded all the time, these blows, which so abruptly struck their bodies almost always unexpectedly, carved a huge hole in their minds within which the deadly bird of anticipation hovered, constantly flapping its wings.
from six in the morning until ten at night, prisoners had to squat on the floor, motionless and silent.
for several hours every day, which seemed eternity, they were forced to listen to the prison radio that broadcast religious lessons, prayers and qur’anic verses, or their former comrades’ confessions.
even the softest of the lashes by these former friends, who were now playing extra hands of evil, felt harsher on prisoners’ bodies; these lashes sank deeper into their memories and burned an irreducible, enduring register of pain in their minds and bodies.
trust was shattered; it survived in an abstract language, which was already eluding prisoners.
those who had gone through this calamitous situation, be it the collaborators or the resistant prisoners, were marked by its injuries, which they carried with them to the wards where they were returned, and perhaps later, everywhere they went.
but if these prisoners were still capable of functioning, albeit in a deadly and destructive manner, there were others who appeared so oblivious to their existence that even death could pass them by without noticing them or being noticed by them.
although the corpse of a stagnant life was still  42  in the footsteps of the giants  clinging to its vegetative being like a parasite, the prisoner had already departed this world.
but a small number of prisoners came out of this human-making factory with their subjectivity still somewhat intact.
they suggested that since we had not been to the dastgah and had not experienced what they had, we undertook radical resistance to prison regulations in an adventurous manner without realizing that if we were put under a similar torturous condition, many of us would end up betraying our friends, as most of their friends had  in the footsteps of the giants  43  betrayed them.
many prisoners perceived these withdrawn inmates as cynical, as political pessimists, if not just broken.
those who had chosen to withdraw from others, in turn, construed other prisoners as politically naïve or irresponsible adventurers.
some of these prisoners would realize that they had superimposed their own experiences and emotions onto the views of their political affiliations only after they were released.
the division increased, for gradually even those who had distanced themselves from the rest of the prisoners but were close to one another began to distance themselves from each other.
despite her self-isolated, thus double, imprisonment, pori still refused to give in to the regime’s condition to sign the letter of repugnance for her release.
her words made me realize how strong the bond of pain was between those of us who had experienced those years of imprisonment and the challenges of surviving in the world so estranged  44  in the footsteps of the giants  from it.
the “we” of which she was speaking was a reference to all of us former political prisoners, with whom she now seemed to feel a deeper connection than to her own family members.
this was a kinship felt not only by pori but by nearly all of us who had survived imprisonment without becoming collaborators or without having completely lost ourselves in the process.
male prisoners seemed to have chosen a single metaphor, taboota, to refer to the place within which they were forced to live for months.
notwithstanding its initial coinage, it appeared to have resonated with nearly all prisoners, for after hearingâ€it from men, women often spoke of those cells either as ghabra or taboota.
perhaps no other name could have conveyed as accurately what the place was to achieve, the annihilation of prisoners’ old selves.
most of the names appropriated by the women were initially used in some form by prison officials.
others referred to it as gharantineh, or quarantine, also the name haji davoud and other prison officials used for the large hall in this ward  in the footsteps of the giants  45  where prisoners were often taken for different periods for further punishment.
as the name suggests, the place was to temporarily segregateâ€the “contagiously dangerous” elements from the rest of the prisoners, as is theâ€purpose of quarantine in epidemics, until they were either cured or dead.
for instance, was the term taboota, which nowadays has been adopted more broadly by most former prisoners and even the larger public to allude to the presumably unisex experience of prisoners in those punishment wards, simply coined by men based on the physical resemblance between those wooden cells and coffins?
yet this argument rests on two assumptions: on a stereotypical view of men as more practical minded than women and a reductive notion of death that does not take the complexities of prisoners’ experiences and views of life and death into account.
but in a sense, haji davoud’s “human-making machine,” a term known by both male and female prisoners, was intended to produce his desirable humans through the destruction of prisoners’ old selves.
for example, ascribing names like “coffins” or “graves” could implicitly articulate and reinforce prisoners’ sense of death as an inevitable “destiny-ation” of haji’s project.
male prisoners used the word zadan, beating, to refer to execution.
yet prison experience proves how one might live such a stagnant, bloodless life that no thunder or hurricane could affect it.
for example, vahed-e 1 simply refers to the ward in which these wooden cells  in the footsteps of the giants  47  were set up; dastgah was haji’s word, only shortened, and takhta alluded to a small space nearly the size of a small single bed between the wooden walls where the prisoner could sleep.
it was not rare to hear of the inadequacy of female inmates’ knowledge and experience of political activism and imprisonment.
of course, the number of men who had experienced imprisonment under both the shah and the islamic republic far exceeded that of women.
words were not casually utilized in prison; particularly under the islamic republic, words could easily save someone or lead to someone’s death.
it is impossible to provide an intact image of what happened in prison.
i am talking about it, as others have, so i do not forget and yet to free myself from its haunting, imprisoning power.
how might i avoid essentializing the particular experiences of political prisoners in a specific moment of â�iranian history yet also avoid reducing the experience to the act of crueltyâ€ofâ€an islamic state, as has often been done by the west and even many iranians?
writing about prison is not an easy task.
as i began  50  in the footsteps of the giants  thinking about writing, the ghostly presence of those prisoners who had gone mad became overwhelming.
the debate about the mass executions of 1988 has always been very rancorous among iranian political prisoners and activists.
they argued over whether or not the prisoners knew that they were being taken for execution in the last moments of their lives and if having the knowledge would have made any difference in the way they answered the few questions in the court that determined their life or death.
many of those male prisoners who had accepted the regime’s conditions, and therefore had escaped their “destiny,” attempted to convince others that the knowledge of imminent death would have changed the strategies of the condemned.
on the other hand, the women who had lived and gone through long periods of torture in prison, both physically and psychologically, and survived the loss of their loved ones, insisted that their resistance and refusal to submit were not merely emotional, irrational, womanly behavior or a stubborn or sentimentally heroic gesture, as suggested by some male political prisoners and sometimes even their own families.
this assumption appeared perplexing when accepted by prisoners who had themselves so often experienced blurry boundaries.
many political prisoners had faced interrogation and torture, wherein silence defined the essence of one’s existence.
prisons are to isolate the unfit, inappropriate, and nonconformist other from the rest of society.
yet within the interior, isolated world of prison, a plurality of otherness is brought into existence and a simulated hierarchical society is created.
the interrogators’ relationships to the prisoners vary depending on the quality and level of the prisoners’ involvement in the opposition movement, their position in their organizations, resistance to torture, gender, class and ethnic identities, and even physical appearance.
the hierarchy, however, is neither limited to the prison officials nor to these variables.
prisoners draw many other boundaries that erect invisible walls between them within the prison walls.
executed prisoners belong to a terrain that we cannot enter unless we give up on our lives or perhaps our sanity.
a year and half after she was released, two months after my departure, mahvash, a physician who was imprisoned for nine years, committed suicide.
i read what i had written a few years ago about my experience of emerging from prison and compared it to what i was writing now.
the ward was so crowded that i thought she would be crushed under the feet of other prisoners, who i was not sure had seen this fragile body.
even her barking wasn’t heard since prisoners were talking to one another and the ward was filled with noise.
but my eyes were fixed on her as she crawled, barked, and begged sister bakhtiyari to allow her to stop barking and crawling—“sister” was the title by which prisoners were to refer to the women guards; all the male prison personnel, from guards to interrogators, were to be called “brother.” refusing to refer to the prison officials as sisters and brothers was itself another reason for punishment.
55  56  roya  roya was still barking and asking sister bakhtiyari, a notorious guard in gohar dasht prison, to let her stop.
torture and humiliation in prison are brutal hunters waiting for an opportunity to seize their prey; our nights could simply turn into reality the day after, sometimes in the same night.
e how many times have i heard this in prison, that we were nothing but brainless dogs?
under both the shah and the islamic republic, the torturers forced the prisoners to play different animals’ roles, especially dogs and donkeys.
one of the torturers’ hobbies was getting a ride from these prisoner-donkeys.
it was 1984 when seventy prisoners, i among them, were taken from evin prison in tehran to ghezel hesar in karadj.
we had to listen to the confessions of prisoners, many of them our close friends.
these were prisoners who had gone through haji davoud’s dastgah and had agreed to collaborate with the interrogators.
the prison officials threatened that they were taking us to jāei keh arab ney andākht, a place where a legendary arab had dropped his ney, a flutelike musical instrument.
survival in prison—surviving the madness, suicide, and collaboration—requires holding on to hope when it seems so remote and so unreachable.
against this hope, interrogators try to create an atmosphere of the eternity of horror so that the prisoner loses sight of any possible ending.
the joy of the end is, however, often tarnished by the terrifying question in the prisoner’s mind, what if the end had not come?
a woman who was in jail during the 1980s explains these precarious moments between her own state of despair and the end of torture: “half consciously, i thought if these interrogators were not such idiots, they would have known the state of mind of a prisoner in each moment.
probably those prisoners who were whipping their own friends, or participating in their execution had been caught in the state that i was last night.” all of a sudden, our anticipation for the torments that were awaiting us in the dastgah came to an end, though our pondering of the “what if?” question continued.
we were not taken to “nowhere” since the whole process stopped as a result of prisoners’ families’ pressure and the conflict within the regime over this system of punishment.
entering that ward was one of my most grotesque experiences in prison.
the cells were also separated from the main hall by similar black metal bars, which made them appear more like cages than the rooms or cells in which i had lived in different wards in evin prison.
while we were jammed in this zir-e hasht, where the warden’s office was located, waiting to be assigned our cells and to be added to the list of prisoners in this ward, women on the other side gathered behind bars; some even climbed the bars to watch us.
the head of the ward was a former leftist, homa kalhor, who used to be a close friend of one of our fellow prisoners.
those prisoners who had been in jail longer than i had begun to recognize faces among the ones on the other side, some of whom had clearly become collaborators.
melancholic evenings and madness it was in this bizarre place that i saw roya for the first time, on one of those evenings when the prisoners were pouring out of their cells like lava from a volcano.
in prison, evenings are the worst part of the day.
evenings in prison are filled with worries, fright, pain, and boredom.
these were concerns that deprived prisoners of sleep.
the trauma of evening extends beyond prison so that it affects prisoners’ feelings about this time of the day for years to come.
nobody knew exactly what had happened to her in prison.
all we knew was that she was kept in solitude, in the notorious gohar dasht prison, for a long time.
e  64  roya  prisoners’ desperate and vain attempts to move to the corners to avoid beatings are reinforced and taken advantage of by the torturers who surround and trap them, as hunters catch their prey.
the stark contrast between our modern perceptions, which rely so heavily on precision, clear distinctions, and dichotomies, and the world of delirium in which the boundaries and borders are blurred, is further accentuated in prisoners’ remembrance of their traumatic experiences in which memory and reality are fused.
it was this uncertainty with which a prisoner had to come to terms and live.
failing to do so could result in being imprisoned in the torturous moment, in one’s inability to move out of it, which would mean to lose the capacity to create and live with history, memory, and imagination.
a frozen present, like that in which roya was imprisoned, blocks the possibility of imagination and precludes the possibility of differentiating between reality and illusion.
of this destruction of all distinctions in the face of the pain of torture, a former iranian woman prisoner, also in the 1980s, remembers: “counting, cursing, or imagining my loved ones’ faces no longer had any effect in reducing the pain of the lashes.
roya herself seemed to perceive her situation as a consequence of torture, for in her conversation with her former high school teacher, aki, the only prisoner she ever talked to while in ghezel hesar, she suggested that “they [apparently the guards] melted my brain so that there remained nothing in it except water.” this conversation with aki occurred on one of roya’s lucky days on which her loved ones had come.
despite their theatricality, both of us, the resistant prisoners and roya, considered these ceremonious acts to be deadly serious.
an essential element of resistance in prison is the refusal to let torturers take over one’s life and turn its every moment into another source of pain.
70  roya  â�prisoners insist on their humanity and struggle to assert themselves as social and creative beings.
prisoners gather all their personal and sociocultural resources to engender an atmosphere of joy, creativity, and rejuvenation, whereas the torturers target any potential sign of happiness and imaginative creation of lively moments among prisoners.
no wonder that in all these years in jail, both under the shah and in this regime, i realized that prison officials treated any indication of sympathy for someone and any refusal to comply with authority as a criminal and rebellious act, for which prisoners deserved to be severely punished.
in fact, the event leading to the establishment of haji davoud’s dastgah was a minor event undertaken by a group of prisoners who simply cared about their integrity and about one another.
in ghezel hesar, prisoners were forced to attend regular public confessions given by other prisoners.
the goal of these confessions was twofold: to humiliate both the speaker and the listener while annulling prisoners’ trust and confidence in themselves and one another; and to give the regime another opportunity for demonizing any opposition organization.
more important, haji davoud claimed that he was concerned about the immorality of his prisoners, who, he suggested, were a deadly danger to society.
he accused the leftist prisoners of being nonbelievers—sex-crazy, corrupt individuals who lacked any values or morals, who shared their women with one another.
listening to these confessions was so emotionally disturbing for other prisoners that they preferred to resist attending them and hence be seriously punished than to suffer the pain of bearing witness to these hu-  roya  71  miliating recantations—an attempt that wasn’t always successful since they were usually dragged to the confessions.
on a normal day in 1983, a day not worse than any other day in prison, a guard came to one of the women’s wards and announced a new session of confessions for that day.
she also ordered the group responsible for the day’s cleaning to take carpets to the hall where all the prisoners would sit and watch the show.
cleaning the ward was usually a voluntary job organized by prisoners in our ward.
but now, this newly imposed duty created conflicts and various reactions among prisoners: some believed that fighting against haji davoud’s order would be too dangerous since his reputation for punishment was well established.
haji davoud’s blood rushed to his face as he heard the prisoners’ response.
a new phase of anticipation began, and until late in the evening when haji was through with his show for the day and came to the ward, prisoners experienced a life of barzakh again.
the beating started, and before long, some of the prisoners were wrapped in blankets and rolled over like a ball from one guard to another while being beaten brutally and violently.
in contrast to claims that suggest we cannot feel others’ pain, my experience is that watching other prisoners being tortured is extremely unbearable.
what haji davoud labeled as a preplanned rebellion was a natural reaction initiated by one of the prisoners who, unable to continue watching her friends’ suffering, protested the beating by simply saying, “don’t beat.” her words were contagious, mainly because the feeling was commonly shared.
other prisoners also began saying, “don’t beat,” and in a few minutes all the prisoners in the hall were repeating, “don’t beat.” haji davoud found this incredible.
“how could you dare to protest under my authority and in my prison?
i t is this dynamic  of power relations that was exemplified in prison-  ers’ untiring attempts to preserve their connection to rituals, tradition, innovation, and creativity as part of their humanness, to keep their sense of empathy alive, qualities that were the object of suppression under the regimes of surveillance.
trying to justify our unspoken but ongoing struggle with the prison officials over such “trivial things” as our new year tradition would be impossible unless it is explained and seen in its symbolic and temporary contexts.
the idea that if you haven’t cleaned your place, the whole year you will be a mess was considered a funny idea and somehow superstitious for many of us modern intellectuals before we were imprisoned.
however, once in prison, keeping this tradi-  roya  73  tion alive was a determining element in feeling connected to our larger community and its social life.
both the prisoners and the guards were sharing the same symbolic culture according to which plants personified growth and vitality, depending on the context in which they were being metaphorically used.
designing these plants in such shapes, instead of their usual form, was to communicate another stratum of this symbolic representation that was more overtly political, although in prison every action taken was extremely political.
freedom, that illicit word in prison, was invisibly yet clearly inscribed in the wings of our plant-bird who could fly in the blue sky of our free imagination to release us from the imprisonment of our spirit.
for the regime it indicated the prisoners’ blunt proposition that winter would be over and spring with its generous smile would embrace every tortured body.
“you are prisoners, and you are supposed to be in isolation.
don’t stick your nose in something that does not have anything to do with you, and don’t assume that we are stupid and don’t understand what you mean when you say the freezing cold winter is leaving and it has to give way to spring with its beautiful, generous, sunny smile.” these are almost the exact words of meisam, the head of the ghezel hesar ward in 1985, in response to the prisoners’ complaints that their letters were not sent to their families.
the irony of the censorship illustrated itself in the creativity of the prisoners in exploring new ways to resist, new symbols to employ to convey their message, and innovative tools to communicate their desire and emotions.
the embodiment of the deeper meaning of every action and reaction in prison was what made life in prison so intensely stressful and exhausting, immersed in pain and grief yet so saturated with marvels and exploration.
it is in this light that our effort to celebrate new year was considered so significant both for us and for the prison’s officials.
donya, the woman who sat in the entrance section of the ward in ghezel hesar, motionless and totally withdrawn from the rest of the prisoners, seemed to have died before death.
in the ward, our efforts concentrated on creating a life as cultural, social beings while accepting the reality of our situation in prison.
it all started when some of the prisoners tried to help her take a shower after weeks and weeks of sitting and lying down in her own dirt and blood.
she sat in the hall on the side of the entrance to the yard, in front of the room where two little children and their imprisoned mothers were living— children were a conflicting aspect of prison life, simultaneously a source of joy and pain.
later the regime made it mandatory for these children to be sent out of the prison.
before taking residence in the corner of the hall, fozi was assigned to one of the rooms occupied mostly by other prisoners who had been arrested for their affiliation with the iranian militant organization â�mojahedin-khalgh-e iran, called mojahedin by resistant prisoners, and monafeghin, or hypocrites, by the regime and collaborators.
watching her rapid changes, those prisoners who had known her since her first arrest were more shocked than the rest of us.
she gave birth to her daughter in prison and pretended to be a devoted collaborator.
earning haji davoud’s trust by giving information about the members of other organizations in prison, she became the head of the ward.
still connected to mojahedin, she sent them information about prison, thus actually working as a double agent for the regime and her own organization.
in 1984, through the information given under torture by one of the members involved, an underground network of the mojahedin organization in prison was discovered.
every day these mojahed prisoners were obliged to read and memorize islamic texts or political propaganda and to listen to the prison radio’s special programs for several hours.
as though the prisoners were in school, the interrogators played the role of their teachers and would test them on these materials, except that here a failing grade would be punished by severe torture and humiliation.
for prisoners, collaborators embody lost souls who remind them of their own potential moral degeneration, tempting them to submit and find relief.
for the prison officials, the collaborators are part of the machinery of the laboratory with which they improve the effectiveness of their methods.
the intense humiliation and shame induce the perception of themselves as so unworthy and outcast that they must continuously deny any connection between themselves and other prisoners.
this increased existential gulf between the collaborators and other prisoners undermines the legitimacy of their suffering in the eyes of other prisoners and blinds them to the fact that the collaborators are also subjects of these technologies of power.
this terrifying image of a collapsed or imploded self and its monstrous shadow menacing other prisoners reminds them of their own possible fate, alienates them from these monstrous others, and excludes the collaborators from their community as morally flawed.
she was already disliked by the leftists and other prisoners not allied to the mojahedin, and now she was hated by her own friends, among whom she found her worst enemies.
she, a nurse whose job was taking care of injured and sick people, ended up in prison and in haji’s â�dastgah, where she inflicted pain on her own friends’ bodies and was herself also beaten by her friends.
when she was thrown into the narrow hall of the first floor of the two-story ward 246, into the midst of hundreds of prisoners who were walking hastily as though headed somewhere, i heard the whisper among mojahedin prisoners, “oh look, she is fozi, that awful monster, the evil.” fozi was already in action before anyone had the chance to react to her arrival.
there were others who argued that even if  fozi  85  mad, she deserved her misery, for she was paying for the horrible harm she had inflicted on other prisoners.
obviously, the prison officials were entertained by this situation, which had disturbed the whole ward.
prison is the stage on which these different scenarios and their characters are enacted, albeit in a wide continuum.
one of the joyous moments that the most resistant prisoners experienced occurred when their torturers got furious at them, called them names, and beat them more severely; it meant that they had accomplished the goal of their resistance.
one  of  these  inspiring  st o ries  for resistant prisoners was  about reza’s resilience.
dissidents like reza, or many of the rest of us in prison, had never been engaged in, nor did we believe in participating in, any armed struggle against the regime at that historical moment.
the main goal of this torture was therefore not really to obtain information, though torture is never only about obtaining information, but even more so here it was to force prisoners into humiliation, self-annihilation through forced confessions and recantations.
it was after we watched, on this new tv, the remaining male prisoners marching in the streets of tehran, announcing to the world that “evin is a university, not a prison.
there is no execution or torture in iran’s prisons” and that “we are devoted muslims redeemed from our sinful past.” they sent messages to us: “stop fighting.
there is no point in fighting; they will win.” it was after those men and women who accepted the regime’s condition were released that few of us remained imprisoned.
in the evenings, if we still felt like talking, we would sit and recall those early years of our imprisonment, so far and yet so near, when we did not have any space to even sit in the ward.
the former prisoners’ handwriting on the walls was the only trace left from those thousands whose friendship, laughter, whispers, screams, pain, fear, madness, and even betrayal once filled these jails with life and death.
soon we were mixed with common criminals, for the first time in the recent history of the political prisons, where we would see young teenagers blossoming in prison only to be raped byâ€the interrogators.
yet later, in prison, my presence pushed soosan, a woman inmate, to take a more outspoken stand that may have caused harsher treatment by her interrogator.
during my interrogation soon after my arrest in 1983, rahim, my main interrogator, was trying to break my resistance by bragging about his merciless treatment of those prisoners who had not given in and had  106  fozi  thus died, either under torture or by execution—though he could not hide the rage and disappointment lurking under his apparently victorious tone.
nearly two years after her imprisonment, she was still refusing to publicly recant and renounce her past.
both blindfolded, we sat awkwardly in the interrogation room while rahim began his show first by asking soosan whether or not she had changed her mind about mosahebeh—an interview, but in fact, it meant public recantation—and was now willing to appear in the husseiniyeh, the large hall in prison that was mainly used for prisoners’ public recantation, to utter her renunciation of all the dissident organizations.
but then rahim began going on and on, now lecturing me about how soosan’s case proved that those prisoners who pride themselves on maintaining their stand against the regime and act courageously among themselves are in fact cowards when facing the interrogators; that they do not dare to speak and stand up for their beliefs because their beliefs are based on fake materialistic ideals, which cannot endure the power of islam and the brothers’ lashes.
each prisoner had to wait to be beaten on her head while she pronounced her name.
i had supposedly made a logical decision, along with many other prisoners who also refused to sign the renunciation form, not to spend my energy on small fights with the guards.
considering the constant pressure the regime imposed on us, we figured that it was essential for us not to constantly distract ourselves by engaging prison officials over insignificant issues they intentionally threw our way.
i knew prisoners who, unable to endure more pressure, decided to sign the renunciation form.
some prisoners ignored the pain of their souls, as if nothing had happened, while others hated themselves, and still others turned the pain into rage toward the regime.
this attitude, i recognize now, is a way of living the traumatic experiences of my childhood and prison, each time anew.
how many moral and ethical dilemmas have led me to perpetually ask myself a similar question: “what should i do?”  e the air was thick with the perturbed sighs of prisoners who with their eyes wide open witnessed fozi’s inappropriate behavior—she had taken her pants off in the room she shared with more than forty other women and was inserting a bar of soap into her vagina.
many of the prisoners looked frightened and agitated, while fozi showed no sign of awareness of others’ presence.
lying down naked in her bed, touching herself in front of everyone, she was undermining an extremely sensitive aspect of the iranian political prisoners’ unwritten moral and social code of conduct.
her madness was undoubtedly confirmed, for no political prisoner in her right mind could ever have done what she was doing, getting naked in front of others, but even worse, touching herself.
from the prisoners’ perspective, she had violated all the social rules of propriety that made us political subjects.
this new status, however, did not grant fozi the same sympathy from other prisoners as it had for roya, the young woman in ghezel hesar who relived her punishment of being forced to crawl and bark like a dog and host imaginary guests.
anything that the leftists touched with their wet hands was rendered polluted, according to prison officials and many collaborators, including fozi, before she was insane.
ward 325 was one of the strangest wards during my years in prison.
we loved the fact that we could stay in the yard most of the day, and that in the evenings we could hear children’s shouts and laughter from luna park, the closest children’s park to evin prison.
the mojahedin outside prison did not have to take the risk of punishing her betrayal by killing her.
when her name was announced on the loudspeaker of the prison ward, she was walking in the yard with her friends.
her feet were still imprisoned in this place, while her soul had already stepped out, and in so doing, she had lost the means of utterance.
was she aware of her imprisonment in evin prison?
even if she was, what difference could it make when the whole world was a prison for her from which she was interminably trying to escape?
stolen pills, which she would take at night, were not enough for her imprisoned body to fly out of this alien world.
some prisoners perceived her behavior as an indica-  kobra  123  tion of her need for attention, thus insincere and pretentious.
some of my fellow prisoners believed that, despite her alienation and depression, she was still more in touch with life than death so that she could not seriously hurt herself.
she kept attempting futile suicides, and we devotedly “saved” her until the prison officials  124  kobra  considered her abnormal and ill enough to interfere in her anguished life.
years later, however, when i was released from my second imprisonment, my mother-in-law looked me in the eye and asked, “how could you go to prison with hamid and come back without him?
for she herself had lost the two most significant loves of her life, her son, hamid, and her husband, my father-in-law, who had had a stroke and died while we were still in prison.
all those loved ones i had lost while in prison, always belated, always after the fact, always months, if not years, after all the mourning processions had passed.
i could have ignored the political massacre of 1988 that had cost the lives of thousands of political prisoners, including hamid, and told him that he had died to refuse submitting to a bare life.
the truth was that hamid and i, and many other prisoners, believed that to surrender to the regime and to denounce our past, regardless of what we presently believed, was to allow ourselves to be reduced to a merely organic life, a life in which one’s survival comes at the cost of one’s subjectivity.
it seemed that the image of this vulnerable woman did not match that of a resistant political prisoner.
it was not merely the loss of a person, or a romantic love per se, but all that i had believed and lived for my entire life, especially during my years in prison, that love is the cure and the savior, the power and the might that overcomes everything against all odds; this belief that had helped me survive all obstacles, even the absurdity of my own survival, was now being crushed in front of me.
paradoxically, just three years before at the iranian women’s studies foundation conference, i had â�argued,  130  kobra  in â�response to a former political prisoner who used the metaphor of animals in a zoo to speak of our experience of imprisonment as being victims of the regime’s atrocities, that we were neither animals nor helpless victims but the subjects of our own will.
we had lived together only to celebrate our first anniversary outside prison.
for every other anniversary after the first year, until his execution, we were separated from one another, while both imprisoned.
—shamlu, “mahi”  in one of his letters, which passed the prison inspectors’ filtering, he wrote me: “from you i learned how to apprehend being together while living separated,” and i wrote him back: “every day of living with you and now thinking about you has been the source of inspiration, strength, and new ways of loving.
you were always like that, and i loved you for it.” in 1983, ten months after our imprisonment, i was called for interrogation.
three years later, when i was released, i met a former male prisoner who was in the same ward with hamid at the time of the mass execution.
her conversion from islam to marxism made her perceived by both collaborators and the prison officials as even worse than those nonreligious prisoners whose families were not religious.
she was almost disowned by her family for becoming a leftist, and her imprisonment worsened this distance between her and her family.
in addition to the pressure from the prison officials, the guards, and collaborators, she was also almost deserted by her family since she refused to submit to the regime’s conditions for her release as her parents demanded.
kobra was arrested in 1981, when the wards were extremely overcrowded and prisoners of different ages, organizations, and tendencies were squeezed into the same ward.
for resistant prisoners, the struggle against this isolation was a very challenging yet essential task.
from 1981 to 1985, the collaborators were dominating prisons and creating an extremely unbearable situation for other prisoners by scrutinizing every move they made and reporting them to the interrogators, thus putting the prisoners under more severe torture and heavier sentences.
the regime’s brutality along with these difficult conditions in the wards led many of the prisoners toward a tactical retreat.
these prisoners would pretend that they had converted to islam and that they were no longer activists.
at the time, among about five hundred prisoners, i was the second person in the entire ward who did not pray and took a direct stand against the regime.
these were children who were either born in prison or arrested along with their mothers and had no one outside who could take care of them.
as time passed, those prisoners who had survived execution and madness, at least for the time being, learned more about themselves, their strengths, and new methods of resistance.
the antagonistic relationship between the adamant prisoners and the collaborators eventually led to increasing divergence among prisoners.
this encouraged the prison officials to begin their policy of segregating the resistant prisoners from the rest.
as a result, the tension in the wards was relatively reduced, since the guards were unable to scrutinize the prisoners’ lives as closely as the collaborators did.
having thus lost their importance in prison, most of the collaborators were released.
despite the changes that occurred in the wards, the conflict in prison remained intense.
the prisoners were demanding better treatment while refusing to accept the regime’s imposing rules in prison and the conditions for their release.
these actions, which often included hunger strikes, refusal to attend forced public recantations, or other occasions that mandated prisoners’ presence, were severely suppressed, and prisoners were often brutally punished.
the defeats and the extreme pressure that followed incited many prisoners toward less direct actions and opinions.
after experiences like the dastgah in ghezel hesar, from which very few prisoners emerged as noncollaborators or sane individuals, it became even clearer that one’s resistance under torture in the early stages of one’s arrest did not necessarily guarantee its continuation under more extreme and prolonged conditions of hardship.
this collaboration sometimes cost prisoners’ trust of one another, the lack of which influenced every aspect of their lives and relationships to one another.
from 1984 until 1986, several movements by women prisoners were crushed, and many of the women agreed to the regime’s conditions to recant and be released.
as the government was establishing its technologies of power more solidly by suppressing nearly all the opposition groups outside and inside prison, her analysis of the situation was becoming more radicalized.
she had a difficult time sleeping in a room with other prisoners, many of whom would speak, scream, or make other noises while asleep, especially during and after the summer of 1988.
sleep deprivation, the prison’s constant pressure, and her failure to face reality pushed her further into withdrawing into herself.
people are coming to open the prison gate, and you are sitting here so passively?” confused and surprised, we tried to calm her down, while the guards closed the door, taunting and laughing at her hysterically.
yet kobra looked deadly serious and enthusiastic about the revolution behind prison walls, as she imagined it.
you are ignoring them, since you have been so afraid for so long that you prefer to stay passive and imprisoned.
these actions had given prison officials an excuse to beat her up.
finally, she was driven to the point where her insanity was proved to prison officials, and she was hospitalized.
in 1989, when she was totally out of control, they delivered her to her family, who sent her to a mental hospital, from one type of imprisonment to another.
she had been given a job at a private company where a few other former inmates were also working for a previously leftist political prisoner under the shah’s regime.
while in prison, our adequacy in living up to these standards was constantly questioned.
ironically, this tendency became a driving force pushing her further from the mainstream and hence toward further imprisonment within the boundaries of these norms.
every memory she gathered of her insane behavior in prison pushed her one more step toward her “ultimate fall from existence.” the mirror she had held in her mind was shattered when she saw how far she had wandered from her ideal image of herself.
those of us who had known kobra’s  144  kobra  earlier attitude toward social and sexual propriety and heard of her behavior during her insanity, when she undressed in front of the guards and acted in sexually suggestive ways, taboo behavior among political prisoners, the enormity of her humiliation may be deciphered, and hence her suicide.
a beautiful, gentle, delicate woman, she had a graceful, feminine appearance, almost too delicate for prison.
however, like pori, she also gradually lost trust in other prisoners and joined those few prisoners who had gone through the â�dastgah; for she, too, had seen her friends’ betrayal, and her faith in others had faded away.
for a while, they seemed inseparable, but in the worst possible time of crisis in the prison, the summer of 1988, their friendship seemed to have fallen apart.
most prisoners believed that it was sanaz who was ignoring marjan, and  kobra  145  that marjan was still pursuing her friendship without a positive response.
while the attack brought nothing for the mojahedin but a humiliating defeat, for the islamic republic it provided an excuse and opportunity to solve the persistent problem of political prisoners, an opportunity that the iranian government had impatiently anticipated.
in fact, one of the prison’s high officials bluntly told us that they got rid of the problem itself instead of wasting their time waiting to resolve it otherwise.
he was referring to the execution of thousands of prisoners following the attack.
for the islamic republic, political prisoners were the embodiment of a complex dilemma, since their very existence was a challenge to the totalized divine system the regime claimed to represent.
yet neither infliction of pain on prisoners’ bodies nor theological persuasion was effective in returning some prisoners’ souls to god, which for the regime really meant to acquire support for the islamic republic.
the majority of prisoners who were affiliated with the mojahedin organization were immediately called from the wards, summarily tried, and executed in large groups.
regimes of torture were intensified against the rest of us, assuring either acquiescence or execution for the vast majority of iran’s remaining  146  kobra  population of political prisoners.
as the prisoners were ushered into court in random sequence, each of us had to contemplate the consequences of our individual and collective decision to convert or to embrace death.
a fellow prisoner, monireh baradarn, who initially wrote under the pen name m. raha, poses the following questions in regard to marjan: “had she believed the horrifying events that we could not get ourselves to believe?
in the opening of the gate to the yard, one of the few pleasurable sounds in jail, marjan’s ears heard the echo of gunfire that killed prisoners.
she became a prisoner of horror; she stood at the door all day long, with her ear attached to it, and anxiously awaited her turn to be taken as the next prey of the lashes.
many of the prisoners were unsuccessful in this effort and either submitted to the regime’s conditions or slipped into the worlds of madness or death.
i am not sure, for in iranian prisons (unlike abu ghraib or guantanomo) dogs were not included among the torture techniques.
escape from prison, which in reality is so incredibly unlikely, constantly emanates in prisoners’ dreams, especially while under torture.
with the wounded feet that are chained within the multiple boundaries of prison, one runs up hills, climbs mountains and swims in the ocean, and breaks the thick walls and doors wherever the wings of dreams fly.
they are essential elements that help prisoners survive the dread of torture.
what seems clear to me, however, is that when hope vanishes, for a prisoner left with a ravished body and soul, it vanishes both from her dreams and reality.
during those nearly two years of my imprisonment, my family’s remarks were limited to some general comments about his situation: “he is calm and back in the village.
the way that everyone seems to have played a part in drawing yousuf to his final destination reminds me of the massacre of political prisoners in the summer of 1988.
the prison officials pursued a policy of having everyone’s hands in the system covered with prisoners’ blood.
this collective involvement of all the prison personnel in the process of torture, execution, and getting rid of their dead bodies was rationalized as a safety valve for those who were the main agents of this crime.
we overheard this from the guards, who were talking about a time when one of them had tried to get out of the task of shooting prisoners or carrying their corpses, and the response from the higher-ranking officers had been that nobody’s hands were to remain clean.
the people’s uprising had reached a critical point so that its strong tides were shaking the prison walls.
with censorship lifted from the newspapers, we learned that the release of political prisoners was a central slogan of the demonstrations.
then came that evening in 1978, only three months before the revolution, when my name was announced along with those of a majority of other prisoners, on the list of those to be released.
he could not refuse doing what i had asked him since i had come from prison —how much this annoyed me!
yousuf’s brother was sitting there asking me about prison, and i was imagining his hands among others holding yousuf over the bridge for that indefinite time.
i had left my friends behind in prison, witnessed people exposing their chests to the shah’s armed soldiers, and had come home to be asked about my heroism while i felt so helpless in understanding yousuf.
it was frightening for me to admit how yousuf’s experience in being dropped from the bridge and his loss of sanity in the face of death resembled the experiences of many prisoners who were taken for faked executions.
getting information from a prisoner was likened to the procedure of removing a tumor from a person’s body.
as agents of the secret police, our captors who drove hamid and me to evin prison addressed one another as brothers.
the voices of those prisoners who, while under torture, would beg the brothers to stop the beatings cried out the paradox of this strange, superficial relation between the torture and the language used by the torturer.
from the first day, a battle began between those prisoners who resisted addressing the prison officials and the interrogators as their sisters and brothers and the prison officials who fought to force them to utter these words, while they called prisoners names and dirty words, making their reference to them in familial terms even more bizarre.
this constant conflict over the way things and people were to be named overshadowed every aspect of life in prison and illustrated the significance of how relationships were articulated and represented.
the prison under the islamic republic was daneshgah, or a university, and the wards were called āmouzeshgah, the place for education, or āsāyeshgāh, the place to rest.
the pain inflicted on prisoners was not torture, but tazir or hadd, islamic terms for regulatory punishment.
the fight extended even to our everyday language where the prison officials would insist on referring to our daily chores in prison as “housekeeping” in opposition to our term, “labor.” none of these contradictions, despite their intentions, could obscure the power struggle that lay beneath them.
the labyrinths of these power struggles, which were so systematically manifested in relation to prison, also wove their webs through every stitch of the social fabric.
despite my high spirits at the time, this was a tiresome conflict that consumed a great deal of my energy, of which i was short because of our recent hunger strike in prison.
everybody was convinced that he would benefit from being sent back to his home where he could be relatively free, since in tehran he was nearly imprisoned.
my parents felt it was unfair, for “why should they always take the responsibility for every member of the family?” my father complained that when i was imprisoned, he was not even able to share with his family his horrifying experiences of having his young daughter in such an awful place.
6  maryam a god who cried  listen to the song of the reed, how it wails with the pain of separation: “ever since i was taken from my reed bed my woeful song has caused men and women to weep.” —rumi, in the arms of the beloved  it was one of those hot summer afternoons in ghezel hesar in 1985, when even the air seemed imprisoned.
the prisoners lacked the energy even to wipe away their sweat.
i remembered that, while in evin prison in 1983–84, we used to laugh at one of the regime’s ideologues who insisted on proving that being a devout muslim does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of believing in a scientific explanation of the cosmos, assuming his opponents suggested it did.
a hardworking but poor man with a sick wife and eight children, he was struggling for his family’s survival and worried about his oldest daughter, maryam, who was imprisoned.
then she was on the street, distributing flyers against the islamic republic, and all of a sudden we recognized her in prison.
living in prison, in the world of deprivation and absences, necessitates that one live beyond the images and objects, or rather in the world enriched by one’s imagination where desirable objects are created in their recognized absence.
the art of living in prison becomes possible through imagining life in the very presence of death and observing death in the very existence of life.
art in prison when you lose all sense of self, â•…â•… the bonds of a thousand chains will vanish.
—rumi, in the arms of the beloved  after months of living furtively, since the beginning of a wave of crackdowns on all dissidents in the summer of 1981, bleeding in our hearts  maryam  191  from the news of our close friends’ executions, saying good-bye to our beloved ones every morning as if for the last time, and awaiting our turn, finally one evening in the spring of 1983, there came a knock on our door, and hamid and i were arrested in a small rental apartment in a poor neighborhood of tehran and were driven to evin, a notorious prison.
although separated from other prisoners, i knew that many others were locked in their cells trying to fathom the meaning of what had happened to them and ways to cope with it, as i was.
on the wall, the prisoners before me had carved their names and inscribed some dates long past.
your imagination is what you possess and cannot be easily imprisoned; it is your territory of freedom and an essential element that keeps you from drowning in an impossible situation.
like the prisoners in plato’s allegorical cave, you are compelled to live in your cavelike cell where the outside world seems so removed and illusory.
this is how prisoners become artists and the art in prison comes into existence, not so much for its aesthetic quality but for its existential purpose.
—rumi, in the arms of the beloved  alone in his cell, hamid had announced a dry hunger strike that deprived him of prisoners’ usual pleasure of spending time eating or even drinking tea and water.
for most prisoners, the period under intense torture is rarely the time for creation.
196  maryam  the art of living and becoming in prison they smell your mouth to assure that you have not said you loved [someone].
—foucault, “on the genealogy of ethics”  it is the art of living and the power of resistance in an inhumane situation that gives birth to the delicate handicrafts produced by prisoners.
locked up in their small cells, unable to move their injured feet, prisoners preserve their soul through nourishing their creativity, against the ravages of time and death.
in the world of isolation and forbidden love, loved ones become the source of imaginative power for prisoners.
prisoners engrave their names on such things as pebbles, coins, or woven wallets.
the work of art in prison signifies the prisoner’s refusal to become a totalized, faceless cipher among others.
in their struggle against submission, prisoners employ and reshape objects that cry out their resistance to becoming imprisoned souls and slaves of imposed identities.
the possibility of a departure is embedded in the labor, desire, and imagination invested in producing this art, which creates life in the midst of the prisoners’ deadly situation.
for all these reasons, art in prison is not a luxury but an essential element to keep the spirit moving, which might make survival possible.
maryam  197  it is also for this very reason that some of the most intense battles between prison officials and prisoners were over the making of artwork.
endless rules were announced to forbid the production of anything that expressed prisoners’ creativity and artistic experiences.
it was not merely the content of the art, but far more important perhaps, the very basic desire of the prisoner for making the art that these rules targeted.
the argument was that by occupying themselves with these trivial things, prisoners were avoiding reflection on their past and therefore continued their enmity toward the regime.
guards’ and collaborators’ scrutinizing eyes were present in every corner of the wards to catch prisoners while working on a little pebble, a bone, or a seed found in the meal, or other objects through which their creativity could materialize itself.
even letters to the families, which appeared to prison inspectors as too poetic, too aesthetically literary, or too symbolic and metaphoric did not pass inspection because the officials could either read something more into an ordinary conversation or could not understand the implications contained in symbolic words.
in response to our constant complaints about not delivering our letters to our families, the prison’s director responded, “you are prisoners, supposed to be isolated from your normal life.
certain prisoners were distinguished for their highly stylized and skilled letters, developing aesthetic forms while achieving the main goal of crossing the barriers of communication.
despite the constant instructions by the prison officials that we could not write about spring’s triumph over winter, or about spring’s blossoms, we would usually find ways to express ourselves to pass through their inquisition.
living in prison is an art for which you have to train yourself.
prisoners who accomplish the goal of living through this hell and surviving with their integrity not radically damaged are creators of the art that is simply their lives.
committing suicide can be—not only physically but spiritually—the most inviting drive for prisoners.
one of the most terrifying experiences in prison is to constantly encounter inmates who are seemingly alive yet utterly detached from life.
these are prisoners who never attempt to bend the bars in order to have a glimpse of the sky, stars, or anything that belongs to the outside world.
it is the horror of realizing the danger of dying inside that urges resistant prisoners to hold on to whatever protects them from such a death.
being capable of laughter is one of those ropes that link these prisoners to life.
the art of creating laughter laughter was an essential element in prisoners’ lives.
“it was the victory of laughter over fear” that impressed these resisting political prisoners the most.
prisoners would talk about their fear of torture in such a comic way that it would put them at ease to laugh about it.
prisoners had to confront the alienation and the estrangement toward one another that the authorities were so vigorously trying to generate and reinforce by different tactics.
the prison’s officials and the guards reported any close relationship between prisoners, separating them from one another or employing methods that used one against the other.
prisoners could not share their belongings with one another since sharing was considered a symptom of communist sympathies.
on many occasions, prisoners’ refusal to watch their friends being tortured led to their collective resistance and, consequently, collective punishment and torture.
the essential element of the art of living in prison was to be able to preserve compassion, care for one’s self and others in the world in which, in the words of shamlu, my favorite iranian poet, “they whip love on the obstructed road.”  bahar’s birthday in 1981, bahar was fifteen days old when she was arrested with her mother.
on her second birthday, more than eighty prisoners in her room decided to celebrate the occasion.
some prisoners made the clothes while others did the embroidery.
farangis, a seventeen-year-old prisoner who was arrested when she was fourteen and is now a painter, had prepared  202  maryam  a notebook in which she had painted pictures of animals, flowers, and trees that bahar had never seen in her life.
under the islamic republic, any nonreligious celebration in prison was considered anti-islamic.
some of the prisoners excelled in decorating the stage by using simple materials.
i still joyously recall a time in the new year of 1978 when the chief of qasr prison came to visit our ward and was astounded by our stage decoration.
he could not believe that the furnished living room created by prisoners for our play about the life of an urban middle-class couple was made entirely from newspapers, plastic, and fabrics, dyed with pills or skillfully embroidered.
in prison, everything from a peach pit to a bone to an empty can was considered precious, since these objects became the means by which the prisoner, the artist, communicated and created a new life.
mouloud was one of the prisoners who planted the morning glories in the yard in such designs that they could convey her feelings and ideas.
mouloud, an older woman whose only son was growing up without her, always felt upset that she was unable to protect us from the violence and brutality of prison.
niko, another prisoner and a painter, would use the flowers and leaves to make color for her paintings.
the extraordinarily beautiful jewelry—necklaces, bracelets, or hair clips made out of date seeds—likewise shows that in prison anything can be the ground on which creativity blossoms.
dates were almost the only supplemental source of energy, and prisoners treasured them whenever they were given the chance to buy them.
the prisoners would wash the seeds, put them in some kind of container, and add hot water.
after a few days, the prisoners would take the seeds out and rub them on any hard surface, such as the asphalt ground in the yard or a stone found either in the yard or in one of those trips out of the ward.
i n the winter o f 1 9 7 8 ,  just a few days before the iranian new year,  in qasr prison in tehran we were attacked by a death squad, the special prison guards of the shah’s regime.
being able to cherish those beautiful experiences with my friends gave me the courage and the hope to confront the horror of prison.
the destructive impact of an experience as traumatic as imprisonment, especially under such conditions as the prisons of the regimes of the shah and the islamic republic, extends beyond the thick walls surrounding prison.
the incessant pressure that prisoners experience, the ceaseless fright of impending torture and execution, drains the energy necessary to face the changes.
these qualities, in turn, induce an attitude of conformity toward the very social norms against which a former political prisoner has been fighting.
learning how to refuse the tendency to remain imprisoned within the boundaries  206  maryam  of an immutable self is as imperative for the resistant prisoner as the refusal to submit to authorities.
the loss of motivation to challenge oneself out of entrapment within oneself and failing to seek new ways of thinking and being are potent dangers that prisoners face even, or in fact more, after they leave prison.
when i initially began to write this text in 1999, i realized that my memories of my imprisonment were particularly triggered by my experiences in a new country, the united states, where i had simultaneously found myself a stranger yet at home, for it was here that i had once again fallen in love and lost my love.
and now i had begun writing, years afterward, about prison, but why was i writing?
while in prison, where i could sacrifice my life and body over the words i consumed, i had fought against this silence.
emerging from prison, however, i needed a different space from which i could tell my story.
it was the fear of being trapped by my own words that was so incapacitating—the horror that unveiled the dread of imprisonment, as if the words were going to define me, control my life, or i were going to be possessed by them.
epilogue  213  i was hoping to achieve a new relationship between myself and my writing, one that could be liberating rather than imprisoning, one that was able to illuminate my experience in its various dimensions.
yet in the summer of 2002, i had taken the risk of visiting my family and my home country, ironically also after more than eight years, nearly the same length of time i had spent in prison before returning to my family and iranian society in 1991.
the transformations i encountered during my visit, which i repeated in a longer stay from 2003 to 2004 and later again for three months in the spring of 2005, were as drastic as the ones during the period of my imprisonment, if not more so.
arrests and imprisonments occurred, but neither in scale nor in the treatment and persecution of prisoners could one compare this period to that of 1980s.
mohsen, my nephew, was one and a half years old when my sister and my parents brought him to prison for my first meeting with the family in 1977.
he is no longer a child; he is now married and imprisoned along with his wife.
epilogue  219  when i was released from my second term of imprisonment in 1991, he was already sixteen years old and no longer a child so attached to his maternal aunts and uncles, almost all of whom, including me, left him at about the same time in the early 1980s because of the crackdown on the opposition.
they were either imprisoned, had fled the country for exile in europe or the united states, or lived as fugitives.
i tried hard to reconnect with him after i returned from prison, but one day in the middle of a frank conversation, he told me that during all those years while growing up, when he had needed us the most, none of us were there for him.
now he told me, “now that i am a grown-up and have learned how to handle my life on my own, what do i need you for?” this was, of course, more than painful to hear, but what i could hear was the fear of being attached once again, as he had been after i returned from imprisonment under the shah only to leave for an even longer period.
yet, like so many young people who used to blame their parents for sacrificing their lives without thinking about those who loved them, whose blood is now shed on the streets, who have now crowded the jails once again, mohsen, too, is imprisoned and tortured simply for daring to think and to speak up.
it was the night of the same day i was working on the section of this text where i had a vision of hamid’s execution and his attempt to communicate with me, striving to reach out to me beyond prison walls.
acknowledgments  in march 1978, we were temporarily transferred to a new ward, also located in ghasr prison, supposedly because the well in the yard of our ward was clogged.
here, in this temporary ward, i would have the strangest visit ever with my family in more than a decade of my imprisonment under the regimes of shah and the islamic republic.
i felt ashamed both for putting them through all the torments that having a loved one in prison entailed and for making them look smaller.
yet, without my parents’ love, their incredible humanity, and their trust in me, i could have neither overcome the torture and imprisonment of those many years nor been able to write about my experience.
when in 1999 i initially wrote these fragmented stories of lives in â�iranian prisons—lives that had been ruptured, cut short, or lived in insidious proximity to, and at the verge of, madness and death—my narrating voice vibrated with hesitation and burden that stemmed from the loneliness of the voices, of my own and of those whose stories i was trying  acknowledgments  225  to tell.
the families of those imprisoned, tortured, driven to insanity, or killed by the state were stigmatized and lived under constant scrutiny in a state of near terror.
many, including myself, who had been subjects of imprisonment and torture, left our home country, family, and the mass graves of our loved ones to face the challenges of a new life in an unfamiliar place and with a language that we had to learn as adults.
i was also struck by the resilience and creativity with which they sustained, and created new communities in which, as in prison, the living and the dead continued to live in love and as witnesses to the injustices of the past and present and those that might occur in the future.
it is with dismay, however, that i realize, as i am bringing this text to an end with the hope of a new beginning, that the generation born and raised after the revolution, or even after the iran-iraq war, has now populated prisons their parents once occupied.
here they were themselves tortured, imprisoned, raped, and killed for speaking their minds, asking for their vote, or freedom of expression.
former political prisoners have also published a growing number of memoirs outside iran about the experience of imprisonment, each opening up a window to the dark, secretive maze of this monstrous system.
writing about prison, i know firsthand, is a daunting task, and i am extremely grateful to those who have taken the steps to give voice to these silenced stories.
eachâ€of its chapters becomes entangled with the others while making a life of its own by the creative force of imagination and fantasy that enables us to fly beyond the boundaries of prison and the cages erected by despotic regimes.
their poems, a great many of  230  acknowledgments  which we knew by heart, not only brought color to the gray life of prison and even the larger prison of iran but also enabled us to converse with one another under the censorship.
i also watched these resilient souls in 2009 during a hunger strike in berlin in the rain and cold, in protest of imprisonment, torture, and execution in iran.
not even once during all those years of my imprisonment did she pressure me to do anything against my will, even though this meant more suffering for her.
so prisoners themselves referred to taboota or dastgaha, the plural terms used in this book.
this isn’t a matter of sacrificing moral values to keep us safe; it’s sacrificing moral values for no purpose whatsoever.” page 7â•… banned books and pamphletsâ•… hamaseh-ye moghavemat-e ashraf â�dehghani (â�epics of ahraf dehghani’s resistance) and sirus nahavandi’s farar-e man az â�zendadn (my escape from prison) were the most important of these books.
all the interrogators had pseudonyms by which they were known, at least to prisoners.
he uses the example of a rumor in a small village in spain under franco’s dictatorship about a truth-telling machine that was supposedly used by interrogators to obtain information from prisoners.
notes to pages 39–59  239  page 39â•… soudabeh ardavanâ•… soudabeh ardavan’s book of illustrations about torture in iranian prisons, yaadnegaarehaaye zendaan (reminiscences of prison years), was published in sweden in 2003.
she was herself a prisoner for eight years, and we shared years in similar wards.
there are also several prison memoirs that deal with this particular ward and the experiences lived within it, but all are published in farsi and are works in progress.
one is the ph.d. dissertation by a former political prisoner, shokoufeh sakhi, a student at york university in canada, on her experience of prison.
page 44â•… kinshipâ•… in a documentary film by pantea bahrami, and in love i live, a set of interviews with former iranian women political prisoners, mina akhbari speaks of a strong bond that she feels with her former fellow inmates, a bond that she says remains strong even if they do not see one another for years.
it is a kind of connection that, she suggests, cannot be created outside prison.
page 69â•… source of painâ•… scarry, in the body in pain, points to this reality when she argues that “the torturers, like pain itself, continually multiply their resources and means of access until the room and everything in it becomes a giant externalized map of the prisoner’s feelings” (55).
lastly, they are not univocal; they define innumerable points of confrontation, focuses of instability, each of which has its own risks of conflicts, of struggles, and of an at least temporary inversion of the power relations.” foucault, discipline and punish: the birth of the prison, trans.
in prison a vegetative life, or becoming like a plant, implied a lack of integrity, empathy, and free will, giving up on the social, emotional, and thoughtful aspects of a human life.
page 88â•… torture’s victoryâ•… in her powerful rendition of torture and resistance, shokufeh sakhi, a former political prisoner herself and now a ph.d. candidate at york university in canada, cites a collaborator: “they [the islamic torturers] see a metaphysical power in the cable, a supra-human power.
the entire body of the prisoner must be touched by the cable for the miracle to occur: that is, the person is changed from being a filthy, illegitimate creature who would be burned in the fires of hell into a clean, pure and legitimate creature who will go to heaven.” paper presented at the isis conference, “on the ethical meaning of torture and resistance,” toronto, canada, summer 2008, http://www.dialogt.org/english/shokoufeh%20sakhi2.htm.
page 89â•… resistant prisonersâ•… again, in her reading of the citation from we lived to tell: political prison memoirs of iranian women (toronto: mcgilligan books, 2007), shokoufeh sakhi emphasizes the sociality of the impact of the tortured person’s reaction, including her or his resistance.
this ancient but occluded, most fundamental ethic, the primordial being-for-the-other may be glimpsed in the prison memoirs and wills describing the underlying whys of the prisoners’ resistance.
never do anything to harm people’” (53), or the oath a prisoner makes as she inherits a condemned prisoner’s piece of clothing: “i promise i won’t turn my back on your owner’s pain” (37).
it is exactly this social aspect of resistance against and capitulation to the paideia of the totalizing system that urges us to analyze and understand both the success and failure of tavabization, a phenomenon that has not, of course, been limited to prison systems or iran” (ibid).
page 93â•… sacred wordâ•… ahmad shamlu is a prominent iranian poet whose poetry has been a source of inspiration and a means of emotional expression for resistant prisoners both under the shah and under the islamic republic.
for the prisoners, redness in this poem symbolized courage and revolutionary ideals, while blue indicated honesty and purity of the heart, the person, and the cause.
for this prisoner, her breaking under lashes and her submission to profess her faith in islam and pray indicated the failure of her revolutionary spirit and ideals.
page 147â•… prisoner of horrorâ•… binswanger’s words in “dream and existence” could have been literally written about marjan when he states that the subject for whom dread is internalized is imprisoned by her dread and thus “desperately beats at the walls of its prison” (314).
this differentiation between the imagination and phantasm is what makes the former the embodiment of the possibility of creation and the latter the subject of imprisonment by the power of morbid images.
time and the wall have merged into one.” saadawi, memories from the women’s prison, trans.
page 196â•… handicrafts produced by prisonersâ•… arguing that art cannot be confined to what appears in an “art gallery,” paul willis, in studying “ordinary” young people’s lives in western countries, and specifically in britain, insists that “there is a vibrant symbolic life and symbolic creativity in everyday life, everyday activity and expression” that should be recognized.
his argument seems relevant in thinking about the power of art in prison.
page 196â•… engrave their namesâ•… interestingly enough, like the graffiti writers of paul willis’s study, male prisoners almost always write their own names on everything they make, while females usually put down their loved ones’ names, rarely their own.

as soon as the soldiers carried off the prisoner, a large, enraged crowd gathered around the palace and surrounding buildings.
he was condemned to three years of solitary confinement in prison, followed by house arrest until his death, which came in 1967.
the military arrested members of the opposition, or at least those they presumed to be members of the opposition, imprisoning thousands of young people.
the tudeh had been founded during the second world war by a group of marxist intellectuals who had been imprisoned by reza shah.
the opposition are ‘special’ prisoners and they aren’t processed through the usual channels.” “of course.
and deep down he thinks that javad deserves to be locked away in prison.” at the time i couldn’t really understand what it meant to be locked away in a solitary cell.
infections and diseases—even aids —are common in prison.
in prison, for whatever reason, you’re not allowed to wear socks.
only after it’s over will i learn that psychologists call solitary isolation “white torture.” javad remained in prison for a year.
parì and his mother won permission to see him a few times; though after every encounter they left the prison destroyed.
in prison they had whipped the soles of his feet as a form of torture: as soon as the wounds showed signs of healing, they’d reopen them with more violent lashes.
simin was so happy to have her son back home that she chose not to dwell on his condition and instead dedicated herself to transforming him back to how he was before prison.
javad, accustomed to prison food, barely managed to swallow a few mouthfuls.
she wanted to give him new clothes and the only reason she held back was because of his size: in prison javad had lost more than fifteen kilograms and she hoped he would regain as much of his previous weight as possible.
he decided not to reacclimate himself to the comforts of his past: because prison had revealed to him his future, it had made him understand his duty to oppose the regime.
after prison he felt like a man: he had submitted to his isolation and reclusion in silence, he had forgotten hunger, he had resisted torture.
finally he realized that the problem was his prison sentence, and it’d be difficult to find anyone who would give him a second chance, at least in tehran.
i was surprised to see that javad was absent: no one had said so explicitly, but it was clear that the purpose of the trip was to give thanks for his release from prison.
a year of prison and asthma,” parì concluded, in a philosophical tone.
the demonstrators in 1963 were imprisoned, tortured, and killed.
he had read the prayers during the ceremony that simin had held to pray for javad’s release from prison.
the sister was already a mujahidin, and when she left prison she gradually indoctrinated fariba.
i don’t want him to end up on the ‘ramp of repentance.’” political prisoners were sent to a jail in evin, north of tehran.
before one reached the prison gate, there was a very steep incline; to taunt the counterrevolutionaries, the prison guards told them that the ramp would make them repent, even before they got to the prison.
their methods included electroshock therapy, beatings, and red-hot irons; sometimes they pulled out prisoners’ fingernails.
for this reason one couldn’t appeal to their religious values: they represented a force of good that transcended such earthly concerns as misery, so they didn’t hesitate to torture their prisoners with astonishing cruelty.
property belonging to citizens who were being sought by the state or had already been sentenced to prison was confiscated and appropriated immediately; in other cases the measure was temporary.
the police attacked the party’s central location: two are dead and the others are in prison.
she was thinking, like me, about how her brother had declined during his first imprisonment.
he had been denied every basic human right granted to prisoners, including the right to consult with a lawyer, and the right to see his family.
with the help of some connections she had been able to visit her husband in prison.
“he works at evin prison.
he knew that the doctor was a prisoner there so he paid attention whenever his name came up in conversation.
like my father and me, the doctor loved tea, and it was clear how much he missed it in prison.
“at evin there’s a small hospital for the prisoners.
at first i wanted to refuse—the idea of collaborating with the pasdaran horrified me—but then i realized that i could alleviate the suffering of the prisoners.
thus my career as a prison hospital surgeon was underway.
one day parì received a message on her voice mail that informed her of the date and hour in which she could visit the prisoner.
the last years had broken her heart: abbas was stuck in america and might never return; alì had chosen to move to the front and now didn’t even bother to write home; javad was unreachable, first because he was in hiding, now because he was in prison.
like prisoners, simin and parì had to walk up the ramp of repentance.
don’t you know that prisoners can’t receive gifts?
then a guard ordered them to enter the visiting room; the earlier group was just leaving, relatives bending to hear one final detail before the gray curtain lowered completely and the prisoners disappeared from the other side of the glass.
should i give up after just a few months in prison?” parì exhaled uneasily.
your friends behruz and amir were in prison for a number of months and now they’re out.
as soon as they were out of evin, they both felt the impulse to ruffle their clothes and veils, trying to shake off the prison smell.
“javad’s in prison again,” i muttered, unable to keep my thoughts to myself.
look at the result: he’s caused years of suffering for our mother, he married an even worse fanatic than himself, and now he’s in prison again.
javad was in prison, alì was at the front, borna and arya were in america; simin was in intensive care after suffering a heart attack at the news of abbas’s death.
before parì had left the room, he had already turned to another prisoner’s file.
“if really all the others chose to live rather than rot in prison?
“what?” the pasdar curtly repeated the question: “when he said ‘something warm.’ what was that supposed to mean?” if she hadn’t been behind the walls of a prison, beside a revolutionary guard, parì would have burst into laughter.
simin didn’t recognize any of her son’s clothes, but figured they had given them to him in prison.
they were executing so many people that they couldn’t even figure out what possessions belonged to which prisoners.
just one week earlier, three thousand political prisoners had been killed.
the only response from the tribunal that had issued the death sentences was to affirm that every executed prisoner’s case had been examined by khomeini himself.
but they were too important to be kept in prison; despite being sentenced to life, they were all pardoned and released.
the third had renounced his past and become a dissident; he had been imprisoned for a few articles he’d written that were critical of the regime.
“if they’re anxious to catch alì, maybe they’ll stop me and throw me in prison.
i’d gone through the experience of prison myself, and i told her i’d do whatever i could to save her from the same fate.
that would mean that parì was in a prison somewhere in iran.
you are imprisoned.
many dissidents were either in exile or in prison.
while my family were still ambivalent about the shah’s departure and the revolution as a whole, i do remember a nagging sense of comfort that perhaps this would also be the end of savak and the constant unspoken fear that to do or say something against the government would lead to imprisonment or worse.
iranians wanted freedom of the press, separation of the judiciary from the executive arm of government, a democratically elected parliament and an end to political prisoners.
i felt like i had been freed from prison.
we lived in a prison-like atmosphere where everyone is permanently on edge.
once again i saw myself living out my mother’s imprisoned life.
perhaps my feelings were something like those of a newly released prisoner: free, but having no idea what to do with that freedom.
i know where i am, or at least i can guess: this is evin prison, in northern tehran, some miles from my home in the inner suburbs.
savak had been the most detested institution of the shah, a secret police force licensed to torture, murder, and imprison at will.
in a strange way, those pink shoes and my appetite for the places i might go in them led me, after many twists and turns, to a cell in evin prison.
i think of the vastness of this prison, like a city.

7 i can keep very imperfect track of the time by listening to the call of the muezzin over the prison’s pa system.
it heaves up from my stomach with great force and spills down my prison garment.
do you hear what i’m saying, zarah?” i wasn’t to know it at the time, but the next time someone shouted at me in this way would be in evin prison.
i’m wearing this thing because i was made to!” i looked across at the influential men in the male salon, and i knew that some of them would have been responsible for imprisoning certain of my friends.
i shut the door before removing my prison tunic, then abruptly jump as if a bare electrical wire had been jabbed into my back when the guard kicks the door open.
i have been given a clean prison tunic and clean prison underwear, after handing back my wet underwear.
i am reduced to screaming for help, as if there is someone in the prison who will intercede for me.
i need someone who can provide something even more  comforting—a key to the door of my cell, a second key to the gate of the prison, a car to carry me to some place where the police and interrogators can never find me.
my whole body itches with the irritation of hairs that have fallen inside my prison tunic.
nothing that has happened to me in prison has distressed me like the shearing of my head.
but i absorbed the sensibility behind the stories and poems, a sensibility that created vivid images of struggle, of the soul’s imprisonment, and of freedom.
he puts a series of questions to me, all concerning the recent student protests at tehran university that i took part in, protests that focused on the dismissal and imprisonment of two professors, one of them a favorite of mine who taught a version of iran’s history unacceptable to the regime.
“prison isn’t for you, father, is it?” “father”?
i ask myself if this is a bad sign, as if there were any such thing as a good sign in this prison.
in my spanish studies, i read of republican prisoners in something of the same situation recalling how important it was to know if they were being  taken to execution.
he pushes me into what i assume to be a cell somewhere in this city of a prison.
i am a prisoner here!
has something incredible happened outside the prison, making all the guards and interrogators run away?
but the smell of the food—very ordinary stuff, just prison glug—is unbearably beautiful.
i know that the prison includes murderers in its population, and i can see how, to the regime, killers and political protesters are all of the same bad breed.
the madman belongs in a different prison, a prison for those who transgressed without raising their voices or their fists.
this is where messages are left by other prisoners.
i washed my prison clothes.
the two of us, one a madman with a brain so abused that he doesn’t even know how many years have passed since he was anything other than a prisoner of evin, the other a madwoman keeping herself alive on bloodthirsty fantasies, and both of us laughing.
my fascination has to do with a hope that the victim of my lovely madman’s crime was a prison guard or, even better, an interrogator.
the shah’s agents spent most of his reign grabbing political enemies off the streets and bustling them into prison.
mothers gather at the gates of evin prison to plead for news of husbands and sons thought to be held inside.
i listen to the prison sounds.
i hear the remote weeping sound that’s there all the time, and as always i try to work out if the weeping is that of a real person or something piped in to get on the nerves of the prisoners, the muzak of the interrogators.
such a place is not just a room in a prison; it is a room in a nation.
they would have been gathered up in the big sweeps of the city that the cops and basij militia carry out all through the day and night and brought here to be fined or imprisoned.
the accused will spend thirty days in prison, the days already spent in custody to be deducted from the thirty-day sentence.
this is not simply a prison.
before my prison days, i heard rumors of cars and trucks being seen in the wastes for no reason, and of areas closed off, perhaps because they were dumping grounds for dead troublemakers.
transferral to another prison is one of the worst.
if i am put into another prison, i will find a way to kill myself.

it referred to the instruction on the wall of cincinnatus c’s jail: ‘‘a prisoner’s meekness is a prison’s pride.’’ although i am not particularly fond of nabokov, if i were to choose one of his works to talk about, it would most likely be invitation to a beheading rather than lolita.

when the law of the land prevents certain candidates from competing in the iranian elections, reformists are jailed, and newspapers are closed, these people feel deeply hurt.
in the novel invitation to a beheading, which rlt showcases, the jailer invites the jailed protagonist cincinnatus to a dance.
cincinnatus enjoys the attention from the jailer so much that he regrets the ending of the ‘‘friendly embrace’’ when the dance ends.
the interpretation given for this is that ‘‘as long as he accepts the sham world the jailers impose upon him, cincinnatus will remain their prisoner and will move within the circles of their creation’’ (76).
ironically, rlt has created a world parallel to that of cincinnatus’s jailer for the american reader.
to get an independent, balanced, and fair perspective on the subjects discussed in the book, the reader needs to stop dancing with the jailer and break out of rlt ’s exaggerated world.
and no one will, until the boys are gone and sent to a proper jail.
as the revolution calmed down and the new regime established itself, the two boys were held in a real jail cell, without a bathroom or the service of a hotel.

in the course of nearly two decades, the streets have been turned into a war zone, where young women who disobey the rules are hurled into patrol cars, taken to jail, flogged, fined, forced to wash the toilets and humiliated, and as soon as they leave, they go back and do the same thing.
they were all but one arrested, tortured and jailed.
yassi felt that they had survived the jail but could not escape the bonds of traditional marriage.
those who tell us lolita is a little vixen who deserved what she got should remember her nightly sobs in the arms of her rapist and jailer, because you see, as humbert reminds us with a mixture of relish and pathos, "she had absolutely nowhere else to go."
lolita's image is forever associated in the minds of her readers with that of her jailer.
and more and more i thought of that butterfly; what linked us so closely was this perverse intimacy of victim and jailer.
humbert's narration is confessional, both in the usual sense of the term and in that he is literally writing a confession in jail, awaiting trial for the murder of the playwright claire quilty, with whom lolita ran away to escape him and who cast her off after she refused to participate in his cruel sex games.
there i was told that they had just heard on the radio that my father, the youngest mayor in tehran's history, had been jailed.
for the four years that they kept him in his "temporary" jail-in the jail's library, adjacent to the morgue-we were told alternately that he was going to be killed or that he would be set free almost at once.
i never recovered from the shock of that moment when i was pulled out of the security of mr. holmes's-i think that was his name-stern classroom and told that my father, the mayor, was now in jail.
later, the islamic revolution took away whatever sense of security i had managed to reestablish after my father's release from jail.
in invitation to a beheading, on the wall of cincinnatus c.'s jail, which is decorated like a thirdrate hotel, there are certain instructions for the prisoners, such as: "a prisoner's meekness is a prison's pride."

i had asked my students if they remember the dance scene in invitation to a beheading: the jailer invites cincinnatus to a dance.

dancing with your jailer, participating in your own execution, that is an act of utmost brutality.
the only way to leave the circle, to stop dancing with the jailer, is to find a way to preserve one's individuality, that unique quality which evades description but differentiates one human being from the other.
there was not much difference between our jailers and cincinnatus's executioners.
this constant reminder of his uniqueness, and his attempts to write, to articulate and create a language different from the one imposed upon him by his jailers, saves him at the last moment, when he takes his head in his hands and walks away towards voices that beckon him from that other world, while the scaffold and all the sham world around him, along with his executioner, disintegrate.

nassrin told me more about her time in jail.
you're worried about our brutal thoughts against "them," she said, but you know most of the stories you hear about the jails are true.

she left me to guess what good behavior meant to the kind of people who had put her in jail.
i had heard about so many girls who had married soon after their release from jail, married because they could appease the suspicions of their jailers, who somehow thought of marriage as an antidote to political activities, or to prove to their parents that they were "good" girls now, or simply because there was nothing else for them to do.
the fact that they remembered gatsby and even remembered having fun with him would have been gratifying under different circumstances, but then, i was thinking among other thoughts, how the joy of reading gatsby would now be forever marred by being linked in my memory with mahtab's time in jail and razieh's execution.
i think of razieh in that jail, and of razieh facing the firing squad on some night, perhaps the same night i was reading the long goodbye or the bostonians.

the lonely shoulders unlike my release in 1978, my departure from jail in 1991 under the islamâ� ic republic was not instigated by the power of a revolutionary movement.
there were no people waiting outside the jail this time to carry prisoners on their shoulders or take them to the demonstration.
those of us who did not accept this condition were set free only on a temporary basis, even though we were not asked to return to jail when the period of our temporary release was up.
yet my release in 1978, which seemed such a radical freedom, was abruptly ended by my arrest and return to jail under the new regime.
that entire evening, we continued discussing our options among ourselves—should we immediately leave, refuse to leave until everyone is set free, or choose another option—while the officials came in and out, baffled as to why we were not running out now that the regime was letting us leave without any conditions for release of the sort that kept so many prisoners jailed, sometimes for years after their time was over.

so eager was i to be part of the movement that i did not even have time to acknowledge their exhaustion from having spent an entire sleepless night, during which they did not know if we would ever emerge from jail—for we, the women prisoners, whose names were in newspapers as those to be released, had refused to leave that very night.

in the footsteps of the giants  25  the massacre of political prisoners in the summer of 1988 marked a turning point in the history of political suppression in iran: about five thousand prisoners were executed in the course of two months, and a majority of these prisoners had already been sentenced to jail time or were about to be released.
now with the massacre of most jailed dissidents, the regime considered the potential threat to its future stability eliminated, at least for the most part.
in 1990, the guards brought soosan to my cell from the hospital where her mother lay in critical condition following a heart attack, apparently induced by anxiety because soosan’s one-week temporary release had ended but she refused to sign the paper and was to return to jail.
soosan was one of the prisoners who had remained imprisoned beyond their sentence terms; in fact, her one-year sentence had ended in 1982, but because she refused to submit to the condition of her release, she was still in jail.
the guards made every effort to render our daily life in jail as unbearable as possible.

later, when i learned that the section to which my father had taken me belonged to the baha’i dead, i was surprised that i had not even come across the names of those baha’is whom i knew were executed in jail—apparently my father had intentionally misled me, in his mind to protect me from the pain of my first experience in the outside world in seeing a barren land as the graveyard of my love.
but while in jail, as time went by, the distance between those who were isolated and the others grew deeper.

i strongly relate to the words of a woman inmate who was jailed at the same time i was under the islamic republic: “when it was  72  roya  your turn to be tortured your body was in pain, but when it was somebody else’s, it was your soul that was being tortured.” even though i think when one is tortured, never merely one’s body but also one’s soul is inflicted with pain, i still think the way one’s soul burns while one witnesses others’ pain differs from being tortured oneself.
this was the reason that the guards would break the wings of our plants to illustrate that no wings would survive in this jail.
despite the inhumanity of the torture, what else breaks us down or holds us intact?” soudi’s questions were those of many of us in jail.
