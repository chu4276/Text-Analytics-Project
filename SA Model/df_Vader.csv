1235,-0.1531,0.07,0.872,0.057,maybe this was one of the reasons why after i was lashed and he took me to the solitary cell he asked me if i needed something to help with the pain and he arranged for the doctor to come and see me
1236,-0.5267,0.236,0.764,0.0,after the revolution he wanted revenge so he began working in evin

1239,-0.8126,0.203,0.722,0.076,i was sure that at the beginning it wasnt too difficult for him to justify their arrests his former cell mates and their followers had become the enemies of the islamic state and as khomeini had put it they were the enemies of god and his prophet mohammad
1240,-0.765,0.159,0.841,0.0,ali had been raised a devout muslim and he would follow his imam to the death but he probably began to see that what was now being done in evin in the name of islam was wrong
1241,-0.5499,0.157,0.776,0.067,his faith had blinded him but maybe because of his personal experience he would sometimes see the situation from the perspective of the prisoners
1242,0.6901,0.0,0.787,0.213,for them all that happened in evin after the revolution was completely justified they were protecting their way of life and their values

1562,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i asked

1577,-0.6369,0.243,0.581,0.176,the hardliners who were responsible for his death had murdered him because he had become a threat to them because he had tried to make things better because he had tried to break free

3451,0.0258,0.0,0.969,0.031,one example is the story of some fanatics in iran who have tried to prevent women from biking which is in the same tradition as that of the talibans prevention of women from riding horses

3456,-0.4215,0.159,0.73,0.111,61 kar was bitterly dismayed at sherkat for not coming to her defense and for choosing to protect her magazine over her relationship we always sensed that there was a gap

3459,-0.6705,0.118,0.882,0.0,63 over the years the rift between the two women has been attributed to kars secularism  versus sherkats religious identity and there has been a range of speculation including sherkats alleged fear of possible retaliation by the system loss of employment and imprisonment
3460,0.2878,0.0,0.898,0.102,64 although such conclusions are entirely plausible the decisive issue for sherkat may have been neither one of those considerations

3463,0.2235,0.0,0.944,0.056,66 despite the difficulties of keeping zanan afloat it appears that the determining factor for sherkat was to forge ahead with an arduous undertaking and her altruistic mission believing that nothing is impossible
3464,0.5647,0.053,0.814,0.133,67 therefore the alleged act of betrayal of her colleague mehrangiz kar is in all likelihood attributable not to differences in personal ideology but to sherkats commitment to advancing the womens movement in iran by making certain that zanan endured

3473,-0.4215,0.192,0.808,0.0,this contention stems from the charges accusing sherkat of breaking the law and defaming military and revolutionary institutions

9615,-0.7906,0.263,0.658,0.079,perhaps more than any other official in living memory mortazavi is associated in the minds of the public with abuse and a sadistic passion for punishing dissidents and critics
9616,-0.8934,0.349,0.651,0.0,he is widely believed to have presided over the 2003 prison assault on iraniancanadian photojournalist zahra kazemi who later died of her injuries

9618,-0.0451,0.119,0.77,0.111,i think it would be fair to say that he did not particularly appreciate me as a lawyer
9619,-0.9349,0.372,0.628,0.0,a couple of days into the hunger strike mortazavi publicly told reporters that hunger strikes were illegal under iranian law and that as a result the authorities were denying ganji visitations and phone calls as punishment

9632,0.2732,0.071,0.807,0.122,irans elections have largely been clean if only because the process of vetting candidates is itself dirty high clerical authorities vet candidates and permit only those figures they consider acceptable to make it onto the ballot
9633,-0.4782,0.135,0.865,0.0,as a result there is real rivalry between some figures but it is not a truly democratic process by any stretch
9634,0.1027,0.0,0.962,0.038,nargess was still living at home though she had been admitted to mcgill university in canada to study international law i had persuaded her to first sit for the bar exam in tehran then move abroad

9637,-0.4788,0.182,0.683,0.135,she hated when i told her not to laugh so loudly in publici didnt want her to attract the attention of the morality police but she still felt indignant at being scolded for such a natural behavior

9644,-0.4588,0.158,0.842,0.0,i remembered what one of the interrogators had said to me when i was imprisoned in evin

9650,0.2263,0.176,0.553,0.271,in their place we gained the conviction that the united states wished iran harm
9651,-0.6705,0.314,0.686,0.0,after the coup the shahs men arrested fatemi and executed him by firing squad
9652,-0.3506,0.08,0.92,0.0,in the wake of the 1979 revolution most of the citys streets had been renamed after shia saints islamic revolutionaries or later war martyrs but fatemi had remained fatemi
9653,0.1027,0.0,0.94,0.06,we had founded the center in 2001 and legally the constitution did not oblige us to request a state license for our activities
9654,0.5023,0.0,0.905,0.095,but as with much of everything that went on in iran the authorities applied and invoked the law selectively molding it to fit their political aims and often to quiet their opponents
9655,0.0,0.074,0.814,0.112,i was not an opponent of the statei was a human rights defender and i based my criticisms of the state on legal grounds
9656,0.0,0.084,0.833,0.084,but authoritarian governments are not fond of shades of gray they cannot tolerate any criticism at all and so i knew that at some stage the authorities might quibble with the centers status

9663,0.34,0.0,0.882,0.118,well if youre determined to execute him in advance of a trial i cant be a part of that
9664,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  our conversation ended there
9665,0.7579,0.0,0.794,0.206,but i could not participate in a kangaroo court when it was precisely that sort of abrogation of justice i had spent my life in iran challenging
9666,0.4215,0.0,0.928,0.072,in september 2005 not many weeks into his presidency ahmadinejad walked up to the podium at the united nations general assembly and declared that iran had the right to nuclear power and would defy americas nuclear apartheid

9670,-0.4404,0.095,0.864,0.042,when i had been a law student in the 1960s we had carefully studied key principles of islamic sharia despite the fact that the shah had instituted a secular criminal and civil code
9671,0.4215,0.0,0.884,0.116,after the revolution one would have expected the universities to expand and enhance their teaching of sharia since the new regime had replaced the shahs secular legal system with islamic law
9672,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but nargess was learning less than half of what i had learned about sharia principles in my own student days
9673,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,why was this the case
9674,-0.0572,0.05,0.95,0.0,essentially because the crafters of the islamic republics education system did not want to teach students the subtleties of sharia law philosophy and tradition
9675,0.7003,0.0,0.766,0.234,i was constantly giving interviews meeting new clients and generally functioning more than ever as a repository for those seeking justice

9677,-0.34,0.068,0.932,0.0,  in the evenings nargess and i would often interrupt our work to watch the news both the state broadcasters newscast and the bbc persian service to learn what was transpiring around the world
9678,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the state news often carried images of ahmadinejads trips around the country
9679,0.6124,0.04,0.848,0.112,during his visits ahmadinejad would give speeches to a rural crowd overcome with admiration he would wave their letters of complaint before the camera promising state accountability and he would then walk through the crowd passing around envelopes of cash each holding 100000 tomans the equivalent then of about 50
9680,0.5423,0.134,0.617,0.249,the envelopes much like a drug habit offered a balm to hardship in the short term but they created a far greater problem for the countrys treasury down the line
9681,0.93,0.0,0.703,0.297,during the first two years of his initial fouryear term as president ahmadinejad enjoyed great freedomhe had the unconditional support of the supreme leader whom the iranian constitution vests with absolute power and the backing of the countrys hardline establishment
9682,0.0,0.063,0.843,0.093,when the clerics had taken over iran in 1979 and devised a legal system that vested them with absolute power the running of the economy had ranked low among their priorities
9683,0.6249,0.0,0.841,0.159,one evening as we were all gathered in the living room watching the news the state television station broadcast ahmadinejad giving a speech about the countrys promising young scientists
9684,-0.3612,0.119,0.802,0.079,but it was also profoundly disturbing the extent to which the president would bend the truth contort reality in order to persuade iranians that their country had the right to nuclear power
9685,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  it was just after lunch on an ordinary wednesday when i glanced at the clock and realized it was nearly time for mr

9687,-0.3182,0.127,0.8,0.073,i knew that mahdavi was not his real nameall the states intelligence agents concealed their real identitiesand though his manner was civil the simple fact that i was dealing with someone with a fake name unsettled me
9688,0.4939,0.0,0.856,0.144,the letter had read if you continue your work both you and your daughter nargess will be taken care of
9689,-0.7184,0.201,0.708,0.091,  i hadnt mentioned the letter to nargess she already took all the precautions i thought necessary for her safety and i didnt want her to feel intimidated or even worse resentful at such a young age
9690,0.4767,0.0,0.86,0.14,the iranian state ran various intelligence branches some much more hardline than others and they often competed with each other
9691,-0.2617,0.085,0.878,0.037,in early 2005 i had agreed to represent roozbeh mirebrahimi a journalist and blogger the authorities had arrested in 2004 leveling the various charges they usually brought against reporters who worked for the countrys beleaguered but still functioning independent press
9692,-0.2484,0.156,0.734,0.11,in agreeing to represent him i had repeated publicly that irans judicial and penal system was deeply flawed
9693,-0.5719,0.299,0.701,0.0,if the state stops behaving badly then i wont have anything to say
9694,-0.8201,0.335,0.665,0.0,but if what i say is being exploited the root of the problem is the states behavior
9695,-0.5106,0.268,0.732,0.0,  he looked at me that day with some disappointment
9696,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had been a judge and was now a lawyer and the law concerns itself with intent and the results of intent
9697,0.6369,0.0,0.819,0.181,if the state intended the best for its citizens then it needed to demonstrate that in its behavior toward them
9698,-0.8851,0.257,0.698,0.046,it could not arrest journalists throw them in prison inflict all manner of psychological torture and abuse on them and then dispatch an agent to talk to me about america exploiting my objections to this
9699,-0.128,0.111,0.889,0.0,it was unclear from where but there were shouts of hes been shot
9700,-0.7579,0.317,0.683,0.0, and then it was mayhem as the attackers and the mourners scattered in every direction
9701,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that night the state television news service announced that despite the sacredness of the holy day of ashura the sufis had converged at their prayer hall to drink alcohol and have illicit sex
9702,0.6908,0.0,0.82,0.18,just over a year into ahmadinejads tenure his administration and cronies were giving free rein to the religious extremists that filled the ranks of the states voluntary militias
9703,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,though the members of these militias did not draw formal state salaries they received endless financial perks from lowinterest loans to mortgages to use of government cars
9704,0.7227,0.0,0.768,0.232,they did not wear uniforms but they were supported by the state security forces and they often acted independently of the police
9705,-0.25,0.115,0.791,0.095,often the militias mobilized as a vigilante force breaking up lectures and events they deemed critical of the state as well as setting up their own morality checkpoints harassing young people who had western music or alcohol in their cars and raiding private parties
9706,0.296,0.073,0.808,0.119,while president khatami was in power he had sought to rein in the militias demanding more lawfulness and a respect for peoples privacy
9707,0.7684,0.081,0.721,0.198,but ahmadinejad reversed this course and instead began egging the militias on encouraging their most intolerant attitudes and giving them subtle signals that should they wish to punish those who deviated from their strict view of islam the state would not get in their way
9708,0.1471,0.082,0.816,0.103,the sufis whose mystical practice of islam emerged in the eighth century posed no real threat to the state though their numbers were considerable
9709,0.3801,0.059,0.813,0.127,the more hardline state clergy and the government did not appreciate the sufis they considered them somehow deviant just as they considered anyone who practiced a more tolerant more flexible interpretation of islam deviant
9710,0.2878,0.075,0.772,0.153,the authorities had banned the sufis from practicing their traditional whirling dance as well as a number of their most colorful practices like walking through flames without getting burned or being pierced without drawing blood
9711,-0.25,0.061,0.939,0.0,it was unthinkable that his followers would have been drinking and womanizing in a prayer hall let alone on the day of ashura as all the reports in the statecontrolled newspapers alleged
9712,-0.5574,0.142,0.802,0.057,they said that a few of the wounded sufis had lodged a complaint with the qom magistrates court against some of the assailants whose identities had been determined and also the men who had ordered the assault
9713,-0.396,0.227,0.677,0.096,instead he tore up the document before their eyes and told them that as the guilty parties they had no such legal recourse
9714,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,take the case to mrs
9715,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ebadi and ask her to represent us
9716,0.6428,0.0,0.814,0.186,iranians who were committed to islam but alienated from the official mosques which they associated with state corruption and hypocrisy were attracted to their order
9717,0.5267,0.0,0.88,0.12,as a religious alternative at a time when iranians were increasingly turning away from mosques and state prayer the sufi religion offered a vibrant islamic alternative
9718,-0.5594,0.235,0.714,0.052,the cleric whose own speeches and ceremonies were no longer well attended had demanded that the hosseiniyeh be placed under his authority
9719,-0.3182,0.162,0.748,0.09,ultimately the simmering envy of a few influential clerics had prompted a group of statesupported vigilantes along with their clerical backers to attack the sufis that day
9720,0.2732,0.0,0.916,0.084,i immediately agreed to act as the wounded sufis attorney and i asked two of my colleagues to take on the case with me
9721,0.4404,0.0,0.838,0.162,one was a lawyer from qom mohammad seyfzadeh whose local influence i thought might prove useful
9722,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the next day seyfzadeh visited the office of the prosecutor of the city of qom carrying a powerofattorney letter signed by both of us and the three visitors from qom
9723,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,on that occasion upon seeing my name the prosecutor did not tear anything up and instead opened a case file
9724,-0.8934,0.289,0.678,0.033,seyfzadeh who would later be sentenced to six years in prison for his legal activities requested that the victims hurt during the attack be examined immediately by a forensic doctor to document their injuries before they healed
9725,0.5499,0.0,0.91,0.09,but the court in a delaying tactic asked him to return the following day when he did he was told that the file had been sent to tehran to be handled by the special court for clergy
9726,0.4019,0.0,0.955,0.045,it took two months to refer the case to tehran and when i followed up i was told precisely what i had been expecting to hear that neither i nor any of my colleagues had the right to represent the case because we were not clerics and that it would be handled by the special court for clergy
9727,0.3818,0.087,0.738,0.174,this separate court effectively worked to shield clerics from the law much as diplomatic immunity protects diplomats from being prosecuted for all manner of wrongdoing
9728,-0.6366,0.292,0.594,0.114,so the final outcome of this disturbing and tragic case had really been determined from the outset
9729,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and after that the states relations with the sufis deteriorated sharply
9730,-0.7506,0.235,0.686,0.078,hundreds of sufi followers in cities and towns across iran were arrested and even this mild peaceful section of society found itself besieged and imprisoned made an enemy target by the state
9731,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,just a few minutes before four oclock the key organizers who had arrived early noticed a small convoy of greenandwhite police cars heading down from the north side of the square
9732,-0.3818,0.191,0.809,0.0,out of several police vans flooded policewomen in severe headtotoe black chadors
9733,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but suddenly there were police officers everywhere shouting for everyone to disperse but not letting anyone get away
9734,-0.4588,0.273,0.727,0.0,male police officers attacked the men in the crowd
9735,-0.9042,0.505,0.495,0.0,her face they said contorted in rage as she strode from assault to assault
9736,-0.3182,0.125,0.875,0.0,when women collapsed from the tear gas the policewoman grabbed them by their head scarves and dragged them along the pavement toward the police vans
9737,-0.8689,0.403,0.597,0.0,the authorities put down the protest before it even got started crushing it with a violence no one had anticipated
9738,-0.5994,0.186,0.699,0.116,they injured a number of the protesters and arrested a number of the key organizers even ali akbar moussavi khoeini a reformist former member of parliament who had come out in solidarity with the women
9739,-0.9545,0.493,0.507,0.0,in the days after the crushed protest the tehran public prosecutor declared that the arrested protesters were accused of disturbing public order fostering tension and unrest and spreading lies
9740,-0.1235,0.063,0.888,0.048,the police had of course known about the protest in advance the organizers had posted the date and time on their website for they felt they had nothing to hide
9741,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the activists met shortly afterward to discuss what had happened and to devise a new strategy that the state would tolerate
9742,-0.0754,0.117,0.778,0.105,a feminist movement that was locked up imprisoned and not permitted to organize they knew would be of little benefit to anyone
9743,-0.0772,0.082,0.845,0.073,as i have experienced so often myself being crushed simply gives you greater exercise in collecting the shards of yourself putting them back together and figuring out what to do next
9744,0.5009,0.0,0.876,0.124,the trees outside the building were thick with green leaves and the sun was shining so brightly that i flicked off the office lights
9745,0.0258,0.095,0.782,0.122,it felt like all the efforts that women like me had made in the early years of the revolution pushing back against all that discrimination and state bullying were finallynearly three decades laterbearing some fruit
9746,-0.0258,0.092,0.818,0.09,despite the states fierce repressivenesseverything from laws that permitted stoning and polygamy to morality police sweeps that harassed women on the street for not dressing conservatively enoughiran had a burgeoning vibrant womens movement
9747,0.5994,0.0,0.877,0.123,this wasnt a clique of upperclass women who had studied in europe and were supported by their husbands but a real movement with centers and seminars and training sessions with titles like how to cope with interrogation
9748,0.3818,0.0,0.918,0.082, though it was not something that i particularly wished to take credit for it did seem that my receipt of the nobel in 2003 had propelled the womens activists
9749,0.7003,0.0,0.873,0.127,to have a woman just like them a woman they knew whom they had seen going in and out of court for years under the islamic republic be recognized in this way showed them that the world watched and appreciated their efforts
9750,0.1386,0.066,0.822,0.112,much of the region was still enamored with political islam and in countries like saudi arabia many women were simply not interested in mounting an open challenge to the states patriarchy
9751,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it needs to be an initiative that traditional and religious people also find themselves drawn to not just the secularists
9752,0.1154,0.076,0.797,0.127,  the two nodded in agreement but they said they had to discuss this aspect of their outreach with the committee charged with launching the campaign
9753,0.5267,0.0,0.804,0.196,i made a few minor changes to ensure that all the content was consistently defensible in any court of law
9754,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,divorce law and polygamy
9755,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,inheritance and child custody
9756,0.6369,0.0,0.819,0.181,as to which set of laws you should start with i think this is something youd best ask the signatories
9757,-0.1779,0.074,0.875,0.051,    when it came to launching the campaign the authorities refused the women a legal permit to hold their meeting in a public place or assembly hall
9758,0.1154,0.089,0.807,0.104,but two hours before the start of the meeting security officials warned the owner of the office building that such a meeting should not go ahead
9759,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,everyone gradually began to arrive and they faced a locked door
9760,-0.4576,0.145,0.807,0.048,what this proved was something deeply distressing to the authorities that the demand for legal reform extended to women across the country across class geography and social background
9761,0.8722,0.071,0.707,0.223,the campaigns great success was to develop and build womens awareness around key legal issues like equitable inheritance rights and inflation adjustment for dowriesthese were areas that had the support of traditional and more secularminded women alike and the mounting pressure plus the many thousands of accumulating signatures made the state deeply nervous
9762,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,across the country the authorities began going after activists from senior leaders to even occasional participants
9763,-0.296,0.121,0.879,0.0,the chief prosecutor accused them of conspiracy against national security and the dissemination of lies in society
9764,0.4404,0.0,0.877,0.123,this was because after the officials had carefully scrutinized the handbook the introduction and all the material published and distributed by the campaign they could not find even a single sentence that contravened an accepted tenet of islam
9765,-0.6124,0.122,0.878,0.0,this meant it would be impossible for the state to level charges of antagonism against islam there was not even enough to get a cleric who was on the states payroll to declare that the activists were apostates
9766,0.2023,0.0,0.833,0.167,when the activists went to court i represented a number of them as their defense lawyer
9767,-0.128,0.167,0.73,0.103,in one of the trials i openly challenged the states claim that the womens work had somehow undermined national security
9768,-0.0,0.137,0.726,0.137,but with a justice system that had long ago lost its independence that now walked in step with the whims of a higher repressive authority the fact that there was a court process meant very little
9769,-0.4767,0.194,0.749,0.057,the judiciary sentenced both noushin and parvin to three years in prison and a number of others also received convictions
9770,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the social aspect is key here because the feminist activists managed to disentangle the womens question from the high politics of east versus west iran versus the world and the islamic republic versus democracy
9771,0.2617,0.0,0.945,0.055,none of this meant that irans lawmakers were suddenly liberal and concerned with women standing equally before the law but they were sensitive enough to public opinion to see that society itself was growing more progressive
9772,-0.2411,0.076,0.924,0.0,and as is often the case in iran iranians managed to either nudge the regime ahead or pull it along with themim not sure which
9773,-0.5423,0.123,0.877,0.0,a shaken haleh who couldnt fly because her iranian passport had been in that stolen bag returned to her mothers house and went to the police station in the morning to report the incident
9774,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,the police referred her to some security officials who in turn asked a few questions about her work then let her go
9775,-0.5849,0.324,0.676,0.0,the next time she returned for more questioning the agents arrested her
9776,-0.6486,0.206,0.749,0.045,haleh was a grandmother and close to retirement a delicate petite woman whom no one could imagine in an islamic republic prison cell
9777,-0.5423,0.149,0.851,0.0,i explained to him that i had made a pledge to myself never to receive any payment from any political prisoner
9778,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but as usual the authorities did not permit me to visit haleh nor did they provide me with the case file to study
9779,-0.2732,0.123,0.877,0.0,it was impossible to determine what the authorities believed to be the cause of her guilt
9780,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and why the staged highway robbery
9781,-0.34,0.124,0.876,0.0,why had they not simply obtained an arrest warrant from the prosecutor and picked her up at home
9782,0.25,0.048,0.882,0.07,in halehs case the authorities blocked me from speaking to the interrogators who were seeing her regularly and of course there was little question of my tracking down the intelligence officers handling her case the ones who made all the decisions
9783,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where would i even look for them
9784,0.4767,0.0,0.886,0.114,there wasnt much i could do but as i certainly needed to do something i gave interviews about the case to the press often hourly
9785,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i wrote a letter detailing the case to the u
9786,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,n
9787,0.4404,0.071,0.786,0.143,high commission on human rightsiran was on the committee that year and i hoped it would release haleh to save itself the embarrassment of having the issue raised during one of the committees upcoming meetings
9788,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,not long after the authorities released haleh
9789,-0.765,0.275,0.725,0.0,in the months and years that would follow halehs arrest the iranian state went on to arrest and detain other iranianamerican dual citizens
9790,0.5994,0.0,0.776,0.224,the policy was first and foremost designed by the state to create a bargaining chip with the united states
9791,0.3182,0.083,0.744,0.174,that it sought to create bargaining power through such means only highlighted irans desperation as well as its willingness to use the most compromised means possible to achieve its political aims
9792,0.2263,0.0,0.934,0.066,  on a frigid winter morning i was standing outside our apartment building bundled in a warm woolen coat waiting for a young colleague to pick me up
9793,-0.4019,0.074,0.926,0.0,a few minutes earlier my colleague had texted to say she was nearby and so i had locked up and gone outside concerned that the ice and snow on our street might give her trouble
9794,-0.4215,0.088,0.912,0.0,i might have simply walked up to the main road and taken a taxi but by that time the winter of 2007 i no longer went anywhere on my own
9795,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had dispensed with my stateappointed bodyguards and during one of my recent trips abroad i had bought a vial of pepper spray which i kept in my handbag
9796,-0.4404,0.108,0.892,0.0,i knew that the authorities were increasingly displeased with me and that sooner or later they would choose some way of conveying that more intensely
9797,0.0258,0.222,0.583,0.195,i knew the state was desperate to put me on trial for something but a complaint like this i simply refused to engage with
9798,0.3818,0.0,0.822,0.178,it was becoming clear that ahmadinejads rise to power was inalterably changing everything
9799,-0.128,0.078,0.831,0.09,the political establishment was growing angrier and more intolerant and the middlemen and loyalists ahmadinejad had installed across the regimes many institutions were busy clanging shut any of the small progressive openings iran had experienced under president khatami
9800,-0.3182,0.067,0.933,0.0,the censorship authorities were aggressively stepping up their controls on what novelists screenwriters and academics could publish and even books that had been vetted and published found themselves back on the censors desk
9801,-0.7845,0.289,0.593,0.119,for activists and organizers the situation was growing even more bleak with state harassment of their families threats from intelligence agents and warnings of prosecution stepped up by the day
9802,-0.7506,0.234,0.766,0.0,in its place were arrests of journalists and harassment of dissidents and this put me in a more fraught relationship with the state
9803,-0.0772,0.056,0.899,0.045,i was feeling rather low that day but i said nothing about that as we merged in with the traffic and headed toward the tehran revolutionary court
9804,0.6249,0.0,0.836,0.164,everyone who entered the court building had to go through security and as with all government buildings and public places there were special lines for men and women
9805,-0.0772,0.069,0.87,0.061,we walked toward the womens security section and heard from behind the curtains where the inspections took place a booming voice chastising a woman for allowing some locks of hair to show beneath her head scarf
9806,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i remembered her from my last visit to the court
9807,-0.0992,0.249,0.608,0.143,no deviation no matter how minor escaped this womans stern gaze
9808,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,my soninlaw has taken a second wife and he now wants to divorce my daughter

9811,-0.25,0.149,0.746,0.105,  while the security guards words had saddened me they also bolstered me as i walked toward the court
9812,0.5267,0.0,0.638,0.362,the woman wanted justice for her daughter
9813,0.7239,0.0,0.827,0.173,her words quietly echoed in my mind as we continued down the corridor a reminder that the quest for justice was one that so many iranians shared regardless of their differences
9814,-0.7096,0.19,0.755,0.055,because i was a repository for peoples grievances because they sought me out to tell me their sorrows i knew the security guards concerns were just a glimpse into the vast simmering dissatisfaction that ruled iranian society
9815,-0.4404,0.244,0.756,0.0,where did all that mistrust and resentment reside i wondered
9816,-0.0516,0.084,0.838,0.078,how could it just lie dormant inside so many people as they went about their days their multiple jobs in this city choked with pollution waiting and waiting for something to get better
9817,-0.1027,0.053,0.947,0.0,  on another freezing cold winter day a shoeshine man appeared out of nowhere and set himself up directly across the street from our apartment building
9818,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i never saw him making notes but he did have a mobile phone which he used to report on the movements of those going into and out of my building
9819,0.5719,0.047,0.815,0.138,all the neighbors and local shop owners suspected that the recently arrived newspaper seller was an intelligence agent installed there by the authorities to like the shoe shiner monitor the comings and goings from my office
9820,0.3887,0.079,0.82,0.101,although the authorities handled their surveillance so crudely that my neighbors and friends made jokes it unnerved me to think that vulnerable families of detainees potential clients and activists already sentenced and out on furlough would come to meet me imagining that they were going to a private meeting when in fact their faces and identities would quickly be recorded and uploaded to the states security bodies
9821,-0.7783,0.286,0.714,0.0,one afternoon a client who had spent some time in prison for a political crime arrived for a visit
9822,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he told me when i was just walking past the kiosk i saw one of the revolutionary courts interrogators
9823,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he was inside talking to the newsagent
9824,0.5106,0.0,0.875,0.125,as the tehran winter turned to spring and the snow melted off the tops of the alborz mountains the political situation continued to darken
9825,-0.4588,0.273,0.727,0.0,around this time the authorities forced javad to retire
9826,-0.6124,0.161,0.839,0.0,there was still the possibility of working as a consultantthis didnt have to be the end of his professional lifebut i nevertheless felt a deep sadness and guilt
9827,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it was an early sign that the state would not permit us to flourish together
9828,0.3612,0.054,0.83,0.116,the authorities in tehran had recently rounded up seven leaders of the bahai faith and the community was shaken to its core
9829,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,since 1979 the state has executed more than two hundred bahais simply for their religious beliefs
9830,-0.6486,0.325,0.675,0.0,when the community leaders were arrested no lawyer dared take on their case
9831,-0.9136,0.297,0.703,0.0,no one even lawyers who represent feminists and democracy activists will take on bahai cases because the states hatred and extreme sensitivity are so entrenched that the consequences lawyers fear will be too dangerous
9832,-0.25,0.14,0.766,0.095,that is why the families of those arrested came to me and i agreed to act as their attorney
9833,0.34,0.0,0.861,0.139,not long after i had accepted their case a number of hardline websites began reporting that my daughter nargess had converted to bahaism
9834,-0.7783,0.264,0.736,0.0,under the islamic republics strict interpretation of islamic law converting out of islam amounts to apostasy which is punishable by death
9835,-0.6997,0.279,0.721,0.0,they were trying to scare me into dropping the case perhaps laying out some sort of trap
9836,-0.7096,0.204,0.796,0.0,since then montazeri had evolved into one of irans most liberal clerics though the regime harassed him intensely and kept him under virtual house arrest
9837,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the prosecutor had said that the defendants could not meet with their lawyers until the end of the investigations furthermore i was not permitted to study the files or have access to the allegations against them
9838,0.6369,0.0,0.704,0.296,i believe in freedom of religion and islam defends that right
9839,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  he looked at me stonily so i felt emboldened to continue
9840,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so keep your religion for yourself and i will keep my religion for myself too
9841,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, so what is the meaning of this koranic verse
9842,-0.434,0.3,0.7,0.0,  its a pity that the law does not allow it
9843,0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,if the law permitted me i wouldnt show mercy even to their children
9844,0.5574,0.072,0.719,0.21,they told me that the security officials including the lead investigator had promised to show them leniency in court if they agreed to fire me as their lawyer
9845,-0.6608,0.197,0.803,0.0,my clients did not agree and after they lingered in prison for another few months i was finally allowed to study the case files
9846,0.0516,0.118,0.753,0.129,the prosecutor had accused them of spying for america and israel and conspiring against national security
9847,-0.3919,0.142,0.858,0.0,but their files did not contain any evidence or even reasoning that might point to their guilt
9848,-0.9118,0.318,0.64,0.043,it was clear that they were being punished for their religious beliefs but because it would cause such international condemnation to prosecute them on these grounds the state had leveled espionage charges
9849,-0.765,0.241,0.759,0.0,iranian criminal law does not formally consider being a bahai an offense and because the courts had no evidence of spying these bahais should have been released
9850,-0.6808,0.211,0.789,0.0,but the iranian court sentenced my clients five men and two women to twenty years in prison where they remain to this day
9851,0.296,0.0,0.913,0.087,  it was high summer the whirring air conditioners of the neighborhood creating a collective hum that i could hear from my law office
9852,0.4767,0.13,0.68,0.19,during times of conflict or just a sense of impending conflict its nearly impossible to focus on rights like freedom of expression or the right to an education

9908,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,khanoum ebadi now that i see you theres something i wanted to mention the building manager said
9909,-0.0516,0.099,0.808,0.093,realizing that just on the other side of the wall all these months had been a ministry of intelligence listening post made me angrier than i could have imagined
9910,-0.296,0.091,0.909,0.0,with the center formally shut down or at least physically shut down the authorities imagined they were putting a stop to our work
9911,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but we almost immediately began working out of my personal law office
9912,0.5927,0.0,0.645,0.355,but they had what was effectively a warrant
9913,0.6705,0.0,0.732,0.268,people trust me they come to see me as a lawyer and they share very personal information
9914,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i cant let you have access to that
9915,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  sorry but we have a warrant from the court too the tall one said pulling out another piece of paper
9916,-0.0572,0.196,0.804,0.0,you have no authority over us
9917,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, and they proceeded to push their way inside
9918,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,once again i rang the police station
9919,0.3182,0.0,0.465,0.535,please come immediately
9920,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  within minutes the siren wailed down the street and two officers including the station commander came bounding up to the door
9921,-0.0258,0.051,0.9,0.049,and ill only allow them to take away files if you as the police station commander formally testify in the official procèsverbal of the event that they removed material from my office against my objections and protest
9922,0.2732,0.0,0.488,0.512,  he agreed
9923,0.4767,0.0,0.876,0.124,we compiled a procèsverbal and the intelligence officers carried away two large cardboard boxes full of any documents that had drawn their attention
9924,-0.5574,0.155,0.777,0.068,what they were looking for what they were hoping to find amid all those papers documenting the abuse of critics of the regime was some piece of paper that might prove i was a spy
9925,-0.4215,0.081,0.882,0.037,that i had links with foreigners and that some faraway government was funding my work that every month the american government deposited a check into some imaginary bank account as payment for my defense of iranian political prisoners
9926,-0.1761,0.078,0.922,0.0,i noticed javad becoming more cautious always checking twice or three times in the evenings that our front door was doublelocked
9927,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but while i felt the state circling ever closer it was a reality i most often chose not to think about in order to simply cope with the passing days
9928,0.4449,0.0,0.578,0.422,im not doing anything illegal
9929,-0.6597,0.19,0.81,0.0,with the next secretary a law graduate who was preparing to sit for the bar exam they threatened to deny her license to practice law
9930,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i practiced pro bono law and compared to the going rate in iran the salary of a secretary in the states was considerable
9931,0.0772,0.0,0.966,0.034,and so began the long months where i would plan my days around walking to a public phonei didnt want to call her on a landline or my mobile which the authorities would be tappingto ring washington d
9932,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,c
9933,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, eight and a half hours behind
9934,-0.4404,0.121,0.879,0.0,  perhaps i should have seen it coming should have acknowledged to myself how the states animosity toward me was mounting steadily
9935,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,death to the american mercenary
9936,-0.5994,0.494,0.506,0.0,death to the traitor ebadi
9937,0.4404,0.0,0.719,0.281,  there were so many voices it sounded like a whole demonstration
9938,-0.2732,0.095,0.905,0.0,i was too nervous to go to the window so i locked the office door and fled to my home upstairs
9939,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i ran into the kitchen where a smaller window covered by a thin lace curtain looked out onto the street
9940,0.296,0.0,0.872,0.128,im going to go close the inside door said javad walking swiftly out of the apartment
9941,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,our building had a large metal internal door that could be shut from the inside
9942,-0.3612,0.238,0.762,0.0,with trembling hands i dialed the local police station
9943,-0.4588,0.3,0.7,0.0,there are men outside shouting attacking my building
9944,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,two men were using a metal bar to pry the sign for my law office off the building
9945,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,others had taken out cans of spray paint and were busy sprayingi could only imagine obscenitiesacross the walls of the building
9946,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a moment later a police car appeared slowing as it approached the scene
9947,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,waitwhere are you going
9948,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  the police are here now im going to talk to them
9949,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  i watched from my spot at the window as javad approached the two policemen waving at the building
9950,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they were members of one of the states hardline volunteer militias
9951,-0.9153,0.33,0.67,0.0,these were the men the state dispatched when it wanted to brutalize dissidents attack european embassies raid feminist demonstrations or otherwise bully iranians yet keep itself distanced from that repression
9952,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,by sending in the voluntary militias the state maintained some measure of plausible deniability and it often called the militiamen students
9953,-0.5346,0.113,0.887,0.0, because of this setup the militiamen who attacked our building were permitted by the police to wreak their havoc this was why the police confiscated our neighbors camera but not the thugs cans of spray paint
9954,-0.5719,0.188,0.812,0.0,the attackers had written america crone on the wall and had misspelled the persian for crone ajooz
9955,-0.25,0.219,0.663,0.117,the irony here was that the state claimed that students had been responsible for the attack
9956,-0.4767,0.114,0.886,0.0,the news reports began reverberating internationally enough so that two weeks later the police officers who had merely observed the attack came to my office
9957,0.3182,0.0,0.723,0.277,can you please get your building repainted
9958,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, one officer asked
9959,0.4019,0.0,0.838,0.162,whoever sprayed those slogans on my building can come back and clean them off themselves
9960,-0.553,0.366,0.423,0.211,the people understand very well who provoked and backed the attackers
9961,-0.1027,0.136,0.744,0.12,  the defaced building walls remained as they were the angry slogans bright red and glaring for about three months
9962,-0.6705,0.231,0.769,0.0,they delivered the body to the family two hours ago and theyre saying its a suicide
9963,0.3612,0.0,0.925,0.075,  the previous spring the authorities had gone after omidreza mirsayafi a young blogger from a workingclass family who like so many iranians was finding it harder and harder to get by
9964,-0.296,0.127,0.784,0.088,mirsayafi was referring to the outpouring of support iran had extended to lebanon in the wake of the lebanese militant group hezbollahs 2006 war with israel
9965,-0.4215,0.105,0.838,0.057,as hezbollahs main supporter tehran sent hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and helped rebuild hospitals and homes in beirut bombed during the war bringing salaries and jobs to thousands of lebanese
9966,-0.9186,0.303,0.639,0.058,the tone of the letter was polite but it still provoked the anger of security officials who filed a complaint against mirsayafi to the judiciary which then tried him and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison
9967,0.3182,0.0,0.881,0.119,he was sentimental and posted pictures of roses and poets until his imprisonment in the spring of 2008
9968,0.2732,0.102,0.744,0.153,id rather not write at all if i have to stop being frank and honest in my words
9969,0.0258,0.062,0.845,0.093,  in another post he wrote about an experience that he called his second birth when something inside him compelled him to stop being a passive bystander in the face of committed wrongs
9970,0.0798,0.138,0.666,0.196,obviously he could not simply ignore the insultyet if he did anything he was sure to get arrested
9971,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,having witnessed the scene up close and without any second thought i ran at the basij militia boy and shoved him aside
9972,-0.4588,0.111,0.889,0.0,omid went on to recount the other paramilitaries descending upon him with batons beating him to the ground and dragging him into a police van
9973,-0.7003,0.424,0.486,0.09,we know they tortured him and we want to complain
9974,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  has there been an autopsy
9975,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i asked
9976,-0.5994,0.218,0.782,0.0,if the forensic doctor had examined him there would have been evidence of the torture
9977,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  the ones who washed his body before burial they saw all the bruises
9978,-0.91,0.284,0.716,0.0,i explained that such testimony wouldnt hold in court that sometimes bruising can come after death depending on how the corpse is handled and that only a formal autopsy could prove torture
9979,-0.3094,0.147,0.73,0.122,but an autopsy would have required the permission of a judge which would certainly not have been granted and even in many cases i explained where we had had forensic evidence of torture we had been unable to secure a conviction
9980,0.5267,0.0,0.638,0.362,in another world justice will be served
9981,0.296,0.0,0.919,0.081,when justice is not available to us in this world there is nothing for us to do but seek refuge in a higher power i said
9982,0.8316,0.0,0.476,0.524,and then to trust that justice must be forfeited to god
9983,-0.8399,0.258,0.676,0.065,this was always the most painful part of my work the searching eyes of the mothers and fathers whose children had been killed or were imprisoned seeing in me some potential help
9984,-0.2755,0.075,0.925,0.0,but the reality is that the fate of their sons and daughters rests largely on the political conditions of iran not on my abilities as a lawyer
9985,-0.3182,0.063,0.937,0.0,my daughter nargess now living in canada while studying for a masters degree in law was returning to tehran that evening to visit with us and finish up some loose ends with her law apprenticeship
9986,-0.631,0.129,0.871,0.0,i tried to chat naturally as we drove and went inside but once i saw nargesss face as she emerged from the arrivals hall i knew something was wrong
9987,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,maman theyve taken my passport away she said
9988,0.4767,0.0,0.871,0.129,when had she become so unflappable able to be breezy under interrogation with an intelligence agent who had just confiscated her passport
9989,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,as i stared at the old wooden clock on the wall which i had bought on jordan street not long after our marriage i couldnt say what exactly i couldnt follow the thought out to its logical progression
9990,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the state had finally started going after my family
9991,-0.8957,0.233,0.728,0.038,i had witnessed this over the years with many of my clients dissidents and activists whose relatives suffered state intimidation were hassled and threatened and sometimes blackmailed or imprisoned all collateral damage in the quest to get the original targetthe dissident or activist or journalist in questionto drop their activities
9992,-0.25,0.16,0.734,0.106,in one typical tactic the spymasters would simply arrest the loved one of a political prisoner who was resisting the states demands to make a false confession and incriminate himself
9993,-0.926,0.38,0.62,0.0,they would then tell the prisoner that his sister or wife had been arrested and that unless he confessed they would be forced to torture her
9994,0.6361,0.0,0.844,0.156,i was just a lawyer by dint of having my career as a judge suspendeda lawyer working to make the laws of the country more fair trying to promote lawfulness
9995,0.0129,0.088,0.79,0.122,to me this was as clear as the light of day but for the authorities growing more merciless by that same light it seemed to make no difference
9996,-0.4767,0.383,0.617,0.0,i really havent done anything wrong
9997,0.743,0.0,0.76,0.24,    in the days that followed i sometimes overheard her on the phone with her friends still laughing off her situation

9999,-0.34,0.146,0.854,0.0,  as a precaution javad insisted that we install a burglar alarm in our house
10000,0.296,0.0,0.879,0.121,he chose a system that would automatically alert the local police station in case of a breakin
10001,-0.5683,0.236,0.673,0.091,i found this ridiculous because if we ever faced attack it would be the authorities themselves who would be responsible
10002,-0.1027,0.06,0.94,0.0,several days passed and the authorities summoned nargess for questioning on the very day i was due to travel abroad for a seminar
10003,0.2415,0.071,0.829,0.1,would i board that plane and turn my back on my daughter aware that so often when intelligence agents summon someone for investigation it is an occasion to arrest them

10236,0.6249,0.0,0.872,0.128,this too proved that my work outside the country could still have a great impact on the government and what people inside the country were thinking and talking about

10265,0.5478,0.097,0.668,0.236,iranian law exempts income from awards and prizes from taxation so there was no basis to tax the nobel money
10266,0.5423,0.0,0.852,0.148,a friend and colleague of mine at the defenders of human rights center nasrin sotoudeh took up the case on my behalf and went to file an objection
10267,0.3818,0.057,0.815,0.128,one visit to the tax office was enough to make clear who had concocted the charges the tax officials told her that the herasat or safeguarding section was very sensitive about the case
10268,0.4767,0.0,0.881,0.119,herasat is the term for the section of each ministry or organization across the government through which the ministry of intelligence exercises its influence

10273,0.5574,0.128,0.642,0.229,when the case reached the board of settlement of tax disputes the tax officials argued that the nobel prize is a political award and as such is taxable
10274,-0.5647,0.178,0.771,0.051,that should have settled the matter but the board had decidedor been instructed in advancethat i was guilty
10275,-0.25,0.185,0.714,0.101,for agreeing to defend me and for her other human rights work she was sentenced to six years in prison

10277,-0.7717,0.211,0.789,0.0,i wished that the international media paid more attention to how iranians in the younger generation were being systematically bullied by the state into abandoning their work
10278,-0.6808,0.143,0.83,0.027,the climate in which i had built up my practice and established myself no longer existed and by meting out such a harsh sentence to nasrin the state was trying to intimidate the few remaining human rights lawyers who had not already gone abroad
10279,-0.4215,0.088,0.912,0.0,the court also barred nasrin from practicing law or leaving the country for twenty years and found her guilty of acting against national security and of propaganda against the regime
10280,-0.8991,0.299,0.661,0.04, apart from her recent work defending my seized assets the main focus of nasrins work had been to defend irans most vulnerable citizens prisoners of conscience and minors facing the death penalty

10290,-0.7003,0.277,0.597,0.126,  they refused to allow her to visit with her children and began summoning her husband for interrogation threatening him with prosecution as well
10291,-0.4215,0.135,0.865,0.0,but she stood firm and i worried for her because she was inside the country firmly within their grasp
10292,-0.5106,0.131,0.833,0.036,the state viewed them as guilty in their own right for their own human rights work and the defense of their clients but their ultimate guilt came from their association with me
10293,0.1779,0.044,0.884,0.072,unable to snare me the authorities had systematically tracked down and sentenced virtually every significant colleague i had worked with over the past decade

17671,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,a guard walked us about two hundred yards across the courtyard to a separate building where prisoners and their attorneys met
17672,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the building was a small crowded place where guards and soldiers milled around and lawyers waited for their clients to arrive
17673,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,there was a row of glass cubicles with a table and four chairs in each and a window between the lawyers and the inmates
17674,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when our names were called we stepped into one of the cubicles where mr
17675,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,aghasi was waiting
17676,-0.5574,0.187,0.813,0.0,therefore i have no idea about your background the circumstances of your arrest previous interrogations or what stage your case is in
17677,0.128,0.0,0.923,0.077,im told i will have them a couple of days before your trial so i can prepare my defense
17678,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and what exactly are your religious beliefs
17679,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, knowing our time with mr
17680,-0.5106,0.163,0.837,0.0,aghasi was limited we briefly recounted the story of our arrest the search of our apartment and the various places we had been held
17681,-0.4404,0.149,0.791,0.06,he told me that if you continue to repeat your position in the courtroom a heavy punishment awaits you
17682,-0.6808,0.362,0.51,0.128,the punishment for apostates and for promoting christianity in this country is death
17683,-0.743,0.397,0.524,0.079,the only way to avoid this is to deny the charges and admit you made a mistake
17684,-0.7845,0.697,0.303,0.0,weve been threatened with death
17685,0.4847,0.0,0.56,0.44,were not afraid of death
17686,-0.3252,0.152,0.848,0.0,what were afraid of is life without faith life without our savior jesus christ
17687,-0.5719,0.171,0.829,0.0, i could feel my anger rising at the very thought that our lawyer would be suggesting this now
17688,-0.34,0.173,0.733,0.093,if you are cornered in a dangerous situation you can get out of it by telling a lie and still keep your own true belief
17689,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we will never renounce our belief even for the sake of momentary convenience
17690,0.7096,0.0,0.699,0.301, well in this case women stand a better chance of being acquitted than men he told us philosophically
17691,0.0772,0.075,0.843,0.082,in islam women are given more leniency and more time to repent because according to islamic law a womans wisdom is half that of a man and theres always the likelihood they will choose the wrong path
17692,0.2263,0.0,0.917,0.083,since according to islam men have a fullsize brain they are not given a second opportunity but must be executed right away
17693,0.1027,0.155,0.71,0.135,however according to our countrys laws you are guilty of an offense so we must do our best to get you out of this situation
17694,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the armed guard outside our cubicle said we had five more minutes
17695,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in that brief time mr
17696,-0.765,0.355,0.645,0.0,aghasi asked us about our prison conditions and the other prisoners in our ward
17697,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we then went to an office together to sign and stamp the forms to officially appoint him as our lawyer
17698,-0.5106,0.13,0.87,0.0,we had seen her talking to other lawyers and prisoners and had caught her looking at us several times from across the room
17699,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,is mr
17700,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,aghasi your lawyer
17701,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, she asked

17705,-0.6705,0.478,0.522,0.0,or were you arrested in the street disturbances
17706,-0.3818,0.245,0.755,0.0, we are being prosecuted because we are christians
17707,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, you are marziyeh and maryam
17708,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,have you had access to a lawyer from the beginning
17709,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0, we have been in prison six months and this is the first time weve talked with a lawyer
17710,0.6115,0.0,0.667,0.333, im very happy to see you in person
17711,-0.5106,0.216,0.784,0.0,im here today gathering the latest news on the cases of political prisoners
17712,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we heard it when we were in revolutionary court
17713,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, heydarifar was the prosecutor who had insisted we be executed
17714,-0.34,0.13,0.87,0.0,heydarifar sobhani and another man saeed mortazavi were implicated in the unlawful arrest and transfer of protestors
17715,-0.9201,0.485,0.438,0.077,some have said they were responsible for the torture and murder of prisoners at the kahrizak detention center
17716,-0.886,0.265,0.688,0.048,the three people who were responsible for our court case the three who had indicted us for apostasy and demanded we be executed were now accused of torture and murder and would themselves be tried behind closed doors
17717,0.1531,0.095,0.785,0.12,this good news was tempered by the fact that replacing the three court officials would mean another delay in our case
17718,0.1091,0.172,0.624,0.205,these three were likely no more guilty than many others
17719,-0.9413,0.392,0.608,0.0,but the regime had to blame somebody in order to take the spotlight off the illegal elections the public unrest and the worldwide outcry demanding our release
17720,0.4215,0.0,0.865,0.135,it was another renegade decision by the rulers designed to stifle legitimate dissent and keep the powerful in power
17721,-0.5106,0.163,0.837,0.0,this also was a stark reminder that prisoners are not the only ones who are captive in iran
17722,-0.4118,0.121,0.879,0.0,everyone who lives under this repressive regime isand will remaina spiritual captive as long as these leaders maintain their iron grip
17723,0.4215,0.0,0.851,0.149,we tried not to think about the slow progress in our case and what might happen next
17724,0.0772,0.0,0.954,0.046,when many people were at the cultural centerwhere we werent allowed at first because we were unclean apostates and where we didnt want to go later when mrs
17725,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,rezaei insisted we be allowed towe sat on our beds and knitted
17726,0.4019,0.0,0.926,0.074,after that we went back to the ward to read some of the official newspapers we were getting them again listen to the radio news and hold political discussions with other women who were interested
17727,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,word spread through the ward that some political prisoners from ward 209 were going to be transferred over to our hall
17728,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then we went downstairs where they would be brought in and as the door opened there stood mahtab fereshteh and setare
17729,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,despite the fact that there were already thirtyfive women crammed into room 1 we convinced mrs
17730,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ghaderi the woman in charge of our ward to send all four of the newcomers to our room
17731,-0.4404,0.116,0.884,0.0,with all the arrests after the election there were four or five people in each tiny cell where three had been a crowd
17732,-0.1531,0.111,0.802,0.088,some of the new inmates there were prominent officials and politicians now living under the same conditions as the people they once condemned
17733,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,the flow of prisoners in the public wing had also picked up and many women came and went in the ward
17734,-0.1779,0.114,0.796,0.09,maryam and i took on the task of greeting new prisoners introducing them to other inmates and explaining the rules and traditions of the ward
17735,0.0258,0.085,0.799,0.116,this gave us an opportunity to spend some time with arefeh who had been arrested during a demonstration and held because her family members were mujahideen even though she herself was not
17736,0.6808,0.081,0.63,0.289,she was curious about our faith especially when she learned that we refused to renounce it in order to be freed
17737,-0.3237,0.16,0.737,0.103,she told us we were silly and added i think it is sheer stupidity that you two can buy your freedom by renouncing your beliefs and just walk out of this terrible place
17738,-0.34,0.156,0.844,0.0,how could i ever deny something that is in every cell of my body
17739,-0.7717,0.456,0.544,0.0,holding on to our beliefs means rejecting injustice and inequality
17740,0.34,0.13,0.649,0.221,is it not your pursuit of justice and your protest against oppression
17741,-0.2144,0.066,0.934,0.0,at first i thought it was my usual stomach trouble but soon i was running down the hall to the toilet where i vomited again and again
17742,-0.6442,0.205,0.721,0.074,shirin and marziyeh came to help me back to the cell but i was so weak i could hardly stand
17743,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they put me in a bed close to the door in case i had to go back to the toilet
17744,0.4019,0.0,0.856,0.144,someone called a guard and after a few minutes convinced her to take me to the clinic
17745,-0.3612,0.111,0.889,0.0,marziyeh wanted to go with me and argued with a guard while i leaned against the wall barely able to stand
17746,0.128,0.0,0.889,0.111,the guard made me put on a chador and carefully cover my hair
17747,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the guard went down the stairs in the direction of the clinicfifty steps in all
17748,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,come on hurry up
17749,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the guard barked
17750,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i cant wait all night
17751,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, when we got downstairs a guard told me to wait until he could coordinate with the doctor
17752,0.1027,0.0,0.833,0.167,quit pretending to be sick the guard ordered
17753,-0.2924,0.285,0.715,0.0,okay the guard said i know youre not feeling well
17754,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,just control yourself and hurry up
17755,0.1027,0.0,0.938,0.062, when we reached the clinic the doctor on duty gave me a quick glance and asked the guard what had happened
17756,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if  you need to get up you can use that little toilet in the corner she said
17757,0.1779,0.127,0.711,0.162,the next morning my hand was swollen and sore where the iv needle had been inserted
17758,0.4939,0.0,0.842,0.158,please take this needle out of my hand and let me go back to my ward i said
17759,0.1298,0.209,0.543,0.248,my hand is completely numb and im completely frozen
17760,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, shirin alam hooli and marziyeh were waiting for me in the ward
17761,0.4019,0.0,0.87,0.13,they had stayed awake all night in case i needed them and there was any way they could help
17762,-0.4572,0.277,0.506,0.217,but in a place like evin prison they mean even more because the prisoners have so little else to encourage them
17763,-0.4019,0.165,0.759,0.076,she had been sentenced to death and was waiting for a final ruling from the court as to whether or not she would get a pardon
17764,-0.4019,0.088,0.912,0.0,every time her name was called we were afraid it could be a summons to the isolation cell where she would wait out the last day before her execution
17765,-0.0093,0.088,0.825,0.087,marziyeh before maryam and i had gone to ward 209 id had a dream about shirin that i had never shared
17766,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,shirin went to 209 for further interrogation
17767,-0.6908,0.306,0.528,0.166,they said if she would answer their questions and betray her friends they would commute her death sentence
17768,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,go ahead and execute me
17769,-0.5719,0.17,0.83,0.0, as long as she had been in prison and as often as she had been questioned she sensed that her situation was different now
17770,-0.7964,0.119,0.881,0.0,she felt somehowwith the indefinite intuition of a person who knows something but cant tell you how she knows itthat the court had already decided to execute her and now was only trying to coax as much information out of her as possible before killing her
17771,-0.0516,0.074,0.926,0.0,if youre released before i get back leave it with another inmate to return to me
17772,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, she also gave us her books and other things to look after once she was transferred
17773,-0.743,0.283,0.717,0.0,one reason for her latest interrogation was that a judge had been murdered and the kurds were suspected
17774,-0.5106,0.171,0.829,0.0,the authorities were grilling kurdish prisoners to see if they could get any clues in the case
17775,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a few days later we saw the news that several kurds had been executed including a boy
17776,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the lights were out and several inmates were watching tv
17777,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,maryam said you know the boy who was executed today dont you
17778,-0.4767,0.256,0.744,0.0,  without looking up shirin nodded and began to cry
17779,-0.6597,0.233,0.697,0.07,she cried her eyes out as if shed hidden a huge sorrow inside until she couldnt hide it anymore and now wanted to let it all go
17780,-0.7506,0.328,0.552,0.12,our unshakable kurdish heroine who had endured months of torture and years of imprisonment without flinching suddenly seemed broken and defeated
17781,-0.7351,0.508,0.492,0.0,im sick and tired of the whole situation
17782,0.5454,0.122,0.691,0.187,ive seen so many people i love executed lost so many of my friends at the hands of a merciless regime that has no compassion toward anyone even a twentyyearold boy
17783,-0.434,0.17,0.755,0.075,as the weather turned cool inmates without warm clothing began to suffer when we were all herded out into the courtyard for the morning roll call
17784,-0.5563,0.146,0.854,0.0,most prisoners still went out before sunrise for muslim morning prayers too and everybody had to go out to register at 630
17785,-0.5106,0.231,0.769,0.0,it was announced that prisoners could receive new clothes from their families
17786,-0.5984,0.234,0.766,0.0,evidently the idea was to make it harder for inmates to hide any sort of weapons or contraband
17787,-0.2247,0.14,0.771,0.088,shamsi was in charge of room 2 and had become a friend even though she had been a tough gang member on the outside and most prisoners were afraid of her
17788,-0.8779,0.315,0.685,0.0,she also organized a system for bartering and buying clothes among the prisoners and got clothes for the poorest prisoners who couldnt afford their own
17789,-0.765,0.202,0.798,0.0,in the wake of all the protests the arrest of some of the judges and the overcrowded conditions at evin the guards became much stricter about prisoners going outside for morning roll call
17790,-0.765,0.452,0.548,0.0,in the past old and sick prisoners had been excused
17791,0.1113,0.062,0.862,0.076,soraya the huge woman with a cell and a shower of her own never went out for roll call because it was so hard for her to walk
17792,-0.7579,0.2,0.8,0.0,but now they began to enforce the ruleperhaps only because they knew they had the power to do it and because they knew it was uncomfortable and inconvenient
17793,-0.5106,0.248,0.752,0.0,out of bed and into the prison yard for roll call
17794,-0.3818,0.202,0.698,0.101, anyone who disobeyed was denied access to the cultural center lost her phone privileges and wasnt allowed visitors or parole
17795,-0.765,0.306,0.694,0.0,some of the sick prisoners shivered with cold just getting out of bed never mind going outside
17796,-0.5106,0.125,0.875,0.0,after that everyone except for marziyeh and me and a few political prisoners had to face mecca and recite in arabic the omalyajib prayers
17797,-0.9618,0.432,0.517,0.052,the guards were hoping to make the old and weak prisoners out to be the enemy getting us to blame them instead of the guards for the inconvenience and causing disagreements or even fights among the prisoners
17798,-0.765,0.167,0.833,0.0,the bad situation was made even worse on days when we had to go back outside a second time for the guards to search our personal belongings or when they came through occasionally spraying disinfectant
17799,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,one morning we had just come inside from another bonechilling roll call and were eating breakfast when we were ordered back into the courtyard
17800,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,once we were all assembled everyone who used the cultural center was ordered to go there and everyone else was ordered to remain outside for the rest of the day
17801,-0.743,0.441,0.559,0.0,even the old and sick inmates were forced to obey
17802,-0.4588,0.177,0.753,0.07,though a number of women went to the cultural center the yard was packed with prisoners
17803,-0.8689,0.366,0.634,0.0,after a while some of the prisoners started sitting and lying on the ground which made the crowding even worse
17804,-0.4019,0.124,0.876,0.0,soraya whose kidney problems were familiar to everyone called out that she had to go in and use the toilet
17805,0.7178,0.0,0.838,0.162,the women in the cultural center had heard the yelling and were very happy to know we had stood together for even so small a thing as the chance to go back inside
17806,-0.5106,0.268,0.732,0.0,the reason we believed was that the prison warden mr
17807,0.7968,0.127,0.569,0.304,sedaghat was under some kind of pressure to show that his prisoners were happy well cared for and being educated at his cultural center where they were all behaving like nice muslim women
17808,-0.3612,0.097,0.85,0.053,on top of everything else the prisoners who were drug addicts were allowed into the cultural center for the first time making it harder than ever to get a place there
17809,0.128,0.0,0.952,0.048,everyone being out of the ward all day also wrecked our carefully planned schedule of shower times which was essential since there were more than 150 women and five available showers
17810,-0.6801,0.383,0.617,0.0,any sort of coordinated prison protest was almost unknown in evin
17811,-0.1779,0.103,0.835,0.062,on the eve of an execution or after a major event was reported in the news our phones were cut off and we were locked in our cells until it was clear we had no plans to react
17812,-0.8689,0.266,0.734,0.0,there was also always the threat of punishment we heard many stories of women considered troublemakers who were taken to a building next door and returned swollen bruised and bleeding
17813,-0.4588,0.167,0.833,0.0,marziyeh and i had been banned from the cultural center since the beginning of our imprisonment
17814,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the next morning when we were all ordered outside marziyeh and i were the only ones who stayed in the ward
17815,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the guards came through but they didnt step inside our cell and didnt notice us under our blankets
17816,-0.2263,0.107,0.829,0.063,after the other inmates returned everybody wanted to know how we had managed to avoid the mandatory trip outside
17817,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when my turn came mrs
17818,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,rezaei ushered me inside
17819,-0.7717,0.295,0.705,0.0,many other inmates suffer from various illnesses and disabilities that make it impossible for them to stand outside
17820,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we would rather go to solitary confinement than tolerate this inhumane treatment
17821,-0.4215,0.167,0.833,0.0, miss rostampour i am as unhappy as you are about this new routine mrs
17822,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,rezaei replied
17823,-0.4215,0.382,0.441,0.176,defiant prisoners will be sent to the security section
17824,-0.5106,0.398,0.602,0.0,everybody in the ward is sick
17825,-0.4585,0.25,0.75,0.0, im not happy about the situation either said mrs
17826,-0.296,0.268,0.732,0.0,rezaei but we have no other choice
17827,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,im not the one who makes the decision
17828,0.2449,0.087,0.788,0.125, i could see there was no point in continuing the conversation so i thanked the warden and returned to my cell
17829,-0.4019,0.18,0.694,0.126,though her complaint was justified it was yet another example of her resisting authority which looked bad considering her case and the latest round of interrogations
17830,-0.5563,0.246,0.754,0.0,most prisoners were afraid of the guards and obeyed their every word
17831,-0.2023,0.306,0.463,0.231,however political prisoners like shirin were different
17832,-0.8047,0.24,0.76,0.0,but even some of the prison staff were now saying that the crowding situation was impossible and that the cultural center could no longer function
17833,-0.5106,0.32,0.68,0.0,prisoners needed to stand up for their rights
17834,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,reihaneh came from ward 209 to the public ward and was assigned to our room
17835,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,wed heard a lot about her case from radio and television

17884,-0.8995,0.448,0.552,0.0,because they give all sick prisoners the same medicine no matter whats wrong with them and it has no effect whatsoever

17886,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, as marziyeh and mr

17890,0.34,0.0,0.844,0.156,they can call the security office directly and get permission to bring vitamins in
17891,-0.8625,0.336,0.664,0.0, marziyeh told him about the terrible food the poor health of so many inmatesincluding herselfand the stupid early morning roll call
17892,-0.8658,0.244,0.675,0.081,and the new rule is only making matters worsethe terrible health care combined with the requirement to go outside in the cold every morning is making the sick prisoners sicker and the ones who arent sick yet are going to catch something
17893,-0.4019,0.278,0.722,0.0, i know these problems very well mr
17894,0.1027,0.0,0.417,0.583,ramezani admitted

17903,0.3612,0.07,0.793,0.137,then our incredible conversation ended and we went back to the ward where our friends were waiting nervously for us
17904,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we told them that everything was all right that the authorities just wanted to know more about the letters we were getting from around the world

17908,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said it was not possible for a lawyer to do that
17909,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,within a week maryam and i were summoned to the office and told to prepare for court the next day
17910,0.6808,0.0,0.741,0.259,our friends assured us that this time around we would finally have our bail set and be released
17911,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,others said because of all the publicity surrounding our case we would be  released unconditionally
17912,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the next morning we were up early waited hours for the minibus to the court and sat handcuffed together for the ride across town
17913,0.4215,0.0,0.797,0.203,they waved and shouted encouragement and followed us to the court building
17914,0.1531,0.0,0.952,0.048,the last time wed been to the revolutionary court the judge had told us that if we didnt change our story our case would be transferred to bureau 15 for a final verdict
17915,-0.9022,0.366,0.634,0.0,the judge there who was also the judge in shirin alam hoolis case was famous for sentencing prisoners to death or to life in prison
17916,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but when we entered the building this time we saw from the sign that we were going into bureau 26
17917,0.5709,0.0,0.749,0.251,he comes from the family court and is a very kind man
17918,-0.2263,0.241,0.759,0.0, we stopped outside the courtroom door
17919,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i was only informed about your court summons yesterday

17923,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this was the first time they had been allowed in the building when we were there
17924,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we waved goodbye to our sisters and passed through a very large courtroom into another one that was smaller
17925,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,there was a raised desk at one end where the judge sat
17926,0.5267,0.0,0.805,0.195,on the wall behind him was a large color photo of the scales of justice
17927,0.7351,0.0,0.744,0.256,looking up at the scales of justice i knew that our faith and our lives were hanging in the balance
17928,-0.3612,0.293,0.573,0.134,chapter 23 guilty as charged marziyeh our lawyer greeted the new judge
17929,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but mr

17931,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, this was incredible news
17932,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,our lawyer asked him why mr
17933,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,larijani was involved
17934,0.4215,0.0,0.872,0.128,sources at the united nations have telephoned him and asked him to sort out this case as soon as possible
17935,0.4215,0.0,0.851,0.149, in time we learned who had brought our case to the attention of the united nations
17936,-0.7096,0.239,0.692,0.069,do you realize that due to your perseverance our enemies have taken advantage of the situation and run several negative campaigns against us
17937,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,maybe you dont know what kind of people are using you and your case for their own objectives
17938,0.6597,0.0,0.828,0.172, there had been a vigil in front of the iranian embassy in london supporting our release another reminder that christians around the world were praying for us
17939,-0.7772,0.277,0.648,0.075,as good as this made us feel the publicity made things trickier for the iranian judiciary and the governments anger grew along with its frustration over not resolving our case
17940,-0.5574,0.317,0.565,0.117,the judge said the charges of propaganda against the regime and insulting our sacred values are baseless
17941,-0.5574,0.281,0.615,0.104,therefore i hereby acknowledge your acquittal from the charges of instigating propaganda against the system and insulting our sacred values
17942,-0.4939,0.203,0.686,0.111, just like that without a statement or a word of testimony from us we were cleared of these serious charges after months of interrogation humiliation and judicial stalemate
17943,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,now we come to the charge of apostasy
17944,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this charge remains valid
17945,-0.8779,0.35,0.606,0.044,and as you know the sentence for this crime is the death penalty for men and life imprisonment with labor for women
17946,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the judge looked at our lawyer
17947,0.3182,0.0,0.796,0.204,im sure youve already briefed your clients about this issue
17948,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, yes i have
17949,-0.5574,0.214,0.714,0.071, we had been told repeatedly that the maximum sentence possible for us was death
17950,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we knew of plenty of women who had been executed in iran
17951,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,however this was also the second time wed heard that we could not be executed because we were women
17952,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and as maryam had reminded me the night before when our court date was announced over the loudspeaker today october 7 was the fouryear anniversary of that day
17953,0.8402,0.0,0.71,0.29,i had never wanted to be baptized inside a church but instead wanted the ceremony in a natural setting like the one in my dream
17954,0.6808,0.0,0.823,0.177,and though i was very afraid as i sat in this islamic courtroom with my life on the line it was just as easy to say yes now
17955,-0.5994,0.262,0.738,0.0,i would willingly follow jesus to a new life or to death
17956,0.4215,0.0,0.865,0.135,in answering the question before the judge i explained my faith in christ and my personal relationship with him
17957,0.7239,0.171,0.492,0.337,the judge was visibly startled by such a bold statement from a prisoner whose freedom seemed so close at hand
17958,0.1531,0.0,0.822,0.178,aghasi you may present your defense to the court in the matter of apostasy
17959,0.7351,0.0,0.677,0.323, my clients respect other religions in the same way they respect their own mr
17960,0.4019,0.0,0.426,0.574,aghasi said hopefully
17961,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,mr
17962,0.6249,0.115,0.546,0.339,aghasi was doing his best to have us acquitted of the apostasy charges
17963,-0.4767,0.437,0.563,0.0,judge our lawyer is wrong
17964,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i felt all eyes in the room now fixed upon me
17965,-0.0516,0.21,0.588,0.202,if we had wanted to be freed by denying our faith we could have gotten out of prison months ago
17966,0.0516,0.0,0.87,0.13,we have to change some of the last sentences
17967,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, thats fine judge pirabbasi said
17968,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ive already told you what to expect if the charge of apostasy is proven
17969,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i will write that you say we believe in jesus christ
17970,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, our lawyers face was still red as a beet
17971,0.0,0.061,0.877,0.061,if they have reached this conclusion and believe in what they say then they will have to pay the price for it
17972,0.0516,0.083,0.827,0.091, maryam and i stepped forward to sign some papers acquitting us of the political charges and reaffirming our belief in jesus christ
17973,-0.0258,0.116,0.773,0.11,i have acquitted you of the political charges brought against you by the court of revolution
17974,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but with regard to the apostasy charge it must be dealt with by another court which is designed to look into these particular cases
17975,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, couldnt you handle this issue in your court too instead of referring it to another judge
17976,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, mr
17977,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,aghasi inquired
17978,-0.6583,0.25,0.661,0.089,you can check the law but im sure i have dealt appropriately with the first charges yet can be no further help on the second charge
17979,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, maryam asked the judge if we could have the letters that had been sent to us
17980,-0.34,0.107,0.893,0.0,we also asked about our laptops identity papers and other items that had been confiscated on the day of our arrest
17981,-0.4767,0.129,0.871,0.0,everything is probably at the gisha police station where you were arrested or in bureau 2 where you came to court before
17982,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, he called a clerk and instructed him to see if any of our belongings were there in bureau 26
17983,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the clerk left the courtroom and came back in a moment with two bibles
17984,-0.25,0.154,0.846,0.0,the judge walked out of the courtroom leaving us alone with mr
17985,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,aghasi
17986,-0.34,0.194,0.806,0.0,you are the first defendants ever to deny their lawyers statement
17987,0.3182,0.0,0.874,0.126,he has been recently transferred to the court of revolution and is responsible for the political cases
17988,0.4019,0.0,0.881,0.119,i wish that today he would have tied up your case file so that the apostasy judge could deliver his ruling
17989,0.25,0.152,0.633,0.215,unfortunately now your case will be referred to the court of justice
17990,0.2732,0.0,0.925,0.075, the judge came back into the courtroom and to our surprise he sat at the table with us and ordered his clerk to serve us tea
17991,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,mr
17992,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,aghasi said again to mr
17993,0.3818,0.0,0.776,0.224,pirabbasi that he wished the judge could resolve our case
17994,-0.5994,0.17,0.787,0.043,in serious cases that normally end with a sentence of life imprisonment or death this court the court of revolution does not get involved the judge said
17995,0.5267,0.0,0.793,0.207,those cases go to the court of justice where there is a threejudge panel
17996,0.0422,0.197,0.597,0.207,he asked about the conditions inside evin prison especially the medical care
17997,-0.4767,0.172,0.736,0.091,thank you but i dont think the prison staff would allow us to take this bottle into our ward i said

18002,0.0387,0.0,0.946,0.054,the smell made me want to add my own vomit to the situation but somehow i was able to control myself
18003,-0.5106,0.202,0.798,0.0,our appetites gone we gave our sandwiches to other prisoners waiting for the bus

18010,-0.25,0.167,0.833,0.0,everyone in ward 2 was anxious to know what had happened
18011,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,maybe theyll offer bail one of them said

18038,-0.5423,0.123,0.877,0.0,our visitor stepped out of the room for a few minutes to see another prisoner who knew him and had heard he was in the office
18039,-0.6486,0.227,0.773,0.0,while our guard was alone with us he asked are you the two christian prisoners who get all the mail
18040,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, yes we are
18041,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,several soldiers open and read them and then report the contents to the authorities

18044,-0.5106,0.096,0.904,0.0,i think in any case he will order that you get the letters after youve been released because there are so many of them and prisoners arent allowed to receive letters anyway
18045,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, by the time we returned to ward 2 our meeting with mr
18046,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ramezani had already made headlines
18047,-0.4588,0.111,0.889,0.0,some of the inmates remained jealous of the attention we received yet they all  wanted to know about our discussion and what would happen next
18048,-0.2937,0.091,0.851,0.058,we heard later that our visitor had stayed to talk with several other women prisoners after we left so as not to raise suspicions that he had come again only to see us
18049,-0.4939,0.127,0.873,0.0,when we reported to the office a guard from ward 209 was waiting to blindfold us and take us to that miserable place
18050,-0.552,0.158,0.842,0.0,it was very unusual for prisoners to return to 209 after their cases had been heard by the revolutionary court
18051,0.0772,0.0,0.929,0.071,fereshteh told us that it usually meant a prisoners sentence was either going to be extended or applied
18052,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,marziyeh and i walked to the other building peeking out from under the bottom of our blindfolds to watch our escorts feet as usual and waited in the hallway facing the wall
18053,-0.34,0.375,0.625,0.0,there must be some mistake
18054,-0.25,0.111,0.889,0.0, i was taken alone into a room with marziyeh left facing the wall in the hallway
18055,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,after the guard had left the room and shut the door behind him a voice told me to remove my blindfold
18056,-0.5574,0.203,0.729,0.068,didnt you know that those who renounce islam are considered apostates and their sentence is death
18057,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i met with jesus christ
18058,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you were also our guests here in ward 209 for a while
18059,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, something familiar about him registered in my mindi knew his voice
18060,-0.8818,0.454,0.436,0.111,so they arrested and imprisoned us just for fun and christian converts dont really face the death penalty
18061,-0.4927,0.189,0.811,0.0,obviously he was trying very hard to offset the mess others had made of our case with some syrupy language
18062,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,if you need anything all you have to do is ask
18063,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, mr
18064,0.7783,0.0,0.657,0.343,dolatabadi smiled and said i have the power to let you go free or not
18065,-0.4404,0.251,0.619,0.13,i believe it is the lords will that marziyeh and i should be in prison and that our freedom lies in his hands alone
18066,0.2263,0.074,0.753,0.173,of course we dont like staying in prison and we would rather be free but we prefer to wait for the lords decision on the matter
18067,-0.4588,0.375,0.625,0.0, i was irritated at mr
18068,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dolatabadis attitude and his remark that he had the power to release us
18069,0.4939,0.0,0.814,0.186,it reminded me of pontius pilates claim that he had the power to save jesus
18070,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,by the way have you ever been to rome
18071,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, no never
18072,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, then why is the vatican involved in your case
18073,-0.3818,0.161,0.759,0.079,however its only natural for the vatican to get involved with our case because we have been imprisoned on charges of being christians and believing in jesus
18074,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, we never learned any more about the vaticans reported involvement
18075,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in any case mr
18076,-0.2006,0.1,0.824,0.076,dolatabadi said you must have known that to convert to christianity and then promote it the way you have in this country is quite dangerous and subjects you to  execution
18077,-0.1779,0.332,0.358,0.309,the men offered us sweets and treated us like honored guests rather than prisoners threatened with death
18078,0.6486,0.0,0.813,0.187,clearly the vaticans involvement had brought the publicity in our case and the need to resolve it to a new level on an international scale
18079,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,mr
18080,0.25,0.066,0.838,0.096,dolatabadi asked lots of questions about conditions inside evinfood medical care our general healthas if he the citys chief prosecutor had no idea what went on in the citys prisons
18081,-0.7184,0.222,0.778,0.0,i started telling him about the ridiculous rule requiring every prisoner to go outside for the morning roll call regardless of her condition
18082,-0.8481,0.19,0.751,0.059,like everyone else we had talked to lately he was scrambling for a way to avoid an international crisis by persuading us to change our story about what had happened to us forget the mistreatment and relentless interrogations overlook the inhumane treatment and injustice believe that our mistreatment at the hands of mr
18083,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,sobhani mr
18084,0.7506,0.0,0.819,0.181,haddad our anonymous interrogators and everyone else was because of their personal actions and opinions not because they were acting in the name of the kindly compassionate and accommodating iranian regime
18085,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,after mr
18086,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dolatabadi finished his speech marziyeh and i were blindfolded and taken back to our ward
18087,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when they found out we had met with mr
18088,0.4019,0.0,0.863,0.137,dolatabadi they were convinced it was a prelude to our release and the final settlement of our case
18089,0.4019,0.0,0.856,0.144,we began to think they might be right that we actually were going to be freed soon
18090,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,within days we found ourselves blindfolded once again escorted to ward 209 and seated before mr
18091,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dolatabadi and his whitehaired companion
18092,0.2732,0.0,0.877,0.123,i have agreed to release you on bail until your trial begins the chief prosecutor said
18093,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,you will be released after posting bail of 200 million tomans about 100000 each
18094,0.4019,0.0,0.838,0.162, we dont have anyone who can help us raise that much money marziyeh said
18095,-0.5267,0.252,0.607,0.14,besides after nearly nine months in prison under these charges we want to see our case resolved
18096,-0.2732,0.116,0.884,0.0,we think the case should be settled instead of releasing us on bail while still under charges
18097,-0.1027,0.104,0.896,0.0, you wouldnt actually have to pay the bail the older man said
18098,0.4404,0.0,0.87,0.13,i can call them now and they can go straight to the courthouse to register their names on your behalf and their guarantee will serve as your bail
18099,0.2732,0.0,0.769,0.231, i have agreed to your freedom mr
18100,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dolatabadi added
18101,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we were blindfolded and left in the corridor waiting for our escort to take us back to the public ward
18102,-0.5859,0.215,0.699,0.086,the sight of the food amazed the guards in the ward 2 office who were used to seeing prisoners return from 209 exhausted and worried and sometimes bruised and bleeding
18103,0.0772,0.0,0.942,0.058,they didnt want us to go into the ward with our food so they sent us into the kitchen to eat it
18104,-0.5106,0.142,0.858,0.0,marziyeh and i split one container of food and gave the other to some other prisoners  who were in the room
18105,-0.5859,0.119,0.881,0.0,after wed eaten and were walking to our cell amiri the guard who had been so mean to me the night i got food poisoning called out to me
18106,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,mr
18107,-0.5106,0.163,0.837,0.0,dolatabadis brief phone call had ushered in a new world inside evin prison at least for the moment
18108,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,marziyeh the very next day our names were called again to go to ward 209
18109,0.8442,0.11,0.507,0.382,instead of fearing for our safety our friends were now convinced this summons was moving us yet another step closer to freedom
18110,-0.1027,0.101,0.78,0.118,parvaneh the prisoner who made a little money as the cleaner of our room asked for our autographs to prove she had shared a cell with two such famous people
18111,-0.296,0.167,0.833,0.0,others teased us goodnaturedly by shouting whats on the takeout menu today
18112,0.1027,0.0,0.851,0.149, and whos coming to apologize to you today
18113,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, we were blindfolded and taken to 209 where we waited in the corridor facing the wall until we were led into a room
18114,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i hear you are being freed he said
18115,0.7172,0.069,0.788,0.143,im not sure whether you believe me or not but i want you to know that my colleagues and i were heavily involved in pursuing your case and did our best to get you released
18116,0.6908,0.1,0.588,0.312,dont you ever think that it was international pressure or the church that secured your freedom
18117,0.0516,0.096,0.8,0.104,you were just unlucky that your arrest coincided with the nowruz holidays and after that we had the election and its aftermath
18118,-0.2263,0.192,0.808,0.0,all these events delayed the processing of your case
18119,-0.1027,0.113,0.887,0.0,who is going to pay your bail or stand as your guarantor
18120,-0.2924,0.267,0.733,0.0, its not clear yet maryam said
18121,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,our lawyer is looking into it
18122,0.5859,0.0,0.593,0.407, well god willing you will soon be freed
18123,0.0754,0.094,0.779,0.127,if in the past as you say you didnt know that such things as promoting the message of jesus and his prophecies are illegal in this country now you know it very well
18124,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,i hear the chief prosecutor has been to see you and youre about to be freed
18125,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, yes

18129,0.3612,0.0,0.706,0.294, we promised to contact him later
18130,0.5106,0.0,0.769,0.231,the guard standing nearby said so you are to be set free
18131,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, yes
18132,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, what was your charge
18133,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, believing in jesus christ
18134,0.5574,0.0,0.465,0.535, well thank god for that
18135,0.5423,0.0,0.667,0.333, she and another guard stared in amazement
18136,0.2732,0.125,0.676,0.199,it was probably  the first time the head of the security section had called a prisoner to congratulate her on her release
18137,-0.5423,0.368,0.632,0.0,when maryam told another prisoner that mr
18138,-0.25,0.153,0.741,0.106,ramezani had called us the woman joked now its president ahmadinejads turn to come visit you in prison
18139,-0.6369,0.282,0.57,0.149, while the final chapters of our story were playing out other prisoners were hearing news both good and bad about their charges
18140,0.656,0.0,0.786,0.214,reihanehs case was also in bureau 26 with judge pirabbasi who had been so kind to us
18141,0.0,0.152,0.739,0.109,the judge had encouraged her to end her hunger strike and had offered her something to eat in his courtroom
18142,0.5423,0.0,0.759,0.241,she was soon released on bail and joyfully reunited with her family
18143,0.7964,0.0,0.628,0.372,our freedom must not be the end of our friendship with you i said
18144,0.6369,0.0,0.658,0.342,youve promised to get in touch with us whenever you are freed
18145,0.8328,0.045,0.626,0.33,no matter how long it takes we will be waiting to hear from you and celebrate your freedom
18146,-0.0258,0.14,0.723,0.136, after the comings and goings of prisoners over the months our closest remaining friend was shirin alam hooli
18147,0.6124,0.145,0.608,0.247,hearing of her friends execution had been a terrible blow and now we her best remaining friends were about to leave her
18148,0.25,0.0,0.833,0.167,the last big hurdle seemed to be arranging the bail guarantee
18149,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we were on the phone to our sisters every day working out the situation
18150,-0.4268,0.187,0.736,0.077,because they had no personal wealth they had found two welltodo businessmen who owned property and were willing to guarantee our bail
18151,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but this time mr
18152,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dolatabadis secretary told them they could come back and see mr
18153,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ghotbi another judge in the revolutionary court and he would handle our case
18154,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he said that as an alternative our lawyer mr
18155,0.25,0.0,0.667,0.333,aghasi could sign our guarantee
18156,-0.1027,0.137,0.781,0.082,under the circumstances they agreed to take the risk even though they wouldnt be able to pay the bail if it became necessary
18157,-0.5994,0.149,0.851,0.0,of course you are aware that i am allowed by our religious law to cut you in half with a sword right now he fumed at them his voice rising
18158,-0.0516,0.107,0.893,0.0,but i prefer to leave it to the law to decide
18159,0.5106,0.0,0.845,0.155, he explained that he would now send a letter to evin instructing the warden to set us free
18160,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the charge of apostasy was still pending but at least we could be on the outside until the trial
18161,-0.5859,0.151,0.849,0.0,as we had learned from following our friends cases it often happens in iranian courts that prisoners are released on bail but the charges are never settled or dropped
18162,-0.296,0.109,0.891,0.0,that way the accused still have a case open against them and can be rearrested on the flimsiest pretext
18163,-0.5106,0.202,0.798,0.0,every night we wondered whether this would be our last night in evin prison
18164,0.836,0.084,0.608,0.309,never in our lives would we form friendships as deep and rich as the ones god had blessed us with behind the high and foreboding walls of evin prison
18165,-0.2023,0.101,0.899,0.0,the word evin wasnt strange to us anymore it was now as familiar as our own names
18166,-0.5106,0.121,0.879,0.0,i wonder if ill ever see the whole sky again instead of only a piece of it framed by a window or a prison wall
18167,-0.7579,0.273,0.727,0.0, she looked around the courtyard with the sad stump where the lone tree had been the wet ground the numbingly familiar walls
18168,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i wished that shirins case could be settled before we left
18169,-0.7684,0.301,0.58,0.119,but we were united forever in standing against the injustice that has destroyed the body and soul of the iranian people
18170,-0.2263,0.224,0.572,0.204,our greatest wish our fondest dream was that iran would shake off the chains of its evil rulers and that the people of iran would be delivered from injustice and dictatorship
18171,-0.8766,0.369,0.562,0.069,only god knew whether he was finished with us in ward 2 room 1 of irans most feared and brutal prison
18172,-0.4215,0.137,0.863,0.0,after breakfast when inmates usually left for the cultural center no one on the ward wanted to go because they were afraid to miss our departure
18173,-0.296,0.196,0.661,0.143,but because prisoners were never released before noon we encouraged everybody to go to their morning activities
18174,0.4019,0.0,0.769,0.231,if only they could all be freed before we were
18175,0.6369,0.0,0.606,0.394,what do you feel like now that youre being freed
18176,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, she asked
18177,0.3182,0.206,0.496,0.298,think about your freedom and dont worry about me
18178,0.6369,0.0,0.756,0.244,your freedom papers have arrived she shouted as she threw herself into my arms
18179,0.4767,0.0,0.819,0.181,a few minutes later our names were announced and the whole ward burst into cheers
18180,0.875,0.0,0.56,0.44,now friends from all over the ward swarmed into our room to hug us and wish us well
18181,-0.5423,0.143,0.857,0.0,then the women began to sing the song we sang whenever a political prisoner was released go go and never come back
18182,0.4939,0.0,0.814,0.186, i heard the sound of a plate shattering on the floor in our honor
18183,-0.0772,0.049,0.951,0.0,there was nothing left to do but walk through the corridor and out of the ward yet marziyeh and i could scarcely bring ourselves to leave
18184,0.765,0.0,0.664,0.336,we carried our things from the cell into the corridor still hugging and kissing everyone we could reach
18185,-0.5106,0.171,0.829,0.0,at the end of the hall the guards told the other prisoners they couldnt walk any farther
18186,0.6369,0.0,0.802,0.198,how we would have given anything to take shirin with us on those few final steps to freedom

18592,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,sometimes the men shot out one question after another so quickly i hardly had time to reflect on my answers
18593,0.4588,0.0,0.85,0.15,this was most conspicuously the case with my book which appeared to be their main object of interest

18640,0.0258,0.122,0.789,0.09,then i would leap into a dumpster like a fugitive in the movies mixing with the rats while the two agents ran by me unaware

18658,-0.5859,0.19,0.736,0.074,if i really was such a threat to national security it didnt make sense that my captors would wait to detain me until just before my departure
18659,-0.1779,0.078,0.861,0.061,they could have easily arrested me months or years earlier at the tehran airport when i was making one of my frequent trips as they sometimes did to academics and activists entering or leaving the country
18660,-0.7425,0.399,0.601,0.0,then javan spoke his voice lower now miss saberi your crime is very serious

19201,0.0516,0.164,0.688,0.148,i was dismayed by the thought that i would have to keep waiting for my freedom and that my family bahman and any friends who realized i had disappeared almost one month earlier would have to agonize even longer
19202,0.4019,0.0,0.787,0.213,well i thought i was supposed to be freed by now
19203,0.5927,0.0,0.832,0.168, weve been working on it but these things take time he said as if i should have known better
19204,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we make the decisions around here

19208,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he even informed me that the most accurate translation for the farsi word mahramâneh was not secret as i had thought but classified
19209,0.1531,0.084,0.811,0.105, one new question had to do with whether before my detention i had noticed any signs that the intelligence ministry was monitoring me so closely
19210,-0.5574,0.161,0.839,0.0,i told javan and haj agha that i had not although after my arrest i had begun to think about the signals i may have missed
19211,-0.3071,0.138,0.862,0.0,this was the first time during my incarceration that my captors had made this accusation
19212,-0.25,0.163,0.736,0.101,others had defied the regimes restrictions on the press and free speech by writing personal blogs or contributing to foreign news web sitesdespite the risk of punishment
19213,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but why did you report on sensitive topics such as aids in iran
19214,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, his question made me wonder whether he had ever read watched or listened to any of my work
19215,-0.5106,0.093,0.907,0.0,he had added however that whether and when the concentrated epidemic found among intravenous drug users and prisoners spread to sex workers homosexuals and the youth completely depended on the countrys future policies
19216,-0.34,0.112,0.888,0.0,and it was people with this kind of mindset i lamented who held so much power in the islamic republic
19217,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,javan stood up to take me back to my cell
19218,-0.7351,0.237,0.698,0.064,you should remember he said in a threatening tone if you leave this place and tell anyone about our arrangement be sure i will sign your death warrant myself
19219,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  back in my cell i cast off my chador and sank onto my blankets
19220,0.5367,0.17,0.548,0.282,after so many unfulfilled promises it seemed i would really be freed this time yet i was in no mood to rejoice
19221,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i turned my back to them and stared at the wall
19222,0.4404,0.072,0.767,0.16,i was vacillating between a feeling of hope that i would finally be freed and the idea that once released i would have to live in fear of haj agha and his henchmen wherever i happened to be
19223,0.8047,0.162,0.431,0.407,but mostly i felt deep shame at the way i was winning my freedom
19224,-0.8235,0.251,0.694,0.055,vida and nargess had gone through three police dramas by the time i came to a realization that i had been struggling to avoid since my first week in prison i did not want to be freed for telling lies
19225,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the magistrate was at his desk in his office on the second floor of the courthouse exactly how i had first seen him nearly one month earlier
19226,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i hadnt expected to be brought here just two days after my last interrogation much earlier than haj agha had predicted
19227,0.6369,0.0,0.816,0.184,then i remembered how nearly two weeks earlier my guard had told the magistrates assistant that my interrogator had promised me i would be freed
19228,-0.2705,0.241,0.598,0.161,if i ignored haj aghas warning and told the magistrate that my interrogators made me confess to crimes i did not commit i might lose my chance at freedom
19229,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,besides all these men were intertwined in one way or another so how could the magistrate not know the answer to his own question
19230,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i wont tell them
19231,0.6334,0.0,0.77,0.23, he looked at me intensely but without hostility triggering a tugofwar in my head
19232,-0.296,0.136,0.864,0.0,he was the man who had thrown me into solitary and refused me a lawyer
19233,-0.5106,0.32,0.68,0.0,havent other prisoners been asked to do that
19234,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i asked
19235,0.4678,0.034,0.874,0.092,i found it hard to believe he wasnt aware of such arrangements but i said they said i have to spy on foreign diplomats in iran and on americans abroador something like that

19239,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i didnt know what to say
19240,0.714,0.116,0.649,0.235,well yyes i stammered it would be risky but my interrogators said this was the price of my freedom
19241,0.4419,0.066,0.747,0.187, i thought it prudent not to admit that once freed i would have never upheld my end of the bargain
19242,-0.128,0.073,0.927,0.0,the magistrate lowered his gaze to his desk and began drumming his pen on a blank notepad softly and slowly
19243,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then the magistrate asked if i had any property deeds i could put up for bail
19244,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he waved the guard over to take me away
19245,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,could i call my parents and tell them where i am
19246,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, he blinked
19247,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dont they know
19248,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i explained that my interrogators had told me to lie to them about where i was
19249,0.4019,0.0,0.748,0.252,they said if i didnt i wouldnt be freed
19250,-0.6908,0.281,0.719,0.0,  if they told you to kill someone would you do that too
19251,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i was beginning to think this man might actually have some principles
19252,-0.7269,0.225,0.775,0.0,as the guard drove me back to prison i started to regret that i hadnt also told the magistrate my confession was false
19253,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when i arrived at the womens ward i asked haj khanom if i could be taken back to the magistrate
19254,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,did they hit you
19255,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the three of us wanted to know once our new cellmate sara had arranged her blankets in the middle of the floor
19256,-0.4767,0.162,0.838,0.0,sara told us she was arrested early that morning with her fiancé and two of her girlfriends
19257,-0.34,0.179,0.821,0.0,saras fiancé had resisted arrest so the men started to beat him
19258,0.0258,0.075,0.848,0.077,eventually the agents collected the four friends and forced them into a van which was parked so close to the apartment complexs front door that the only way out of the building was into the vehicle
19259,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,now her two girlfriends were in another cell while her fiancé had been taken to the mens ward of 209
19260,0.0,0.099,0.803,0.099,they were active in a leftist student group had taken part in university demonstrations and several of their classmates had been detained before them
19261,-0.1027,0.068,0.877,0.055,imprisonment i knew was one risk iranian students faced for political activism which had been growing increasingly dangerousespecially after hardliners expanded their control over universities following ahmadinejads 2005 victory
19262,0.8074,0.0,0.767,0.233,although still loyal to the islamic republics main tenets it turned against conservatives and transformed into a proponent of civil society pluralism and freedom of expression
19263,-0.2023,0.083,0.917,0.0,the next day sunday march 1 sara was taken to court and charged with having links to communist opposition groups abroad
19264,0.4767,0.0,0.744,0.256,their two friends however were to be released on bail
19265,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,she said she had learned from some classmates what to expect in jail
19266,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then she had parried you must be a member too
19267,-0.0227,0.053,0.897,0.05, first roya then silva and nargess and now this twentyyearold student had used a variety of methods to resist their captors demands to lie or to admit to crimes they did not commit
19268,0.7003,0.146,0.543,0.311,they had stood up to threats and pressures knowing that by telling the truth and proclaiming their innocence they could jeopardize their chances at freedom
19269,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do your parents know where you are
19270,0.3612,0.0,0.839,0.161, i asked sara wondering if her family like mine was in the dark
19271,-0.4767,0.22,0.78,0.0,my brother was arrested last year and was later released on bail
19272,0.6808,0.0,0.769,0.231,after that we decided that in case i was next he should call me every night at a certain time to make sure im ok
19273,-0.4019,0.162,0.838,0.0,if my phone is turned off at that time he should assume ive been detained
19274,-0.6124,0.111,0.889,0.0, sara was concerned however that her parents would be terrified their daughter was now reliving their sons ordeal so that afternoon she asked the guard on duty if she could call them
19275,-0.2987,0.139,0.76,0.101,when haj khanom brought breakfast to our cell on tuesday morning sara pushed aside the tray and flatly announced i want no breakfast no lunch and no dinner
19276,0.0772,0.0,0.874,0.126,you cant get what you want here by not eating
19277,0.0516,0.081,0.856,0.062, i had never witnessed anyone go on a hunger strike although i had met and reported on akbar ganji a famous iranian political dissident who had been freed from evin in 2006 after fasting for more than seventy days
19278,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he later went abroad where he continued to speak out for the movement of democracy in iran
19279,-0.3919,0.252,0.614,0.134,but because no one outside evin knew of saras strike it was difficult to predict how effective the move would be for her
19280,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i sat facing the wall with my eyes bound in the interrogation room where javan had summoned me one day later that week
19281,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,does he know where i am
19282,-0.4767,0.128,0.872,0.0, even if he didnt know he must have decided he could no longer stay quietignoring what i had been pressured to tell him by phone nearly three weeks earlier
19283,-0.3252,0.143,0.857,0.0,the interrogator answered my question with an order his noise is not helpful for you
19284,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dont tell him where you are
19285,0.7845,0.0,0.78,0.22,on the other hand media attention if thats what my father was drumming up could compel them to free me soonerthat is if they even admitted to having me in custody
19286,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in any case my interrogator was telling me to lie once again
19287,-0.2732,0.116,0.884,0.0,i heard a pen drop onto my desk followed by the swoosh of a piece of paper
19288,0.0772,0.0,0.885,0.115,write i dont want to call my father and sign it
19289,0.3818,0.0,0.874,0.126, i lifted my blindfold picked up the pen and wrote i dont want to call my father unless i am allowed to tell him the truth
19290,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,without another word to me he instructed a guard to return me to my cell
19291,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,since she had joined our cell she had begun to appear healthier
19292,-0.765,0.286,0.714,0.0,her eyes were no longer puffy from crying and she had regained some of the weight she had lost in solitary confinement
19293,0.9314,0.0,0.52,0.48,but if the only way i can go free is to lie then freedom has little value
19294,0.7269,0.0,0.413,0.587,i will pray to god to help you
19295,0.4767,0.0,0.849,0.151, then she released my hands tenderly ran her fingers across the koran and asked do you want me to do an estekhâre for you
19296,0.2263,0.0,0.921,0.079, estekhâre i had learned years before was a muslim tradition of divining answers to questions in this case by consulting the koran
19297,-0.4019,0.109,0.891,0.0,the practice was fairly common in iran where many people turned to fortunetellers for answers to their personal and financial questions and problems
19298,-0.7561,0.242,0.686,0.071,i immediately made two that no one would ever be harmed because of the falsehoods i had told in this prison and that i would be freed within the week
19299,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,how did you know
19300,0.5423,0.0,0.759,0.241, nargess smiled as if the answer to my question was obvious
19301,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,make another wishthis time only one
19302,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153, i paused deliberating over whether instead of making a wish i should ask a question
19303,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,may i pose a question instead
19304,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i asked nargess
19305,-0.6908,0.226,0.774,0.0,my entire dilemma i realized  rested on whether i should let my lies persist or put a stop to them while i was still in jail
19306,0.6597,0.127,0.482,0.392,in short should i risk my freedom to pursue the truth
19307,0.0772,0.0,0.951,0.049,she recited some more verses opened the koran again ran her eyes over the page on the left side and read the last sentence to herself
19308,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,finally she looked up and said with conviction do it
19309,-0.872,0.334,0.603,0.063,tears started to roll down my cheeks as i realized that i had given up the truth on account of fear of man and fear of death
19310,0.6369,0.0,0.851,0.149,at last i understood that i had to tell the truth even if it cost me my freedom even if it cost me my life
19311,-0.6096,0.18,0.745,0.075,the yard was insulting sara declared and it existed only so that prison officials could announce to the world they were humane enough to give us an opportunity for outdoor exercise
19312,0.128,0.096,0.759,0.145,a simple phone call to her family which should have been every detainees right was a privilege that sara was prepared to starve herself to obtain
19313,-0.0258,0.184,0.638,0.177,then it began to ache pleading with me to soothe it
19314,-0.5478,0.149,0.851,0.0,by the fourth day saturday it had begun to adjust to its deprivations and except for an occasional grumble had resigned itself to quietly awaiting its unknown future
19315,0.3182,0.0,0.947,0.053,the family had dropped me off at the train station the next day after making me promise to return someday to travel with them to their small cottage in the north of iran where we would pick the most succulent wild berries
19316,0.5574,0.0,0.0,1.0,thank god
19317,-0.6124,0.135,0.865,0.0, she had just come back that saturday march 7 from court where she had wept before her magistrate swearing that she was not a spy and had never done anything even remotely political
19318,-0.34,0.07,0.93,0.0,the magistrate had decided as he had once before to release nargess on bail and she had been permitted to call her family for the first time since her arrest several weeks earlier
19319,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the court would keep the deed to her home until her trial whenever that might take placeif ever
19320,0.8957,0.0,0.638,0.362,despite these fibs sara was happy to have spoken to her parents and she returned to our cell with an exultant grin
19321,0.6486,0.0,0.43,0.57,for them freedom seemed within reach
19322,-0.34,0.059,0.941,0.0,the last thing i wanted to do was spoil my cellmates high spirits so i pressed the black button by our door and waited as glasses the guard who had been on duty the night of my arrest appeared
19323,-0.6486,0.201,0.799,0.0,i leaned my back against the wall buried my face in my hands and released my tearstears of helplessness of guilt of a profound longing for my family
19324,-0.631,0.196,0.804,0.0,but instead she said softly if youre going to cry at least do it in the next room
19325,-0.4404,0.094,0.906,0.0, the next room was the size of one cell where two big potted plants a large trash bin and a water fountain sat on a dirty tiled floor
19326,-0.5106,0.093,0.907,0.0,that was where my fellow prisoners and i were allowed to fill our plastic water bottles and throw out our garbagetasks we often competed over to break the monotony of our daily lives
19327,-0.5106,0.355,0.645,0.0,do some prisoners stay here for years
19328,-0.4215,0.259,0.741,0.0, i asked struggling to get the words out

19332,0.6369,0.0,0.88,0.12, it was sunday march 8 the day that haj agha had said i would be sent to the magistrates office where if i wanted to be freed i should repeat my confession and agree to everything the magistrate said
19333,-0.5423,0.149,0.851,0.0,a male guard loaded me into a van where he handcuffed me to a young woman prisoner i hadnt seen before
19334,-0.5106,0.248,0.752,0.0,two male prisoners sat in front of us also shackled together
19335,-0.5106,0.125,0.875,0.0,dont speak to one another the guard ordered from the passenger seat before we headed out the prison gate and toward the revolutionary court
19336,0.4939,0.0,0.868,0.132,please give me the strength to tell the truth i murmured to myself with my eyes closed whatever the result might be
19337,-0.4215,0.091,0.909,0.0, the guard began to say something to me but the driver who must have glimpsed at me in his rearview mirror interrupted him and said let her be

19339,0.9001,0.0,0.7,0.3, with my free hand i drew my chador over my face and continued whispering over and over please give me the strength to tell the truth whatever the result might be
19340,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, when we arrived at the court about thirty minutes later the guard unlocked our handcuffs and led us to the second floor
19341,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,with his outdated suit stooped shoulders and stubble on his chin the only thing that gave him the aura of a lawyer was his leather briefcase
19342,-0.7506,0.252,0.748,0.0,my guard admonished the man for talking to me and took the other woman prisoner and me into the magistrates office
19343,-0.7269,0.203,0.797,0.0,for the next half hour or so i waited as the magistrate interrogated my fellow prisoner by having her write down answers to his written questions
19344,-0.4215,0.137,0.863,0.0,through the few words they exchanged i gathered that the woman had been in solitary confinement for twenty days and was charged with propaganda against islam
19345,0.4019,0.0,0.847,0.153,after the questions finished the magistrate told her she would be freed on bail that day
19346,0.4404,0.0,0.805,0.195,she thanked him and the guard took her to sit in the hallway
19347,-0.128,0.068,0.874,0.058,the magistrate asked me why i had once spoken to the japanese ambassador to tehran at a dinner party why i had traveled to lebanon and why i had tried to assist my jailed acquaintanceall questions repeated from my interrogations five weeks earlier
19348,0.4939,0.0,0.873,0.127,after i wrote each answer he would read it then write down a new question on another sheet and hand it to me
19349,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,how is the state of ohio
19350,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, he asked without altering his tone

19362,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what i said in my interrogation about mr
19363,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,d was false because whenever i told my interrogators the truththat i was not a spy and was simply writing a book about iran and that this was a personal project not funded by any individual institution or governmentthey told me they didnt believe me and that i wasnt cooperating
19364,-0.3089,0.117,0.883,0.0,i deduced from my interrogators words that i would not be freed unless i told this false story
19365,-0.5994,0.426,0.426,0.149,out of fear i agreed to state those lies
19366,-0.7845,0.289,0.711,0.0,without speaking the magistrate held out a tissue box as if he was used to dealing with distraught prisoners
19367,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they must have taken at least three or four hours
19368,0.2263,0.0,0.905,0.095,only after the interrogation was complete did the magistrate allow me to speak to khorramshahi for a few minutes
19369,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,who found you for me
19370,-0.3818,0.302,0.698,0.0, i asked the lawyer with suspicion
19371,0.5994,0.0,0.588,0.412,one of your mutual friends recommended me to him
19372,0.2846,0.0,0.95,0.05, i still didnt know whether to trust this man and it was disquieting to have heard he didnt usually cover political cases but when he told me to sign a form retaining him as my lawyer i did as he said
19373,0.4019,0.0,0.909,0.091,i then asked him to go to my apartment find the deed even if i wouldnt be freed on bail any time soon and take out the garbage
19374,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dont say his name loudly here
19375,-0.5267,0.099,0.901,0.0, i couldnt discern whether khorramshahi meant that talking about bahman would put bahman me or the lawyer himself in danger even though my interrogators already knew about the two of us
19376,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,its time for you to go the magistrate said motioning at the guard to take me away
19377,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,please tell my parents where i am i told khorramshahi before getting up
19378,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the guard led me to the hallway and sat me down next to the other woman detainee
19379,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,she and i were to wait here for the two male prisoners who had come to court with us
19380,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the guard again ordered us not to speak to each other then positioned himself on a chair a few seats away
19381,-0.6908,0.588,0.412,0.0,what crime are you accused of
19382,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the woman whispered
19383,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i glanced at the guard
19384,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he had busied himself with talking to another guard
19385,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the detainee introduced her as her sister
19386,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,on the way back to evin the detainees sister joined us in the van
19387,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,oddly the guard handcuffed me to her
19388,-0.3182,0.108,0.892,0.0,looking out the window i took in scenes i had been too unsettled to notice on my way to court
19389,0.5574,0.0,0.753,0.247,it was the fettered hand of the detainees sister who had reached out to grasp mine
19390,0.5574,0.0,0.723,0.277,she kept clutching my hand our palms wet with sweat until we reached evin
19391,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when i arrived at my cell i felt much lighter
19392,-0.7844,0.298,0.702,0.0,i had no idea whether retracting my confession that day meant i would be stuck in jail for many years but i no longer cared
19393,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,my parents knew where i was and the media were covering my story which made my execution highly unlikely
19394,0.5106,0.0,0.858,0.142,though still incarcerated i now felt liberated as if i had transformed into the sparrows shadow and finally set myself free
19395,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had learned that if the guards didnt inform us of our destinations it was an exercise in futility to ask
19396,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,javan was waiting for me outside the womens ward
19397,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where are we going
19398,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i asked
19399,-0.34,0.124,0.876,0.0,this was none other than the gang that had ransacked my apartment on the day of my arrest
19400,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,javan handed me my keys and told me to open the door to the building
19401,-0.1027,0.097,0.903,0.0,he didnt warn me to act naturally in case we came upon any neighbors
19402,0.0772,0.106,0.773,0.121,for some reason just like the last time no one was in sightnot even gholam the building caretaker
19403,-0.34,0.194,0.806,0.0,it also appeared that someone had been here since my arrest
19404,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,find us the money and the rest of those documents you told us you got from the center for strategic research javan ordered
19405,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,give me the one on the u
19406,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,s
19407,-0.5994,0.494,0.506,0.0,war in iraq he said
19408,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then he took me to the living room where his three associates were lounging on my furniture
19409,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he placed a pen and a sheaf of paper on the counter separating the living room from the kitchen
19410,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i picked up the pen and started writing this 2100 is what is remaining of the 15000 i received fromi couldnt do this
19411,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i set down the pen looked down and crossed my arms
19412,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,because when i told you the truththat i was just writing a book on my ownyou said you didnt believe me and that i wasnt cooperating
19413,0.7003,0.081,0.636,0.284, you pressured me to lie and promised me freedom only if i acted according to your demands
19414,0.3182,0.0,0.777,0.223, so why are you telling the truth now
19415,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, he asked
19416,0.3612,0.0,0.872,0.128,he extended the pen toward me and said then write that down you are ready to be executed
19417,-0.296,0.216,0.784,0.0, i refuse to write that i said emphatically
19418,0.128,0.092,0.795,0.113,i made it up under pressure because my interrogators had told me it was the only way i would be freed
19419,0.4939,0.0,0.842,0.158,he read it then said darkly dont think that the world will care if you stay in jail
19420,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i asked them if i could bring back to evin a photo of my family a little iranian money and a few books
19421,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in the car on the way back to evin i reflected on javans words we knew from the very beginning that it was a lie
19422,-0.6808,0.259,0.741,0.0, i wondered how often my captors and their colleagues deliberately made false accusations against other prisoners too
19423,-0.4215,0.135,0.865,0.0,and if the authorities had known i wasnt a spy why did they detain me in the first place
19424,-0.0258,0.068,0.867,0.065,they could also use my confession to reinforce their claim that america had planted spies throughout iran and to bolster their argument for more restrictions on society in the name of protecting national security
19425,0.25,0.128,0.698,0.173,in addition my captors could use my detention to solidify their support among antiamerican hardliners and to scare other dual nationals writers and journalists in iran as well as iranians advocating better relations with the west
19426,-0.8126,0.181,0.779,0.04,the more i considered these various possibilities the more i believed that what i had witnessed over the previous several weeks boiled down to an issue of power certain people in power were exploiting that power to suppress individuals who they feared were threatening it
19427,0.2023,0.0,0.859,0.141,call your parents a man commanded me and tell them youre fine
19428,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, early that morning i had been instructed to put on my chador to go to court again
19429,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,blindfolded i had been led downstairs where a man whose voice i didnt recognize gave me my cell phone
19430,0.4019,0.0,0.891,0.109,inform your parents you are going to court today and that youll be freed in two to three days he was telling me
19431,0.4019,0.0,0.903,0.097,they told me to tell you im going to be taken to court today and that im supposed to be freed in two to three days
19432,0.2115,0.105,0.746,0.149, then without heeding the guards order i added but im not sure if thats true
19433,0.4019,0.0,0.787,0.213, but we also heard that you will be freed soon
19434,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, really
19435,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i still couldnt believe this news
19436,0.3147,0.081,0.776,0.143,i made some statements during my interrogation that were not true but yesterday i finally told the truth
19437,0.4019,0.0,0.876,0.124,we are doing as much as we can to help you and the state department has called for your release
19438,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the state department
19439,0.1027,0.0,0.865,0.135, i hadnt realized my case had reached that level
19440,-0.8555,0.253,0.622,0.124,it was comforting to know i had such support but i also hated to think that my detention may have created new tensions between the two countries when the possibility of rapprochement had been looking more likely
19441,0.1531,0.0,0.652,0.348,spiritually and psychologically challenging
19442,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, the guard was gesturing at me to hang up
19443,0.2023,0.0,0.526,0.474,ill be fine
19444,-0.2263,0.083,0.917,0.0, as soon as i handed my cell phone to the guard he demanded to know why i hadnt followed his instructions
19445,0.8519,0.0,0.712,0.288,in any case your interrogator and haj agha said they apologized that it took so long for you to be freed but they did their best
19446,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i nodded
19447,0.7076,0.0,0.505,0.495,so i truly was going to be freed
19448,-0.5106,0.18,0.82,0.0,the guard led me to a van outside section 209 where several male prisoners were waiting
19449,0.228,0.0,0.929,0.071,the weather had become a little warmer and the guard in the passenger seat let us crack open the windows when we got onto the highway
19450,0.1779,0.0,0.946,0.054,the guard had brought me to the security division at court but instead of going to the magistrates office i had been dropped off in a spacious room on the right
19451,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then without any introduction the older man started grilling me about where i had grown up why i had come to iran whom i had reported for while in iran why i had a tendency to write antiregime reports though he didnt give me any examples and several questions about the book i was writing
19452,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i answered although i couldnt comprehend what my lawyer was for when he was absent for yet another interrogation
19453,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the list of questions continued for some minutes until the older man brought up the tale of mr
19454,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,d
19455,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,my confession about mr
19456,0.4019,0.0,0.881,0.119,d was false i explained adding that i had been told i had to make it in order to be freed
19457,0.2846,0.0,0.882,0.118,well the older man began i was going to free you but i decided not to anymore
19458,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, why not
19459,0.1779,0.0,0.892,0.108, because last night your lawyer did two interviews with the media he replied casually
19460,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they make statements to publicize themselves
19461,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i dont know whether mr
19462,-0.4588,0.158,0.842,0.0,khorramshahi did interviews i said but even if he did why should i be punished for it
19463,-0.3182,0.119,0.881,0.0, he ignored my question and continued did you speak to him yesterday when you were with mr
19464,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,sobhani
19465,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, sobhani must have been the magistrate
19466,0.4019,0.0,0.876,0.124,that morning i had been told i was going to be freed and now i was hearing just the opposite
19467,0.6474,0.0,0.816,0.184,but whoever this man was he seemed to be more influential than anyone else i had encountered during my imprisonment
19468,-0.4215,0.195,0.714,0.091,whenever i decide to free you he went on i probably wont let you leave the country for a while until the media frenzy over your case has died down
19469,0.3182,0.079,0.786,0.135, i knew that if he kept me in iran the intelligence ministry could continue to monitor and intimidate me
19470,-0.0258,0.152,0.702,0.146,haddad is the man whom university students like to criticize for jailing their classmates
19471,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, haddad shrugged as if this accomplishment was all in a days work
19472,0.4497,0.0,0.891,0.109,you may think my research and reporting are reason enough to keep me in jail but what i said here today was the complete truth
19473,0.1655,0.0,0.924,0.076, haddad listened calmly but when he began speaking a cloud passed over his face why is it that the u
19474,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,s
19475,-0.4019,0.105,0.895,0.0,has guantánamo bay and abu ghraib yet when we imprison an american woman for one month the world cries out violation of human rights
19476,-0.4404,0.146,0.854,0.0, by referring to these places haddad seemed to be taking his resentment against america out on me
19477,-0.5849,0.226,0.774,0.0,iran and other muslim countries had been particularly outraged by graphic reports of u
19478,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,s
19479,-0.743,0.441,0.559,0.0,soldiers abusing detainees at iraqs abu ghraib prison in 2004
19480,-0.7579,0.263,0.673,0.064,tehran often brought up these reports as well as allegations of torture at the american detention camp at guantánamo bay when it accused washington of hypocrisy
19481,-0.25,0.168,0.714,0.117,in the van on the way back to evin my fellow prisoners joked with one another
19482,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,back in my cell i told my cellmates about my encounter with haddad
19483,0.5574,0.0,0.859,0.141,he worked under saeed mortazavi the infamous hardline prosecutor general of tehran who was said to get his orders from the supreme leader

19485,0.7003,0.0,0.691,0.309,it went something like you roxana saberi will be free don 5 billion rials bail
19486,0.5499,0.0,0.772,0.228,but this time i was not only being told i would be freed
19487,0.2263,0.0,0.899,0.101,i would have to give the court a deed to property worth 5 billion rials or around 500000
19488,0.5719,0.0,0.761,0.239,my fathers apartment wasnt worth that much but maybe the court would agree to reduce my bail
19489,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,back in my cell i had not yet removed my chador when braces again appeared at the door
19490,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had a meeting with my attorney to discuss my bail she informed me

19492,-0.34,0.118,0.882,0.0, i struggled to keep track of the zeros as i calculated the amount in dollars in my head
19493,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had never heard of such a high bail in iran
19494,-0.5106,0.088,0.912,0.0,khorramshahi was waiting for me when a male guard took me to a small building just inside the prison gate and into a room filled with several cubicles where lawyers were meeting with their clients

19496,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, he hunched toward me and said in a barely audible voice the authorities might monitor me

19501,0.0387,0.0,0.956,0.044,i asked for khorramshahis cell phone number but he didnt have a pen and had to borrow one from a lawyer in the booth behind us

19507,-0.5267,0.254,0.746,0.0,if that was the case haddad had been lying to me
19508,0.9042,0.0,0.446,0.554,to celebrate my impending freedom i decided to attempt to beautify myself

19516,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, that was impossible i told her because i was to be released on bail within the next few days

19707,0.0258,0.0,0.945,0.055,i couldnt start all over with another lawyer whom the authorities might prevent from seeing my file or meor both
19708,0.296,0.0,0.891,0.109,i also didnt know if khorramshahi would share what little he knew about my case with a new lawyer
19709,-0.34,0.055,0.945,0.0,this was the courtroom where i had been brought two weeks after my arrest and the man sitting behind the raised desk at the opposite end was the whitebearded whiteturbaned judge who had asked if i had been in contact with foreigners

19738,-0.5719,0.198,0.802,0.0,when he paused i tried to defend myself but the judge broke in with another question
19739,0.1027,0.158,0.675,0.168,i was trying to say that the confession was false i made it because i was threatened with many years in prison if i didnt and promised freedom if i did

19750,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he pulled a few articles out of the folder and asked where i had received them
19751,-0.4215,0.104,0.896,0.0,his name had come up in an early interrogation session but i never dreamed that my captors would pressure him to falsely testify against me

19753,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, then he turned up his nose at khorramshahi and said we also request that you prohibit saberis lawyer from doing any more media interviews
19754,-0.0516,0.173,0.667,0.16,this is a securityrelated case and his interviews threaten our national security
19755,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, khorramshahi shot to his feet
19756,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the judge sided with baby face and ordered khorramshahi to abstain from interviews with all media except irans staterun news services
19757,0.7269,0.0,0.697,0.303,the judge laughed lightly and answered for baby face hes a representative from the intelligence ministry
19758,0.4215,0.0,0.931,0.069, then you must know my confession was false i said to the agent because when i told your colleague my bâzju that i had withdrawn it he said he had known from the very beginning it wasnt true
19759,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, if thats the case we can ask your bâzju the judge said with a smirk
19760,0.6618,0.058,0.709,0.232,there was no truth to this but i agreed to say it because they promised to release me if i cooperated
19761,-0.5423,0.241,0.759,0.0, by cooperate the judge said they meant confessing to your crime
19762,-0.5423,0.226,0.774,0.0, they meant confessing to a crime i did not commit i countered
19763,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we had never been given time to discuss my case
19764,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,on the way out of the courtroom i asked him if he could crossexamine the witness mr

19766,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the guard separated us before i could ask khorramshahi anything else
19767,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,on the way back to evin my stomach rumbled loudly but i didnt feel hungry
19768,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the trial was so short it seemed to have lasted only about half an hour
19769,-0.5777,0.13,0.825,0.046,although i hadnt expected much i never thought it would be so unjust and that i would have to present my own defense as my lawyer merely took notes
19770,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the judge must have made his ruling before the trial had even begun
19771,0.0,0.133,0.734,0.133,my blindfold which i tied on every night to block out our cells bright fluorescent light kept slipping

19776,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in the car on the short ride to the visitation building tasbihi instructed me to pass on a message to my mother and father
19777,-0.0972,0.131,0.747,0.122,the iranian authorities definitely seemed bothered by news coverage of my case and contrary to what tasbihi was now saying i had begun to believe this media attention was helping more than hurting me
19778,-0.0516,0.062,0.938,0.0,when my parents had remained quiet during the first month of my imprisonment the authorities had dragged their feet
19779,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,tasbihi ordered me to walk behind him when we entered the visitation building but i skipped ahead to my mother when i saw her waiting in the large hall
19780,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,tasbihi took us to the same private visitation room where we had met the week before
19781,0.659,0.0,0.834,0.166,it appeared my parents and i were getting special treatment perhaps because of all the media reports about my case or because we could be monitored more easily here
19782,-0.5423,0.134,0.866,0.0,after we sat down on the couch i told my parents how badly the trial had gone the previous day although i intentionally kept my descriptions vague in front of tasbihi
19783,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,khorramshahi told us about it
19784,-0.25,0.078,0.875,0.047, i said i wanted khorramshahi to show me the defense argument before he delivered it to the court so i too could have a say about what was written
19785,-0.5267,0.459,0.541,0.0,it could hurt my case
19786,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, our time was soon up and tasbihi told me i had to return to my cell
19787,-0.4939,0.186,0.745,0.069,if the sentence is  bad and it probably will be then talk to the media again
19788,-0.3252,0.08,0.92,0.0,  even though i had in a way passed on tasbihis message about the media my captors still were not satisfied as i learned the very next evening
19789,-0.5719,0.128,0.872,0.0,it was wednesday april 15weeks since i had last found myself sitting at the school desk in the dreadful interrogation room facing the wall blindfolded and unaware of how many men were behind me
19790,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i didnt know why i had been brought here and i wasnt about to let this turn into another interrogation
19791,0.2263,0.0,0.678,0.322,is your outdoor exercise adequate
19792,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i paused

19794,0.3818,0.0,0.455,0.545, and youre feeling well
19795,-0.5106,0.093,0.907,0.0, i was starting to wonder whether my voice was being recorded to be broadcast later to make it seem as if i was having the time of my life in evin prison
19796,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,excuse me i said but i thought my interrogation had finished
19797,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, yes it has tasbihi acknowledged
19798,-0.357,0.171,0.829,0.0,it is not to your benefit that your case has become so political
19799,0.3612,0.0,0.889,0.111, i heard him stand up click toward me and throw what sounded like a heap of papers on my desk
19800,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,look at these he ordered
19801,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i lifted my eyes and stared at the wall
19802,-0.6369,0.175,0.722,0.103,at last i had learned that engaging in conversation gave interrogators like him an opening to do what they were trained for to offend intimidate and lie to wear down an inmates mind and to provoke the prisoner with the aim of sparking an instinctively defensive and wordy outburst
19803,0.2023,0.0,0.816,0.184,ive highlighted the important parts for you in yellow
19804,-0.2263,0.073,0.927,0.0, he stopped at one article and began to read it aloud roxanas father said her lawyer met with her for the first time today
19805,-0.8376,0.427,0.573,0.0,the lawyer said she showed no signs of physical torture but initially appeared very depressed

19808,0.5106,0.0,0.645,0.355,will use any means to free you
19809,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but this display of news articles was building me up not breaking me down
19810,0.0516,0.085,0.799,0.116,i would like the same right i have seen granted to some other prisoners to call my parents once a week on a set day without having to ask you for permission every time
19811,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, javan paused
19812,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,do you know why
19813,-0.8402,0.5,0.5,0.0, because you think prisoners will kill themselves with it
19814,-0.7152,0.155,0.845,0.0, yes there was an incident some time ago well if someone really wanted to kill herself she could use the straps of her blindfold i pointed out
19815,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,then again these people had spoken so explicitly about sex in one of my interrogation sessions
19816,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what about a pen
19817,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i asked trying to change the subject
19818,0.5267,0.0,0.888,0.112,i wanted to mark important points in my books i told him without adding that i also needed it to take notes on my case in the margins where i hoped the guards wouldnt think to look
19819,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,tasbihi ordered me to lower my blindfold before i got up and walked toward the door to return to my cell
19820,-0.3818,0.206,0.794,0.0,roxana mahvash cried i cant believe you said that to him
19821,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i was back in my cell where i had recounted for my cellmates my latest runin with javan
19822,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,perhaps some of them were among those in the iranian diaspora spreading news about my detention that is if they werent too afraid their families would face repercussions back home
19823,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it was saturday april 18 and i had been brought back to the courthouse where khorramshahi and i were now sitting before the turbaned judge
19824,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the ruling was fairly long and i knew it would take me several minutes to read so i asked my lawyer to summarize it
19825,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i was trying to find a numberone two however many years i was supposed to remain in jail
19826,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,maybe i hadnt heard my lawyer correctly
19827,0.2382,0.09,0.775,0.136,after a farce of a trial what else should i have expected but a joke of a ruling
19828,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,why
19829,0.52,0.0,0.813,0.187, with nothing to lose now i figured i might as well tell him though i hardly knew where to begin
19830,0.25,0.0,0.923,0.077,because you didnt give me a chance to discuss my case with my attorney and he saw my file only one day before the trial
19831,0.0516,0.13,0.734,0.136,i didnt even realize the trial had begun until several minutes after it started you didnt grant us the delay you promised and my coerced false confession was used against me
19832,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, by the time i finished speaking the judges face had grown contorted
19833,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,dont sign it i ordered
19834,0.25,0.0,0.867,0.133,his pen was poised above the blank space at the end of page two
19835,0.128,0.0,0.927,0.073,before leaving the courtroom khorramshahi showed me a copy of the brief defense he had turned in after my trial
19836,-0.7184,0.179,0.821,0.0,the prison guard was telling me i had to leave so khorramshahi quickly explained that he had argued i didnt have any classified materials my confession was false and i was simply writing a book
19837,-0.1511,0.614,0.386,0.0,not important
19838,-0.0516,0.146,0.854,0.0, the guard gestured at me to leave
19839,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,hes waiting outside the building

19841,0.128,0.0,0.93,0.07,  as i was led out of the courthouse i scanned the parking lot with blazing eyes yearning to find bahman
19842,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,get in the car my guard ordered me
19843,0.34,0.0,0.854,0.146,his image played over and over in my mind on the way back to evin
19844,-0.2732,0.162,0.713,0.125,he had put himself in a great deal of danger by showing up before at evin and now at court and seeing him for the first time after all these weeks stirred emotions that i had been trying to repress to better cope with prison
19845,0.5267,0.0,0.794,0.206,i couldnt imagine how he my family and my friends would handle the news of my conviction and sentence
19846,0.34,0.0,0.916,0.084,i also believed my eightyear sentence could create an even bigger international uproar than if i had been given only one or two years and it had erased any inkling in my mind that i might be treated fairly
19847,0.1531,0.0,0.904,0.096,judge moqiseh had given my lawyer twenty days to submit a request to appeal the verdict
19848,0.8854,0.0,0.618,0.382,in the meantime i would expand my defense team a wish that khorramshahi had this time respected without threatening to take himself off the case
19849,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had told him before leaving the courthouse that i wanted to work with shirin ebadi and her colleague abdolfattah soltani who were representing the bahais
19850,0.1531,0.144,0.727,0.129,both attorneys had spent time behind bars for their work but once freed they had continued to take on tough politically charged cases
19851,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had heard this lawyers name before but knew nothing about him so i told khorramshahi to focus on retaining soltani
19852,0.34,0.0,0.833,0.167,the appellate court certainly wouldnt reduce my eight years to nothing i predicted
19853,0.7469,0.066,0.704,0.23,at best the court would give me a couple of years in prison and then i would have to appeal again but to the supreme court
19854,-0.6908,0.271,0.729,0.0,it was the only weapon available to me to pressure the iranian authorities in the next critical stage of my case
19855,-0.2498,0.105,0.895,0.0,but if i began right away the authorities might not allow me to see my parents or soltani
19856,0.6124,0.0,0.85,0.15,today was the western medias turn to speak out against the eightyear sentence of roxana saberi who was convicted of spying for the united states i was surprised to hear the tv anchor say on sunday night
19857,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this was the first time i was hearing news about my case on irib
19858,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he had taken me into an interrogation room and asked whether i had watched the news the night before

20199,-0.1406,0.089,0.851,0.06,as author and historian ervand abrahamian explained to me interrogators often give prisoners a list of topics they should mention but let them write their own confession in an attempt to make the wording fit the victim sound believable and therefore serve as a tool for swaying public opinion
20200,-0.2023,0.107,0.812,0.081,as a result of these tactics captors such as mine like to claim they never force anyone to make a false confession and that prisoners confess voluntarily

20215,-0.8934,0.287,0.713,0.0,as author abrahamian says many see such confessions as a sign of being human rather than as a sign of weakness and they are likely to ridicule the interrogator while pitying the prisoner

20218,-0.836,0.207,0.793,0.0,one reason interrogators collect even seemingly insignificant information is to scare future prisoners into talking by making them think their captors know more than they actually do a method i later realized my interrogators used with me

20222,-0.6705,0.244,0.756,0.0, i have also learned that some prisoners have been falsely accused as i was of having classified documents
20223,-0.1027,0.062,0.887,0.051,shortly after my release i was surprised to hear that my attorneys had begun to announce to the media that i had copied a classified document contradicting what they themselves had said at my trial
20224,-0.4404,0.153,0.847,0.0,perhaps they were intimidated by the iranian authorities or colluded with them to try to discredit me

20228,-0.0516,0.13,0.87,0.0,as ebadi told me it was all a trick
20229,0.3818,0.111,0.732,0.157, maybe in the end the iranian authorities promoted this falsehood as my main crime because amid the international outcry they were hoping to save face by presenting a pretext for my imprisonment other than a confession whose validity i had denied while still in custody
20230,-0.34,0.167,0.833,0.0,many people have asked me if i understand the reasons behind my arrest
20231,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,so my captors must have had other motives for my incarceration such as possible political reasons wanting to justify their investment in monitoring me and making demands such as having me spy for them
20232,0.419,0.065,0.801,0.135,they also seemed extremely bothered by the fact that i could move freely around iran to interview people in their own language and without a government minder for a book the authorities could not censor
20233,0.5106,0.0,0.82,0.18,the decision to free me i have heard was likely made even before my appellate trial

20248,0.9022,0.09,0.682,0.228,however they face fierce opposition from extremists who seem blinded by their own pursuit of power and their failure to recognize that the key to longterm security lies not in control and intimidation but in tolerance an exchange of ideas and winning the hearts and minds of disaffected groups and independent thinkers

20383,-0.7645,0.097,0.903,0.0,my arrest in 1977 took place at the end of the most severe phase of political suppression by mohammad reza shah pahlavis regime which followed the first armed struggle of a leftist guerrilla group sazmane cherikhaye fadayeee khalghe iran iranian peoples selfsacrificing guerrilla organization in 1970 and was intensified between 1974 and 1976 when the leftistleaning islamic organization sazmane âmojahedine khalghe iran iranian peoples warriors organization also joined in militant activities against the regime
20384,-0.9097,0.312,0.654,0.034,during this period arrests and executions reached a new pinnacle and incredibly horrific means of torture were utilized to force the detainees to confess even to the most trivial accusations or crimes

20387,-0.8908,0.298,0.702,0.0,my arrest coincided with the end of this period of extreme brutality and the beginning of a new phase when physical torture was less commonly employed during interrogations
20388,-0.806,0.371,0.629,0.0,obviously this did not prevent the regime from subjecting prisoners to this socalled white or soft torture
20389,-0.8277,0.19,0.772,0.037,it did not stop the regime for example from forcing prisoners to stand on their feet for days and nights violently waking them up every time they seemed to have fallen sleep or when moving one leg up to give it a rest

20400,-0.2023,0.115,0.794,0.091, rather than a discussion of ethics these debates basically revolved around such questions as whether or not these measures could be considered torture and if they were effective
20401,0.1027,0.075,0.818,0.107,politicians concerned with such techniques mainly asked for example whether or not performing waterboarding on a detainee more than eighty times produced the kind of result that was worth damaging the image of the united states in the world
20402,-0.7906,0.171,0.829,0.0,those who discussed and wrote about these techniques in so much detail did so perhaps without having ever been haunted by the frozen stare of a woman or a man subjected to these methods of torture
20403,-0.5994,0.159,0.781,0.06,by the time of my arrest in early 1977 when i met the woman whose name i never learned the oldstyle hardcore torture was giving way to  prologue  7  the white nonphysical interrogation techniques
20404,-0.3769,0.335,0.487,0.178,the regime could now claim that prisoners were no longer tortured
20405,-0.2572,0.184,0.709,0.107,as long as ones legs were torn apart not by the heavy strikes of cables on the soles of the feet but rather by forced standing on them no torture had occurred
20406,0.34,0.0,0.947,0.053,in todays world in which machines technologies and devices seem to be doing all the work where hands have nearly become the extensions of technology rather than the other way around any production without devices and machines may easily be construed as nonwork nonproduction
20407,-0.631,0.293,0.707,0.0,but when i was arrested i knew nothing of these changes
20408,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the atmosphere in the society out of which i was taken to jail felt heavier than ever
20409,-0.9337,0.206,0.794,0.0,my knowledge of prison and torture amounted to no more than a few banned books and pamphlets i had read some horrific stories i had heard on the underground radio broadcasts from outside iran and plenty of rumors circulating within iran which were substantiated during family gatherings by whispers about distant young male relatives who had emerged from jail but remained mute and lost with deformed feet and their toenails having fallen off
20410,-0.4404,0.188,0.691,0.121,no wonder therefore that when i found myself in the komitehye moshtarake zedde kharabkari united antisabotage committee a notorious detention center built under the shahs regime on the site of the former central prison my then young heart vacillated between pausing for breath and pounding heavily
20411,0.1027,0.05,0.892,0.058,i still vividly remember that as i read the carved writings of legendary dissidents on the walls of the cell into which i was thrown after my interrogation i simultaneously felt proud burdened by the responsibility of living up to the level of their resistance and somewhat out of place
20412,-0.9676,0.365,0.567,0.068,but the timing of my arrest would save me from witnessing or being subjected to some of the most horrific devices of torture that had severely scarred many women arrested earlier whom i would meet in jail in the next two years
20413,-0.9042,0.287,0.668,0.045,for since early 1978 having agreed that political prisons could be inspected by the red cross the shahs regime could no longer use its old torture devices to inflict overt torture or enduring pain on detainees
20414,-0.5994,0.109,0.891,0.0,8  prologue  it did not take long for this place to once again fully function as a torture chamber now by the islamic republic and under a new title komitehye touhid unity committee
20415,-0.9511,0.269,0.731,0.0,if under the shah the function of this torture chamber was to use the regimes penal system against its political dissidents whom they tortured or eliminated under the guise of fighting kharabkari sabotage under the islamic republic the interrogators crushed their opponents under the pretext of extracting satan from their souls
20416,-0.8591,0.345,0.586,0.068,through torture or killing they brought the lost souls of dissidents into unity with god or so the name unity committee implied
20417,-0.8126,0.177,0.823,0.0,a haunting detour i did not experience interrogation under the unity committee for my arrest in early 1983 was not made by the revolutionary guards of the islamic republic who ran the infamous unity committee and oversaw all its interrogations and torture
20418,-0.7351,0.267,0.733,0.0,rather i was hunted down by the revolutionary public persecution of tehran which ruled over the notorious evin prison
20419,-0.6808,0.152,0.806,0.043,in 1983 on the way to evin i was driven through the piche toubeh repentance curve the name the agents who arrested me used to refer to the last curve of the road before reaching the prison
20420,-0.8316,0.358,0.642,0.0,in evin also as piche toubeh suggested prisoners were to either be killed or become repentant
20421,-0.8316,0.315,0.685,0.0,i visited this site of death and torture which until recently had been in use by this very regime
20422,-0.6249,0.21,0.712,0.078,from the ominous clouds that were rapidly gathering over the iranian political scene one could easily anticipate the rising of new waves of state violence
20423,-0.7506,0.18,0.781,0.039,with an eerie feeling i thus read my name on the wall of this once horrific dungeon along with the names of many others who had inhabited this place under the shahs regime
20424,-0.836,0.298,0.702,0.0,hesitantly i signed my name fearful that the guard might check the records and realize that i had been a prisoner of both regimes
20425,0.2732,0.0,0.916,0.084,in this place only a few years earlier the interrogators of this very government had ushered many of their opponents into unity with god
20426,-0.8074,0.327,0.673,0.0, these detainees were either eradicated or were forced to live a bare life as walking dead
20427,-0.9537,0.268,0.688,0.044,it was partially a result of this brutal suppression of dissidents in the first ten years following the revolution that in the early 2000s the islamic republic felt confident enough to make a spectacle of the shahs torture chamber while remaining entirely silent about the death suffering and destruction that occurred there by its own hands
20428,-0.8573,0.247,0.703,0.049,in this journey through the labyrinth of the museum of information i was accompanied by a woman friend ferdous who was also a former political prisoner but interrogated and tortured in the unity committee
20429,-0.836,0.207,0.748,0.046,the bitter taste in my mouth from witnessing the nearly absolute erasure of the history of the leftists resistance and suffering under the united antisabotage committee and an exaggerated predominance of religious clergy presented in this museum became unbearable when ferdous recalled the different spots where she had been interrogated and beaten
20430,-0.9196,0.343,0.552,0.105,they ran around laughed loudly and screamed almost hysterically and playfully as we shivered to our bones at the horrific sight of the humansize statues that too closely represented victims of torture and their torturers
20431,0.204,0.09,0.805,0.104,the boys mockery reminded me of a more bitter parody that of a dream that was once expressed by some of us during those elated moments of the victory  10  prologue  of the revolution of 1979 of the possibility of a day when all the shahs prisons would be turned into museums
20432,-0.2023,0.098,0.8,0.102,now here we were walking around this prisonmuseum whose opening to the public felt like a slap in the face considering that both ferdous and i had lived through the torture chambers of this regime
20433,-0.8591,0.216,0.784,0.0,i was dumbfounded by the cynical depiction in this prisonmuseum not merely in its blunt silencing of some experiences while highlighting others but also by the way it continued to exercise violence in other prisons when turning this one into a museum
20434,0.1027,0.04,0.914,0.047,through transforming this jail into a museum while maintaining and even expanding others the regime at once ignored and reenacted the beheading of all those dreams of a brief moment in the spring of freedom following the 1979 revolution when the idea of closing prisons and opening them to the public as museums was envisioned
20435,0.3818,0.084,0.779,0.136,soon however i would realize that compared to what was to come after 2004 this period though itself cynical was relatively speaking a semispring of freedom
20436,-0.0258,0.196,0.612,0.193,all i could hear was the howling of my many tortured friends amid the cacophony of laughter and threats of interrogators of both regimes
20437,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i whispered lets go
20438,-0.7184,0.143,0.857,0.0, we almost ran out of this hellish place where each of us had been an inhabiâ tant i under the shahs regime and she under the islamic republic of iran
20439,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,as we left the museum of information i thought of the double connotation of the term ettelaat which means both information obtained upheld and revealed by the secret police and information as knowledge whose purpose is to raise consciousness

20441,-0.6249,0.157,0.843,0.0,i thought of the contaminating power of violence and money of the way they both often spoil whoever or whatever comes their way
20442,-0.1779,0.088,0.817,0.095,i hence write today for the sake of all those friendswhom i either knew personally or my soul knew of their spirit of resistance and desire for justicewhose refusal to submit to the power of money and violence cost their lives

20444,-0.2617,0.045,0.955,0.0,1  in the footsteps of the giants  when i was arrested in 1977 i knew very little of the changes on the horizon that were soon to transform not only the iranian sociopolitical landscape but its penal system and hence my own experiences of imprisonment

20446,-0.6597,0.098,0.902,0.0,yet from my first day of school in âtehran in my tenthgrade year when shockingly i heard my classmates making a mockery of the national anthem by twisting its words may our king live forever to the donkey has tail and hoof to that late evening of my arrest by three savak agents the world had drastically changed around and in me
20447,-0.8211,0.207,0.703,0.089,here i was now in the united antisabotage committee perhaps the most notorious detention center for political prisoners in iran at the time faced with the interrogators whose names i had heard on the underâground radio who had acquired their fame through demonstrations of the utmost brutality against many legendary dissidents
20448,-0.8481,0.26,0.691,0.048,even with my insufficient knowledge of the savak and its jails i was well aware of the fact that one did not need to be a serious threat to the regime to be severely tortured
20449,-0.7845,0.315,0.685,0.0,my pursuit of banned books and dissident views was enough to subject me to torture and imprisonment
20450,-0.0516,0.068,0.87,0.062,nonetheless the fact that i had no connection to the guerrilla movement would have to be a factor in easing my interrogation process at least in that particular historical moment
20451,-0.1531,0.149,0.709,0.142,as his voyeuristic gaze violently examined my entire body nearly undressing me with his lustful eyesin my mind even with his widely grinning teethand as he moved from advising this young pretty and smart girl to save herself from the torment of torture to slapping hitting with his fists and kicking i awaited and imagined myself under the real torture with which he was threatening me
20452,-0.9507,0.269,0.691,0.04,the metaphorical marriage of sex and violence found a real face when hosseini the most infamous torturer in the united antisabotage committee sat quietly as an emblem of sheer animalistic violence while others put on a show of competition of the most penetrating gaze on my body and the dirtiest assaults on my character
20453,0.9001,0.0,0.824,0.176,i clenched inside as they apparently enjoyed this visual feast with remarks like she looks as sweet as her first name alluding to the name shirin which means sweet which the friend who had reported me to savak used to call me or she is as edible as her last name referring to my last name talebi which means melon
20454,-0.4404,0.132,0.868,0.0, rasouli kept repeating the words talebie shirin or sweet melon while blinking with a dirty look in his eyes
20455,-0.5994,0.206,0.794,0.0,i however tried to concentrate on what i assumed to be awaiting me the real torture
20456,-0.7579,0.333,0.667,0.0,would i be able to withstand the severe torture that i conjured to be imminent

20458,-0.6882,0.272,0.534,0.194,that my devotion to justice should help me to stay firm for no matter how excruciating my pain it could never be as everlasting as that of the dispossessed people who live with constant humiliation and die gradually i assured myself

20460,-0.9686,0.525,0.432,0.042,as fearful as i was of the menace of torture with which they were threatening me i felt even more terrified of feeling so belittled
20461,-0.1779,0.111,0.798,0.091,i therefore kept telling myself that if put under real torture i had to show them that i was more than a little pretty girl as they kept calling me
20462,-0.5994,0.231,0.769,0.0,i was nevertheless sent to solitary confinement without being subjected to that real torture
20463,-0.7615,0.267,0.652,0.081,for the next four days i waited restlessly for a call to interrogation and torture nearly disappointed that i was not and horrified that i would be
20464,0.7506,0.041,0.811,0.147,i read and touched the writings on the walls of my cell one of them written by the poet whose poetry i loved as if hoping that through my touch their magical power would penetrate my body and soul and i would become immune to the desires and weaknesses of my own flesh
20465,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,but only a few days later the guards took me to the upper floor and put me in a room with five other inmates
20466,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it was here that i began to see the rapid changes in that jail
20467,-0.5106,0.136,0.864,0.0,they painted the rooms cleaned the hallways fixed the toilets and bathrooms gave us spoons for eating and treated prisoners less harshly
20468,0.3919,0.0,0.908,0.092,but once again neither i nor the others in jail knew yet of the transforming power dynamics that were forcing the regime to change its penal policies
20469,-0.4939,0.11,0.836,0.054,thus when only six days after my arrest azodi one of the highestranking savak officials came into the room and i remained sitting while other inmates stood up as an indication of their respect for him as was the unwritten rule i expected to be sent directly to the torture room
20470,-0.8271,0.195,0.805,0.0,i recalled the story i had heard on the underground radio a couple of years earlier of a man who had refused to stand up during one of azodis visits to his cell and was subjected to severe torture
20471,-0.743,0.202,0.747,0.051,even when on the day of my trial i resisted the governmentassigned lawyers advice to beg forgiveness from the shah and the judge i believed his threat about the possibility of being sentenced to death
20472,-0.8053,0.22,0.663,0.117,but i received a twoyear sentence which made me feel somewhat embarrassed for i knew that the stance i took in the court could have easily resulted in a much harsher sentence had i been arrested a few months earlier
20473,-0.5994,0.217,0.665,0.118,little did i know that even before my twoyear sentence was completed i would be among those prisoners the shah was forced to free under the pressure of the revolutionary movement
20474,-0.3818,0.109,0.833,0.058,some politicians among his western allies began to see his new policies as a threat to the balance of power in the region and to their own dominance
20475,0.0516,0.137,0.721,0.142,thus when jimmy carter became president of the united states he  in the footsteps of the giants  17  put pressure on the shah to alleviate political suppression reduce censorship and improve prison conditions
20476,-0.1027,0.134,0.753,0.113,these changes reconfigured the landscape of iranian society as well as its detention centers and prisons
20477,-0.25,0.168,0.714,0.117,initially the regime pressed prisoners to sign letters of pardon to the shah requesting their release
20478,0.4549,0.0,0.729,0.271,those who did so were freed in november 1977
20479,-0.4767,0.344,0.51,0.146,many others refused to ask for a pardon and remained jailed
20480,0.3291,0.13,0.701,0.169,but by november 1978 people had turned into roaring rivers demonstrating on the street and chanting for the freedom of political prisoners and making other demands
20481,-0.34,0.156,0.708,0.137,these increasingly growing mass demonstrations compelled the shah to order the unconditional release of the majority of prisoners
20482,-0.4588,0.16,0.777,0.063,about four months before my sentence was over my name appeared along with 999 other prisoners for release
20483,-0.34,0.082,0.918,0.0,even though the period of my stay in jail was less than two years the outside world had radically changed between the time of my arrest and release
20484,0.3612,0.143,0.563,0.294,the government hoped that by freeing these prisoners it could prevent the movement from becoming more radicalized
20485,-0.8456,0.292,0.708,0.0,people who awaited us in front of the jails were moving to the next stage demanding not only the freedom of all political prisoners but also the collapse of the entire regime
20486,-0.3612,0.082,0.918,0.0,the lonely shoulders unlike my release in 1978 my departure from jail in 1991 under the islamâ ic republic was not instigated by the power of a revolutionary movement
20487,-0.6249,0.212,0.734,0.054,there were no people waiting outside the jail this time to carry prisoners on their shoulders or take them to the demonstration
20488,-0.3818,0.121,0.815,0.064,in 1978 i had to change my prison uniform to the only other piece of clothing i had a wornout tunic to avoid being raised on peoples shoulders for i did not see my trivial imprisonment worthy of such attention
20489,-0.128,0.112,0.78,0.107,although my release in late 1991 was also an attempt by the regime to resolve the problem of political prisoners the plan to free prisoners in the 1990s was dependent on accepting the regimes condition of release which required signing a printed form known as enzejar nameh a letter of repugnance or ârepudiation or at  18  in the footsteps of the giants  least a mild version of it which indicated the person denounced all dissident organizations and promised to avoid having any relationship with any kind of dissidence
20490,0.2769,0.055,0.861,0.084,those of us who did not accept this condition were set free only on a temporary basis even though we were not asked to return to jail when the period of our temporary release was up
20491,0.0772,0.0,0.902,0.098,our sentence was however pending in case the government decided to enforce it
20492,-0.3425,0.084,0.868,0.048,the fact that the release of prisoners in the1990s was not initiated by a revolutionary movement did not mean that there was no pressure both within and outside iran to urge the government toward this decision
20493,0.3612,0.089,0.755,0.156,rather it implied that as in 1977 in the early 1990s the state was confident enough to negotiate its power over prisoners and press them to accept the condition of release
20494,-0.607,0.276,0.724,0.0,those who remained fierce in refusing to submit were not freed at least not officially
20495,0.4215,0.081,0.777,0.142,yet my release in 1978 which seemed such a radical freedom was abruptly ended by my arrest and return to jail under the new regime
20496,-0.4019,0.162,0.838,0.0,this time however i would be married to hamid whom i would lose to execution
20497,0.8441,0.037,0.822,0.141,ironically the temporary nature of this freedom would allow me and others in similar circumstances to leave the country more easily for since we had not been legally released our names were not in the computer system as people who were prohibited from traveling abroad at least so the interrogators told my father after my departure from iran in late 1993
20498,-0.6652,0.122,0.878,0.0,but those prisoners who had given in to the condition of release and had signed papers had to report to the regime on a regular first weekly then biweekly and finally monthly basis
20499,-0.3296,0.158,0.711,0.131,they were not allowed to leave the country strangely therefore those of us who had not been officially released were able to leave the country legally while many of those who had been legally freed had to take the risk of being smuggled out
20500,0.6808,0.08,0.75,0.171,yet our unofficial release remained precarious for we could easily be forced to serve the remainder of our sentence if we were ever arrested again this does not mean that others could not be rearrested but that our freedom felt even more fragile
20501,-0.0941,0.169,0.671,0.16,his fear of the possibility of my rearrest and imprisonment was so grave for him that he preferred for us to live apart so i could be free and safe
20502,-0.2484,0.092,0.861,0.047,my freedom felt so shaky that when i was deciding to visit iran in 2002 for the first time since having left in late 1993 i not only had to deal with my friends opposition to the ideain fact one of my dissertation advisers believed that i was returning to iran because of my urge for a heroic actbut to hide it from my parents until i knew i was able to leave the airport rather than be arrested on the spot
20503,-0.2732,0.137,0.763,0.101,to protect my parents from worrying about the possibility of my arrest and the heartache in case i was arrested i had told only one of my sisters about the date of my arrival and asked her not to tell anyone until i had safely exited the airport gate
20504,0.5859,0.068,0.728,0.204,the temporary basis of this release also made it hard to feel a real sense of freedom
20505,-0.7003,0.172,0.828,0.0,i dreamed of torture when i felt pressured even by the deadlines i set for myself while writing my doctoral dissertation which led to my unconscious resistance to meeting them

20529,-0.5423,0.194,0.675,0.131,this refusal was meant to at once emphasize our demand for the release of all inmates and deny the regime a chance to send us out in the darkness of nightits tactic to prevent families from another gathering since every gathering was a chance for people to cry out their demand for the freedom of all political prisoners

20551,-0.8074,0.266,0.652,0.083,the regimes confidence hinged upon the assumption that by killing so many dissidents and pushing the remainder of them into a state of despair through torture the movement was beheaded
20552,-0.4939,0.191,0.688,0.122,the flip side of this âconfidence was the pressure and an urgent need to create a new socioâpolitical environment in the aftermath of the iraniraq war

20554,-0.9044,0.307,0.645,0.048,releasing prisoners was one of the most important steps that the regime had to take albeit in an excruciatingly complex and violent process that was to avoid the fate of the shahs regime
20555,-0.6059,0.169,0.738,0.093,the release of prisoners thus became the goal that the state pursued at nearly all costs except that it was to appear not as an act of a defeated regime like that of the shah but as a gesture of strength and stability by a state that no longer felt threatened by its opponents
20556,0.4404,0.0,0.873,0.127,in fact the regime preferred the more colorful story in which its prisons had turned all its opponents to its supporters
20557,-0.5106,0.066,0.934,0.0,as the shah did in 1977 the islamic republic regime began by forcing prisoners to submit to the condition of their release which required their renunciation of their past and any political and ideological inclinations and affiliations that diverged from those of the official discourse of the state

20636,0.0772,0.0,0.961,0.039,the landscape of this humanmaking factory was a large hall in vahede 1 ward or unit 1 within which a large number of small cells were temporarily built by erecting makeshift wooden walls

20638,-0.765,0.132,0.846,0.022,the wooden walls were high enough to prevent prisoners from seeing each other while they were either sitting or lying down which was their status all the time except for brief moments when they would be taken to the restroom for a shower or for interrogation
20639,-0.5106,0.084,0.916,0.0,all prisoners faced the wall again depending on the location of their spot they faced either the wall of the hall if their cell was adjacent to any four walls of the hall or the wooden wall

20643,-0.4364,0.129,0.786,0.085,since the prisoners were blindfolded all the time these blows which so abruptly struck their bodies almost always unexpectedly carved a huge hole in their minds within which the deadly bird of anticipation hovered constantly flapping its wings
20644,-0.5106,0.155,0.845,0.0,from six in the morning until ten at night prisoners had to squat on the floor motionless and silent
20645,-0.7906,0.203,0.706,0.091,even the softest of the lashes by these former friends who were now playing extra hands of evil felt harsher on prisoners bodies these lashes sank deeper into their memories and burned an irreducible enduring register of pain in their minds and bodies
20646,0.0516,0.278,0.435,0.287,trust was shattered it survived in an abstract language which was already eluding prisoners
20647,-0.5106,0.08,0.92,0.0,those who had gone through this calamitous situation be it the collaborators or the resistant prisoners were marked by its injuries which they carried with them to the wards where they were returned and perhaps later everywhere they went
20648,-0.8316,0.302,0.698,0.0,the question remained however what kind of survival was this since death had captured them before they could physically die
20649,-0.8442,0.252,0.748,0.0,they sent them under torture by false statements they hated any sign of resistance for they saw it as the negation of their presently precarious existence
20650,-0.9313,0.275,0.664,0.061,but if these prisoners were still capable of functioning albeit in a deadly and destructive manner there were others who appeared so oblivious to their existence that even death could pass them by without noticing them or being noticed by them
20651,-0.6908,0.191,0.743,0.066,although the corpse of a stagnant life was still  42  in the footsteps of the giants  clinging to its vegetative being like a parasite the prisoner had already departed this world
20652,-0.9451,0.388,0.612,0.0,they became the subject of a neverceasing torture humiliation and pain eternally reproduced in their own mind a mind possessed by and frozen in a horrifyingly everpresent past
20653,-0.6597,0.109,0.891,0.0,this was a state of being in which the self was frozen either at the time before the horrific experience or at the moment of its occurrence as if nothing existed before or from that moment on
20654,-0.5006,0.196,0.662,0.142,but a small number of prisoners came out of this humanmaking factory with their subjectivity still somewhat intact

20656,-0.611,0.148,0.852,0.0,she returned to the ward but soon withdrew from others and remained in a kind of isolation that resembled her condition in the dastgah
20657,0.481,0.114,0.703,0.183,it is true that some of them explained this desire for isolation as a way of distancing themselves from other inmates who they argued were unable to recognize the consequences of their adventurous actions against the regime
20658,-0.4767,0.094,0.906,0.0,they recounted how some of the most outspoken inmates were broken in the dastgah even faster than others and how they turned into collaborators who reported menacingly on their former cellmates
20659,-0.6537,0.368,0.513,0.119,many prisoners perceived these withdrawn inmates as cynical as political pessimists if not just broken
20660,-0.6486,0.257,0.664,0.079,those who had chosen to withdraw from others in turn construed other prisoners as politically naïve or irresponsible adventurers
20661,-0.5106,0.113,0.887,0.0,some of these prisoners would realize that they had superimposed their own experiences and emotions onto the views of their political affiliations only after they were released
20662,-0.4497,0.134,0.866,0.0,but while in jail as time went by the distance between those who were isolated and the others grew deeper

20667,0.3612,0.069,0.79,0.141,her words made me realize how strong the bond of pain was between those of us who had experienced those years of imprisonment and the challenges of surviving in the world so estranged  44  in the footsteps of the giants  from it
20668,-0.5106,0.093,0.907,0.0,the we of which she was speaking was a reference to all of us former political prisoners with whom she now seemed to feel a deeper connection than to her own family members
20669,0.803,0.0,0.801,0.199,this was a kinship felt not only by pori but by nearly all of us who had survived imprisonment without becoming collaborators or without having completely lost ourselves in the process
20670,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in regard to haji davouds humanmaking machine both the experiences of those inmates who lived through it and the language with which they spoke of it varied from one person to another
20671,-0.743,0.223,0.777,0.0,male prisoners seemed to have chosen a single metaphor taboota to refer to the place within which they were forced to live for months
20672,-0.5106,0.105,0.895,0.0,notwithstanding its initial coinage it appeared to have resonated with nearly all prisoners for after hearingâit from men women often spoke of those cells either as ghabra or taboota
20673,-0.296,0.099,0.901,0.0,perhaps no other name could have conveyed as accurately what the place was to achieve the annihilation of prisoners old selves
20674,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,some women simply spoke of it as âvahedeâ1 which alluded to the ward within which the wooden cells were erected
20675,-0.8689,0.197,0.803,0.0,others referred to it as gharantineh or quarantine also the name haji davoud and other prison officials used for the large hall in this ward  in the footsteps of the giants  45  where prisoners were often taken for different periods for further punishment
20676,-0.8225,0.197,0.803,0.0,as the name suggests the place was to temporarily segregateâthe contagiously dangerous elements from the rest of the prisoners as is theâpurpose of quarantine in epidemics until they were either cured or dead
20677,-0.8773,0.177,0.823,0.0,for instance was the term taboota which nowadays has been adopted more broadly by most former prisoners and even the larger public to allude to the presumably unisex experience of prisoners in those punishment wards simply coined by men based on the physical resemblance between those wooden cells and coffins
20678,-0.8834,0.209,0.791,0.0,yet this argument rests on two assumptions on a stereotypical view of men as more practical minded than women and a reductive notion of death that does not take the complexities of prisoners experiences and views of life and death into account
20679,-0.8201,0.235,0.692,0.073,but in a sense haji davouds humanmaking machine a term known by both male and female prisoners was intended to produce his desirable humans through the destruction of prisoners old selves
20680,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,even though haji could not break everyone and  46  in the footsteps of the giants  the ward was finally closed down those who emerged were not the same as the ones who had gone in
20681,-0.34,0.137,0.775,0.088,for example ascribing names like coffins or graves could implicitly articulate and reinforce prisoners sense of death as an inevitable destinyation of hajis project
20682,-0.5994,0.281,0.719,0.0,death however does not mean only a physical ceasing of existence
20683,-0.5994,0.281,0.719,0.0,death appeared differently in the language of men and women inmates
20684,-0.743,0.412,0.588,0.0,male prisoners used the word zadan beating to refer to execution
20685,-0.4588,0.3,0.7,0.0,why should execution be considered synonymous with beating
20686,-0.4215,0.208,0.636,0.156,isnt it true that under torture inmates had to give up the body on which the torturer exercised his power in order to preserve their integrity
20687,0.4939,0.0,0.868,0.132,isnt it the case that to save their soul inmates had to detach themselves from their body and let the body go
20688,-0.5994,0.157,0.843,0.0,which one of these meanings of life and death did these men have in mind when they used zadan to mean execution
20689,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,how should one interpret the fact that women distinguish between zadan and eedām execution
20690,-0.5994,0.196,0.804,0.0,are these differences merely gendered languages or did the experiences of torture differ for men and women
20691,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,although women do not use one name for the ward and the cells in it almost every name has something to do with the official reference
20692,-0.5423,0.062,0.938,0.0,for example vahede 1 simply refers to the ward in which these wooden cells  in the footsteps of the giants  47  were set up dastgah was hajis word only shortened and takhta alluded to a small space nearly the size of a small single bed between the wooden walls where the prisoner could sleep
20693,-0.296,0.087,0.913,0.0,to refuse to name this place with a single term may indicate women inmates refusal to submit to a single possible outcome or destiny
20694,-0.8555,0.272,0.674,0.054,the names could also be considered evidence of womens naïveté as their failure to understand the significance of this torture machine and the limitations of human capacity for tolerating pain
20695,-0.4019,0.124,0.876,0.0,it was not rare to hear of the inadequacy of female inmates knowledge and experience of political activism and imprisonment
20696,0.0772,0.0,0.944,0.056,of course the number of men who had experienced imprisonment under both the shah and the islamic republic far exceeded that of women
20697,-0.3182,0.087,0.913,0.0,however assuming for instance that womens shortening hajis term humanmaking machine to machine was an unimaginative act of mere abbreviation sounds rather odd to me
20698,-0.4798,0.278,0.543,0.179,words were not casually utilized in prison particularly under the islamic republic words could easily save someone or lead to someones death
20699,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this raises another question to what extent does language speak us or we speak language
20700,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i also keep contemplating the manner in which such otherly worlds and words find their way to my present world the way they get translated to a corresponding language in daily life outside jail
20701,-0.296,0.049,0.951,0.0,this noise took me back to seven years earlier when the bus in which i met pori came to a stop with such a sound reminding me of the lash that stroked the air and fell on inmates bodies to rip their flesh off
20702,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i never saw her again but i looked with those eyes when in europe i saw zinat my former cellmate
20703,0.8074,0.053,0.709,0.238,i lived that alienation when in the early years of coming to the united states i went to parties where the conversation often revolved around beautiful dresses goodlooking babes and fancy cars
20704,-0.9349,0.452,0.548,0.0,but i felt that the real torture had not yet started and i was impatiently and fearfully anticipating it
20705,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the whole day i thought what was it that helped me survive that impossible situation
20706,-0.5574,0.153,0.847,0.0,contemplating the state of my being only then did i realize the selves that had died within me without my recognition

21079,0.5719,0.02,0.893,0.087,later i would be taken to the same ward as soosan and i would realize that the game rahim played that day about her choice between execution and freedom by merely accepting or denying all dissident organizations and ideas was not a mere show that in fact she was to have been executed but was given twelve years time only because the circumstances changed from 1983 and the execution sentences were less summarily given at least until the massacre of 1988

22621,0.8591,0.0,0.765,0.235,use of this term is also a sign of respect and as such i prefer not to apply it to khomeini a man who became responsible for the deaths of a great many iranians
22622,-0.7184,0.145,0.79,0.065,while my family were still ambivalent about the shahs departure and the revolution as a whole i do remember a nagging sense of comfort that perhaps this would also be the end of savak and the constant unspoken fear that to do or say something against the government would lead to imprisonment or worse
22623,0.6369,0.085,0.714,0.201,as a student in the 1940s he had become a champion of the poor and an advocate for a traditional form of islam with an emphasis on social justice

22629,0.7951,0.067,0.669,0.264,there was an enormous sense of excitement at these meetings  simply the freedom to hold a meeting without the risk of arrest was something new to us
22630,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the removal of the shah from power had brought an end to hundreds of years of rule by monarchy and an end to autocracy if only briefly

22645,-0.5809,0.126,0.874,0.0,the widespread lack of political awareness meant that few people thought to question this most people had no idea that khomeinis islamic state would turn out to be very different to anything they had imagined

22653,0.25,0.058,0.841,0.102,khomeini had come to power on a lie a promise to remove the suppression that had been imposed by the shah
22654,-0.4509,0.208,0.669,0.122,instead of providing freedom he had done the opposite replacing the shahs rule with a much more oppressive and violent regime which continues to rule iran
22655,0.2519,0.075,0.828,0.097,but any notion of free expression had been extinguished on that night in shoosh square when what ensued proved to me that i did not have the bravery to pursue counterrevolutionary type aims against a new secret police or army
22656,-0.9001,0.224,0.776,0.0,it was all just a distraction from the real injustice that was going on  the murder of thousands of people including army officers perceived opponents of the new regime and sympathisers of the previous one including actors artists and journalists
22657,-0.1232,0.044,0.956,0.0,im not sure that i ever understood precisely why we were doing what we did but i spent several weeks of spare time at a department of health building close to central tehran

22666,0.4779,0.0,0.886,0.114,although every iranian home would have ja namaz even if as in our case it is not used rezas action was a little surprising  it is rare for iranians to pray when visiting

22676,-0.2263,0.106,0.828,0.066,at one point along the way  it seemed to be the middle of nowhere  our bus was stopped by members of the pasdaran the same revolutionary guard that had arrested my friends in shoosh square a year or so before
22677,-0.7884,0.161,0.79,0.049,they told us to get into one of a number of jeeps they had with them we would be taken down the road to the komiteh station which turned out to be nothing more than an abandoned house with no water and a number of broken windows
22678,-0.1779,0.095,0.831,0.074,my bag was taken and searched and i was relieved when the guard failed to find at the bottom a newspaper of the mek a group that opposed the new regime
22679,0.8327,0.0,0.683,0.317,while not yet illegal having a newspaper like this among my belongings would not have been looked on positively by the pasdaran
22680,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,eventually the pasdaran guard ran out of questions
22681,0.7806,0.041,0.776,0.183,i always felt i could argue my case with the pasdaran but i wasnt so sure about how my father would take finding out that i had been travelling with reza before we were engaged
22682,-0.2746,0.061,0.907,0.033,it was the sort of lie that we were increasingly becoming accustomed to telling people in authority  anything to turn their attention to somewhere or someone else as we were not protected by the rule of law
22683,0.3612,0.0,0.872,0.128,finally the officer had to believe my mother when she assured him that reza was her future soninlaw
22684,-0.1027,0.318,0.682,0.0,the whole building shook
22685,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,people who had been walking around froze where they were
22686,-0.3818,0.178,0.822,0.0,everyone in the computer department seemed to be in a state of shock
22687,-0.4854,0.258,0.624,0.118,we were too frightened to go outside but too scared to stay where we were as well
22688,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,it was one of those rare situations where rather than keeping to themselves everyone was talking
22689,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,when i got home i rushed inside and told my mother to turn on the radio
22690,-0.5994,0.565,0.435,0.0,there is a war
22691,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,war
22692,-0.5994,0.796,0.204,0.0,what war
22693,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  turn on the radio
22694,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the airport was bombed and we were dismissed early
22695,-0.7845,0.301,0.699,0.0,  we soon heard a formal announcement that iraq had attacked iran and we were now at war
22696,-0.8934,0.222,0.778,0.0,there are some parallels with the at times violent disagreements between catholic and protestant christians that have taken place especially in northern ireland with many on both sides not really understanding why or what they are fighting  only that they are fighting the other
22697,-0.9201,0.297,0.703,0.0,this particular war would continue for the next eight years and result in the death or injury of over a million people there are still many crippled men leading difficult lives today as a result
22698,0.4215,0.159,0.569,0.272,the eventual peace agreement reverted the iraniraq border to exactly what it had been before the war
22699,-0.5994,0.151,0.849,0.0,if anything the only achievement was to further entrench the khomeini regime due to the rise in nationalism that always accompanies a war
22700,-0.34,0.133,0.782,0.085,at times it felt like we were living in a world war ii movie as air raid sirens would go off sending us into shelters
22701,-0.5106,0.102,0.898,0.0,my father took a small oil lamp which worried me a lot  power was cut off in the city if incoming iraqi aircraft were detected and i was concerned that a pilot might be guided by this tiny light
22702,-0.5994,0.126,0.874,0.0,however as reza had not seen a lot of his family since returning from australia he spent the early months of the war in karaj with his sister
22703,0.4019,0.0,0.912,0.088,and in any case he had nowhere to stay in tehran  staying with us for a length of time while we were engaged would not have been appropriate
22704,-0.5994,0.237,0.662,0.101,being busy helped me block the war out of my mind safe in the knowledge that soon i would be leaving iran
22705,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,and in my case i would also go to australia
22706,0.4767,0.0,0.846,0.154,it seemed to be something about english language tuition rather than chemistry but i didnt question its value
22707,0.7893,0.0,0.741,0.259,it is quite a grand building and was regarded as an excellent hotel at the time though probably not quite five star
22708,0.3182,0.0,0.796,0.204,and in many respects this was the case for me
22709,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i detested smoking anywhere but especially in my bedroom where i knew the smell of nicotine would get into all my rugs and the satin quilt and silk curtains
22710,-0.4939,0.154,0.846,0.0,however after living my childhood in an atmosphere charged with yelling i was not in the mood to argue with my new husband so soon
22711,-0.1531,0.151,0.849,0.0,initially i tried to avoid the question but he persisted
22712,0.7337,0.0,0.733,0.267,i dont know whether he did or not but i suspect he did as he was a good man
22713,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,finally it was time for the cashier to close his office  at this time they only opened when a plane arrived  which left us stranded in the transit lounge where we spent most of the night
22714,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we flew to singapore where finally reza received a temporary visa allowing him to enter australia for three months
22715,0.2263,0.0,0.894,0.106,instead of flying straight to australia we decided to try bangkok where there was an iranian embassy
22716,0.25,0.0,0.943,0.057,as soon as we had checked in and reza had had a chance to buy his cigarettes we took a taxi to the local australian embassy where my tourist visa application was again declined
22717,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where else would we go
22718,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  i thought we might go to a hotel
22719,0.4404,0.0,0.775,0.225,  no it would be better if we went to shakoors
22720,0.2263,0.0,0.612,0.388,  okay i thought
22721,0.3612,0.0,0.909,0.091,this inconsistency was like a red flag to the official and we were immediately taken to separate rooms to be interviewed and have our bags checked
22722,0.7702,0.0,0.738,0.262,i was never so thankful that i was able to speak english and could explain our situation
22723,0.0258,0.058,0.882,0.06,it is an odd persian custom for those with a qualification to be referred to by their title rather than their name and i had some small pride in using this term in relation to my husband
22724,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we caught a taxi into central melbourne and on the way i said to reza you know the customs officers took that silk carpet
22725,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  really
22726,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  a deep frown crossed his face
22727,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,another time we visited latrobe university where reza said he had been studying
22728,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,after the interview i crossed the road to the park where reza stood waiting for me smoking
22729,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where are you going
22730,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,that is where the australian prostitutes go
22731,-0.3612,0.198,0.7,0.101,i felt shocked and guilty my mothers words  dont do something you have to apologise for  coming to mind
22732,-0.357,0.106,0.894,0.0,id had no interest in cooking in iran and in any case had not needed to as my mother cooked almost everything
22733,-0.5574,0.104,0.896,0.0,when we did have intercourse perhaps only twice a year it was a purely mechanical exercise much as i had seen my parents perform in the gloom of the takhte tavoos basement
22734,0.0772,0.0,0.755,0.245,the kettle that you want
22735,-0.4754,0.382,0.618,0.0,  immediately i felt incredibly guilty
22736,-0.3346,0.229,0.771,0.0,it took some days for this guilt to subside
22737,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,reza ordered a taxi and we left for queen victoria hospital in melbourne at seven in the morning reza sat in the front i sat in the back
22738,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i had not yet had any contractions so was taken upstairs to a ward
22739,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he held our baby and said ali my son
22740,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  when i was back in the ward reza went out to the myer department store and came back with an expensivelooking pram  navy blue with large wheels  and a softtoy koala
22741,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,a thick layer of dust coated everything except the couch where reza had obviously spent most of the last two weeks
22742,-0.2382,0.072,0.928,0.0,not only was all our crockery dirty but it was all over the house  hardly a dish had found its way to the kitchen sink
22743,-0.2498,0.069,0.931,0.0,it took a week before i got the house back to where it had started  it was nowhere near perfect but at least it was liveable again
22744,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,once a day for about 15 minutes reza would exercise standing upright holding his arms out to his sides and then repeatedly pumping his forearms up into a classic bodybuilder pose and back
22745,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he did not use any weights but somehow this single exercise along with a diet of mostly salad and very few baked goods was enough to keep him in shape
22746,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,iran  that is where you should go next he said
22747,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he rarely left the house and when he did he never told me where he was going
22748,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,ali was my priority now along with building a family life with my husband
22749,0.4404,0.133,0.716,0.152,in any case there had not been so much yelling or swearing lately a lack of yelling and swearing was what i now understood as being as close to love and kindness as i would get from this man
22750,-0.6249,0.291,0.61,0.099,as well iran was expensive  the iraniraq war was still being fought at this time
22751,0.2263,0.0,0.936,0.064,instead of flying straight home to melbourne we once again flew to bangkok where we expected to be able to work things out quickly as we had last time
22752,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what is the situation
22753,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, i finally asked reza one day as he sprawled in his chair
22754,-0.34,0.169,0.752,0.079,as tears started to well in my eyes i looked back to see reza at full height step back and slam the door
22755,-0.296,0.155,0.845,0.0,the indignity would be unbearable and in any case i had no money
22756,0.2263,0.0,0.863,0.137,as i prepared to go out reza asked me where i was going
22757,0.7964,0.0,0.787,0.213,though our hotel was very basic it was in the area of a number of high class hotels and there were many beautiful jewellery and gift shops serving their european and american guests
22758,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,get fucked he said and stormed out of the building
22759,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the day before i had taken ali to a doctor
22760,0.2263,0.228,0.414,0.359,i felt like i had been freed from prison
22761,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,returning home shortly afterwards and not having a house key with me i knocked on the door for reza to let us inside
22762,-0.1761,0.074,0.868,0.059,he was very disappointed that not one lead had come from this long trip especially after he had paid for all our travel and our hotel in bangkok not to mention the effort he had taken to help us get our visas
22763,0.8689,0.0,0.682,0.318,inscribed on the inside cover were the words a present by mr ali on mothers day for his kind and dear mother darling sohila
22764,-0.296,0.155,0.845,0.0,i suspect he gambled any profits away as quickly as they were earned
22765,-0.6369,0.16,0.84,0.0,i didnt tell fariba about what was happening either  rezas abuse of me was something i had to manage on my own
22766,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,over the coming years he would use the term more and more many times a day
22767,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this was the case even though we were still temporary residents
22768,0.4767,0.0,0.886,0.114,fariba also said nothing in keeping with the respect at least outwardly that she and mansoor always showed their brotherinlaw in keeping with persian tradition
22769,0.6997,0.0,0.674,0.326,you are very lucky to have come to a country that values civil rights
22770,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  again i said nothing
22771,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,in my mind reza still had all the power in our relationship
22772,-0.25,0.202,0.688,0.11,i had no familiarity with australian law certainly no understanding that i had some rights of my own
22773,-0.0516,0.046,0.954,0.0,i thought simply that if he wanted to take ali and leave me behind he could do so as would have been the case in iran
22774,0.25,0.0,0.933,0.067,divorce in khomeinis iran was nearly always initiated by the male and nearly always resulted in the male being granted most of the possessions and custody of any children
22775,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,this is what had happened to a sisterinlaw of mine
22776,-0.6249,0.255,0.745,0.0,similarly i didnt understand that rezas violence toward me was against the law
22777,-0.4144,0.149,0.763,0.088,in iran he could have done almost whatever he liked with me short of murdering me and he would always remain above the law
22778,-0.8957,0.349,0.651,0.0,in any case i would never press the point for fear of having him lose his temper or worse leaving me and taking ali with him
22779,0.4228,0.0,0.74,0.26,  despite my salary our financial situation hardly improved
22780,-0.2023,0.065,0.935,0.0,in late january 1985 just a few weeks after alis third birthday i confronted reza once again about his gambling and where all our money was going
22781,-0.5719,0.156,0.765,0.079,if not for ali divorce would have been the sweetest word to my ears but i was terrified by the prospect of having my son taken away from me
22782,-0.0516,0.054,0.946,0.0,reza went off to the mens bathroom while ali and i moved to the platform where our train was about to leave
22783,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the doors closed and as the train drew away i caught a glimpse of reza coming down the ramp onto the platform scanning ahead to where he obviously expected to see me waiting for him
22784,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the takeaway store where mansoor worked was nearby so we went to see him
22785,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,however reza knew where that was
22786,-0.128,0.053,0.947,0.0,all of us were soon on a train back into central melbourne where we learnt that due to a strike the overnight train to canberra was not running
22787,-0.4588,0.136,0.864,0.0,we took a room in a small hostel across the road from the bus station where i wept all night
22788,-0.1531,0.086,0.914,0.0,we had no choice but to return to melbourne where mansoor and i at least had some work
22789,-0.6369,0.144,0.856,0.0,it was bad enough that reza knew where i worked and i was shaking when i returned to the wool corporation the next day leaving ali with fariba and mansoor at the hostel
22790,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where is ali
22791,-0.296,0.104,0.896,0.0,worried that he would cause a scene at my workplace i told him about the hostel and where it was
22792,-0.4939,0.225,0.775,0.0,drawn by the fear of ali being taken from me i followed
22793,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,what if reza had taken ali
22794,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where will you go
22795,-0.2263,0.487,0.513,0.0, i stammered
22796,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where will you take ali
22797,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  i take ali was all he said
22798,-0.2247,0.078,0.871,0.051,from this point on reza started sleeping in our spare bedroom where there was less chance of his being disturbed in the mornings ali and i slept in the main bedroom
22799,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,apart from the change in sleeping arrangements i was now left with my old self in my old situation the new sohila having been nothing but a fleeting fantasy
22800,0.6369,0.16,0.412,0.428,my state of pride and perfection and patience and tolerance is broken
22801,0.1779,0.0,0.746,0.254,where is the path to escape
22802,0.1779,0.0,0.746,0.254,where was the escape path indeed
22803,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,my death in life as i saw it continued
22804,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the kananook unit had a small backyard so reza started doing his 15minute exercise regime outside
22805,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,he now added chinups to his armpumping exercise
22806,0.0,0.06,0.881,0.06,one day he came inside closed the screen door behind him that led straight into the kitchen walked across the room and stopped in the doorway of the living room
22807,0.4404,0.0,0.506,0.494,well i want you to apologise
22808,-0.3182,0.204,0.796,0.0,  i ignored him and turned back to the sink
22809,0.4019,0.0,0.769,0.231,only i have the special power to resist these things
22810,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,  so his laziness was in his eyes one special power
22811,-0.5423,0.127,0.873,0.0,he and i would then stay closed up inside for the rest of the day with all his ordering around machismo bad language and smoking
22812,-0.5267,0.227,0.773,0.0,there was no job i suspect he returned home not long after ali and i had left
22813,-0.7845,0.301,0.699,0.0,the rest of that year is a colourless blur of train travel and work arguments and ongoing abuse
22814,-0.34,0.094,0.906,0.0,if reza was not on the sofa he was on the toilet where he spent more and more time as he struggled with haemorrhoids
22815,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,reza had taken a knife to the redandgrey cushions of the metalframed chairs i had bought on hire purchase at myer not one month previously
22816,0.34,0.0,0.897,0.103,where the idea came from i dont know though it could have been from the play dough ali had as a toy
22817,0.7964,0.0,0.818,0.182,the uncharacteristic inspiration came to him as he sat in front of the television flexing his hands and for him it was the perfect exercise one that could be done while doing nothing else
22818,-0.2023,0.151,0.755,0.094,money was initially taken from what little we had left over from my salary and later our unemployment benefit after i stopped working with my second child
22819,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,over the next two years we would sink nearly 20000 into this idea
22820,0.5267,0.062,0.833,0.105,his exercise of power over me was made stronger by the fact that i was now at home again full time having taken a years maternity leave from the wool corporation from which i would not return as reza refused to do anything to care for either ali or shirin
22821,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,we lived in a prisonlike atmosphere where everyone is permanently on edge
22822,-0.296,0.066,0.934,0.0,ali and shirin could not watch cartoons as reza chose the tv channel and no one was allowed to change it  even as he spent long periods sitting on the toilet

22824,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i made his soup 10 minutes late and he upended the whole pot down the sink
22825,-0.2023,0.215,0.625,0.16,the truth is my situation is getting worse from every angle
22826,-0.3449,0.122,0.799,0.08,he grabbed me and threw me on the grass and started to ask me why i was so mad and i said death has more value than this life
22827,-0.5423,0.164,0.836,0.0,while this went on ali and shirin were left inside the house then ali came out after us while shirin hid under her bed crying
22828,-0.4588,0.231,0.769,0.0,once again i saw myself living out my mothers imprisoned life
22829,0.5719,0.072,0.765,0.163,after we had finished i decided to take ali and shirin to the small park next to our block where i enjoyed a break from reza and the children enjoyed the swings and seesaw
22830,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,where have you been
22831,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0, said reza when we returned
22832,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,she will teach you a lesson
22833,-0.3818,0.148,0.852,0.0,  then i went to my room where i cried for the rest of the afternoon
22834,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,they returned with them to his flat where they would stay i joined them with the children a little later
22835,-0.8358,0.241,0.657,0.102,in part i had not wanted to worry her but just as she had always done herself i had also accepted all the abuse and poverty as unchangeable aspects of my life
22836,-0.5106,0.078,0.922,0.0,and they had talked to my siblings who while not knowing everything were old enough now in their midtwenties to be able to read between the bruises and the poverty and have some idea of what i was going through
22837,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i would learn later that a letter from mansoor saying they needed to see the state of sohila had been the catalyst for my parents coming to australia in the first place
22838,-0.4767,0.215,0.681,0.104,perhaps he sensed my parents unease at the poverty of our unit because at one point he said things will get better
22839,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,the discussion around the table turned to my situation
22840,-0.5994,0.394,0.606,0.0,you cant continue this life of torture
22841,-0.1154,0.088,0.912,0.0,  tears ran down my cheeks but i didnt  couldnt  speak for some time

23177,0.3777,0.134,0.721,0.145,naturally she had nothing to smile about when she heard of her husbands death but the proscription on smiling meant that she could not behave in any natural human way for years to comeshe could not even smile for her children

23312,-0.2732,0.253,0.611,0.136,there was no question that i loved behnam but his outburst had confused me
23313,0.5106,0.0,0.677,0.323,love is deep certainly but so is conviction including political conviction
23314,-0.128,0.233,0.55,0.217,i was sick at heart because the things that had the deepest hold on me were at war with my affections
23315,0.9313,0.0,0.535,0.465,surely love is about the liberty of the soul and my politics were also about the liberty of the soul
23316,0.7003,0.066,0.723,0.211,it would be true to say that i had no real expectation of being kidnapped in the heart of tehran and hustled off to an interrogation cell

23319,-0.4767,0.22,0.78,0.0,our bickering was only ever suspended when behnam answered his cell phone
23320,0.7732,0.0,0.873,0.127,he would also concede that the regime was content to subvert the constitution in any way it liked that it maintained a secret police force as disgraceful as savak that corruption within the higher echelons of the regime ran rampant that women had less legislated freedom than slaves
23321,0.743,0.0,0.73,0.27,it is almost an occupational hazard of being female this profound conviction that love will bring about desired change
23322,0.4404,0.084,0.722,0.194,there is certainly no evidence to support this conviction not anywhere in the world that exists here and now or in history
23323,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,my mother saw in him a protector for me and when all is said and done mothers everywhere are inclined to opt for sonsinlaw who will provide for their daughters and keep them out of harms way

23325,0.5267,0.0,0.871,0.129,and i was my fathers daughter when it  came to politics although i placed the emphasis on personal liberty more pointedly than he did
23326,0.296,0.127,0.637,0.235,in this desperately conflicted state i agreed one day to accompany behnam to a wedding party
23327,-0.1531,0.076,0.882,0.041,one could dress to demonstrate the undiluted fundamentalism of ones husband leaving barely a square inch of skin exposed and one could dress to show proper respect for the statutes of the state without going overboard a vestment worn to cover ones form from shoulders to lower calf in any of a half dozen fairly subdued colors a scarf to cover the hair a little lipstick some eyeliner some blush

23329,-0.5423,0.179,0.821,0.0, behnam spoke in that tone of outraged conviction so false that i had learned to detest

23331,0.6187,0.08,0.746,0.174,its good to have someone i know nearby but this consolation has its limitations two powerless people can do little more than sympathize with each other and of all forms of relief a person might crave in my situation sympathy is the least availing
23332,0.4939,0.027,0.845,0.128,it is the practical that i find myself dwelling on in this cell the need to get a message out is only the foremost longing after that things such as hygiene occupy my thoughts the yearning to be clean

23337,0.83,0.0,0.783,0.217,reminding me of happy times merely makes the concrete walls seem that much more impenetrable the air in my cell that much more listless and joy that much more distant

23346,-0.7822,0.316,0.559,0.124,its as pitiless a place as anywhere in evin but to me so sick of the stink of my own body it is heaven
23347,-0.5106,0.099,0.901,0.0,i shut the door before removing my prison tunic then abruptly jump as if a bare electrical wire had been jabbed into my back when the guard kicks the door open

23382,-0.5106,0.073,0.927,0.0,i need someone who can provide something even more  comfortinga key to the door of my cell a second key to the gate of the prison a car to carry me to some place where the police and interrogators can never find me
23383,-0.8442,0.412,0.588,0.0,my whole body itches with the irritation of hairs that have fallen inside my prison tunic

23386,-0.8402,0.155,0.845,0.0,but by the time id completed high school and a year at tehran university i had studied enough history to know that every country has its mullahs every country has its dogmatists and zealots every country has at some time brought down an iron fist on those who question coax condemn criticize
23387,-0.7506,0.225,0.775,0.0,i didnt know of the reign of joseph mccarthy in early postworld war ii america i hadnt heard the term witch hunt applied metaphorically
23388,0.9161,0.022,0.798,0.18,it was not that i was lost in fantasizing over a wildly handsome spaniard who happened to be gay not that i knew that but rather that my developing sense of justice was nourished by the story at least the short less complicated version of his artistic and political commitment a commitment that eventually cost him his life at the hands of licensed police thugs
23389,0.25,0.083,0.799,0.118,when i reflect on the psychological process that led me into the streets to shout and argue i always get back to that word justice
23390,0.8588,0.0,0.513,0.487,like most children i grew up with a very strong sense of justice
23391,0.8922,0.0,0.453,0.547,but isnt it wonderful how the belief in justice endures
23392,0.7003,0.0,0.507,0.493,for a number of my fellow persians justice was god
23393,0.872,0.0,0.696,0.304,for me at the age of nineteen justice was the right of girls like myself to exercise their powers and abilities and talents without the interference of the clergy
23394,0.6369,0.0,0.856,0.144,my freedom to walk down the street with the wind in my hair wouldnt have meant a thing unless all persian girls could do the same
23395,0.7096,0.0,0.459,0.541,how can liberty ever be a privilege
23396,0.5423,0.107,0.629,0.264,i suppose dalís conception of freedom was simply too weird for me
23397,0.5267,0.0,0.764,0.236,my idea of liberty was simple enough to be  thought primitive almost
23398,-0.8625,0.189,0.811,0.0,but some numskull of a boy in his late teens licensed by the mullahs of my country to bully me when my scarf slipped an inch too far off my forehead to lecture me menace mewell that was intolerable
23399,0.6597,0.0,0.852,0.148,i read as many of garcía lorcas plays and poems as i could lay my hands on and while i read i felt the quickening of that sense of justice i spoke about
23400,0.7469,0.089,0.662,0.25,but i absorbed the sensibility behind the stories and poems a sensibility that created vivid images of struggle of the souls imprisonment and of freedom
23401,0.2732,0.156,0.612,0.231,the struggle was for liberty that was how i conceived it
23402,0.6486,0.046,0.79,0.163,i think most people who find themselves shaking their fists at the mullahs of their countries first find a person often a writer who helps them define what they mean by liberty
23403,0.6369,0.086,0.656,0.258,even when the subject is disguised the real theme of good poetry is liberty at least in my opinion
23404,-0.0495,0.173,0.703,0.124,i have never read a fine poem or story that condoned repression and rejoiced in the unfettered power of mullahs
23405,0.8225,0.0,0.691,0.309,the liberty of language had found its way into my heart years before garcía lorca came into my life
23406,0.5106,0.0,0.798,0.202,i read in a state of ecstatic transportnovels film magazines newspapers books on politics
23407,0.9156,0.035,0.671,0.293,more concealed were the books by sadeq hedayat and mohammad ali jamalzadeh great heroes of contemporary persian literature novelists who were truly subversive of authority in both their politics and their insistence on employing simple clear prose that did not hide its meaning
23408,0.8573,0.0,0.833,0.167,the theme i was searching for was given focus by garcía lorca then by the basiji but it was only when i saw my cousin in the hospital most of her skin burned from her body that i truly developed a conviction about justice
23409,0.5859,0.0,0.817,0.183,id thought of her as one of those people for whom joy was a normal state of being

23429,-0.128,0.152,0.712,0.136, it is as if  someone preparing to rape me should have the temerity to refer to what he is doing as making love
